# LIRcentral_curation_tools

This repository contains computer code (including Python notebooks), Machine Lerning Models and data files related to the processing/analysis of biomedical texts for facilitating the curation of the (LIRcentral database)[https://lircentral.eu].

This work has been possible through a grant awarded to the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](https://vprobon.github.io/BRL-UCY) at the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy) for the [LIRcentral project](https://lircentral.eu/).

LIRcentral has co-funded between 2022-2024 by the European Union (European Regional Development Fund, ERDF) and the Republic of Cyprus through the project EXCELLENCE/0421/0576 under the EXCELLENCE HUBS programme of the [Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation](https://research.org.cy).


An online, freely available Python Notebook for training/validating/saving/using ML methods for LIRcentral-related texts classification can be accessed online at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HkmtTsTJDx9qNaI9vgEVtQOn0Qlx9vv7?usp=sharing).
