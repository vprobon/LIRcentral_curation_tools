The C/EBPbeta isoform  liver-inhibitory protein (LIP)  induces autophagy in breast cancer cell lines.Autophagy is a process involving the bulk degradation of cellular components in the cytoplasm via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Autophagy manifests a protective role in stressful conditions such as nutrient or growth factor depletion; however  extensive degradation of regulatory molecules or organelles essential for survival can lead to the demise of the cell  or autophagy-mediated cell death. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex with roles in both tumor suppression and tumor promotion proposed. Here we report that an isoform of the C/EBPbeta transcription factor  liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP)  induces cell death in human breast cancer cells and stimulates autophagy. Overexpression of LIP is incompatible with cell growth and when cell cycle analysis was performed  a DNA profile of cells undergoing apoptosis was not observed. Instead  LIP expressing cells appeared to have large autophagic vesicles when examined via electron microscopy. Autophagy was further assessed in LIP expressing cells by monitoring the development of acidic vesicular organelles and conversion of LC3 from the cytoplasmic form to the membrane-bound form. Our work shows that C/EBPbeta isoform  LIP  is another member of the group of transcription factors  including E2F1 and p53  which are capable of playing a role in autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
FRS2α-mediated FGF signals suppress premature differentiation of cardiac stem cells through regulating autophagy activity.Although the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling axis plays important roles in heart development  the molecular mechanism by which the FGF regulates cardiogenesis is not fully understood.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dihydromyricetin improves skeletal muscle insulin resistance by inducing autophagy via the AMPK signaling pathway.Skeletal muscle insulin resistance (SMIR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Dihydromyricetin (DHM)  a natural flavonoid  exerts various bioactivities including anti-oxidative and hepatoprotective effects. Herein  we intended to determine the effect of DHM on SMIR and the underlying mechanisms. We found that DHM increased the expression of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1  phosphorylated Akt and glucose uptake capacity in palmitate-treated L6 myotubes under insulin-stimulated conditions. The expression of light chain 3  Beclin 1  autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5)  the degradation of sequestosome 1 and the formation of autophagosomes were also upregulated by DHM. Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 or Atg5 and Beclin1 siRNA abolished the favorable effects of DHM on SMIR. Furthermore  DHM increased the levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Ulk1  and decreased phosphorylated mTOR levels. AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC) and AMPK siRNA abrogated DHM-induced autophagy  subsequently suppressed DHM-induced SMIR improvement. Additionally  DHM inhibited the activity of F1F0-ATPase thereby activating AMPK. Finally  the results of in vivo study conducted in high fat diet-fed rats were consistent with the findings of in vitro study. In conclusion  DHM improved SMIR by inducing autophagy via the activation of AMPK signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Stellettin A induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in murine B16 melanoma cells.Isomalabaricanes are a small class of rearranged triterpenoids obtained from marine sponges. Most of these are cytotoxic to tumor cells  but the underlying mechanism is not clear. In this study  it was demonstrated that stellettin A (1)  obtained from Geodia japonica  inhibited the growth of B16F10 murine melanoma cells by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins. Immunoblotting analysis revealed abnormal glycosylation patterns of two melanoma marker proteins  tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1  and the retention of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Compound 1 induced the upregulation of the unfolded protein chaperone  glucose-regulated protein 78  in a dose-dependent manner. Increase of autophagosome-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) in a membrane-bound form (LC3II) and its immunofluorescence co-localization with tyrosinase suggest the possible removal of deglycosylated and unfolded proteins by autophagy of the cells. There was no change in either the expression of the apoptosis marker protein Bcl-2 or the appearance of apoptotic nuclei in 1-treated cells. Taken together  1 is an endoplasmic reticulum stressor that inhibits the growth of B16 melanoma cells by induction of abnormal protein glycosylation and autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy genes Smatg8 and Smatg4 are required for fruiting-body development  vegetative growth and ascospore germination in the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora.Autophagy is a tightly controlled degradation process involved in various developmental aspects of eukaryotes. However  its involvement in developmental processes of multicellular filamentous ascomycetes is largely unknown. Here  we analyzed the impact of the autophagic proteins SmATG8 and SmATG4 on the sexual and vegetative development of the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae complementation assay demonstrated that the S. macrospora Smatg8 and Smatg4 genes can functionally replace the yeast homologs. By generating homokaryotic deletion mutants  we showed that the S. macrospora SmATG8 and SmATG4 orthologs were associated with autophagy-dependent processes. Smatg8 and Smatg4 deletions abolished fruiting-body formation and impaired vegetative growth and ascospore germination  but not hyphal fusion. We demonstrated that SmATG4 was capable of processing the SmATG8 precursor. SmATG8 was localized to autophagosomes  whereas SmATG4 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of S. macrospora. Furthermore  we could show that Smatg8 and Smatg4 are not only required for nonselective macroautophagy  but for selective macropexophagy as well. Taken together  our results suggest that in S. macrospora  autophagy seems to be an essential and constitutively active process to sustain high energy levels for filamentous growth and multicellular development even under nonstarvation conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Drosophila homolog of Aut1 is essential for autophagy and development.The Drosophila homolog of yeast Aut1  CG6877/Draut1  is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein. Draut1 loss of function was achieved by expression of an inverted repeat transgene inducing RNA interference. The effect is temperature-dependent and resembles an allelic series as described by Fortier  E. and Belote  J.M. (Genesis 26 (2000) 240-244). Draut1 loss of function larvae are unable to induce autophagy and heterophagy in fat body cells before pupariation and die during metamorphosis. To our knowledge  this is the first report of a multicellular animal lacking the function of a gene participating in the protein conjugation systems of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy stimulation by rapamycin suppresses lung inflammation and infection by Burkholderia cenocepacia in a model of cystic fibrosis.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited lethal disease of Caucasians which results in multi organ dysfunction. However  85% of the deaths are due to pulmonary infections. Infection by Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cepacia) is a particularly lethal threat to CF patients because it causes severe and persistent lung inflammation and is resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. In CFTR ΔF508 mouse macrophages  B. cepacia persists in vacuoles that do not fuse with the lysosomes and mediates increased production of IL-1β. It is believed that intracellular bacterial survival contributes to the persistence of the bacterium. Here we show for the first time that in wild-type macrophages but not in ΔF508 macrophages  many B. cepacia reside in autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes at later stages of infection. Accordingly  association and intracellular survival of B. cepacia are higher in CFTR-ΔF508 (ΔF508) macrophages than in WT macrophages. An autophagosome is a compartment that engulfs non-functional organelles and parts of the cytoplasm then delivers them to the lysosome for degradation to produce nutrients during periods of starvation or stress. Furthermore  we show that B. cepacia downregulates autophagy genes in WT and ΔF508 macrophages. However  autophagy dysfunction is more pronounced in ΔF508 macrophages since they already have compromised autophagy activity. We demonstrate that the autophagy-stimulating agent  rapamycin markedly decreases B. cepacia infection in vitro by enhancing the clearance of B. cepacia via induced autophagy. In vivo  Rapamycin decreases bacterial burden in the lungs of CF mice and drastically reduces signs of lung inflammation. Together  our studies reveal that if efficiently activated  autophagy can control B. cepacia infection and ameliorate the associated inflammation. Therefore  autophagy is a novel target for new drug development for CF patients to control B. cepacia infection and accompanying inflammation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis in the liver.Autophagy is defined as any process whereby cellular macromolecules destined for degradation gain access to the lysosomes.

Failure of amino acid homeostasis causes cell death following proteasome inhibition.The ubiquitin-proteasome system targets many cellular proteins for degradation and thereby controls most cellular processes. Although it is well established that proteasome inhibition is lethal  the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here  we show that proteasome inhibition results in a lethal amino acid shortage. In yeast  mammalian cells  and flies  the deleterious consequences of proteasome inhibition are rescued by amino acid supplementation. In all three systems  this rescuing effect occurs without noticeable changes in the levels of proteasome substrates. In mammalian cells  the amino acid scarcity resulting from proteasome inhibition is the signal that causes induction of both the integrated stress response and autophagy  in an unsuccessful attempt to replenish the pool of intracellular amino acids. These results reveal that cells can tolerate protein waste  but not the amino acid scarcity resulting from proteasome inhibition.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy sustains the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus in host cells.In this study  we confirmed the autophagy induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in permissive cells and investigated the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV. We first demonstrated that PRRSV infection significantly results in the increased double-membrane vesicles  the accumulation of LC3 fluorescence puncta  and the raised ratio of LC3-II/β-actin  in MARC-145 cells. Then we discovered that induction of autophagy by rapamycin significantly enhances the viral titers of PRRSV  while inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA and silencing of LC3 gene by siRNA reduces the yield of PRRSV. The results showed functional autolysosomes can be formed after PRRSV infection and the autophagosome-lysosome-fusion inhibitor decreases the virus titers. We also examined the induction of autophagy by PRRSV infection in pulmonary alveolar macrophages. These findings indicate that autophagy induced by PRRSV infection plays a role in sustaining the replication of PRRSV in host cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aggresomes and pericentriolar sites of virus assembly: cellular defense or viral design?Virus replication and virus assembly often occur in virus inclusions or virus factories that form at pericentriolar sites close to the microtubule organizing center or in specialized nuclear domains called ND10/PML bodies. Similar inclusions called aggresomes form in response to protein aggregation. Protein aggregates are toxic to cells and are transported along microtubules to aggresomes for immobilization and subsequent degradation by proteasomes and/or autophagy. The similarity between aggresomes and virus inclusions raises the possibility that viruses use aggresome pathways to concentrate cellular and viral proteins to facilitate replication and assembly. Alternatively  aggresomes may be part of an innate cellular response that recognizes virus components as foreign or misfolded and targets them for storage and degradation. Insights into the possible roles played by aggresomes during virus assembly are emerging from an understanding of how virus inclusions form and how viral proteins are targeted to them.,Autophagy_notLIR

mTOR and cancer therapy.Proteins regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  as well as some of the targets of the mTOR kinase  are overexpressed or mutated in cancer. Rapamycin  the naturally occurring inhibitor of mTOR  along with a number of recently developed rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) consisting of synthetically derived compounds containing minor chemical modifications to the parent structure  inhibit the growth of cell lines derived from multiple tumor types in vitro  and tumor models in vivo. Results from clinical trials indicate that the rapalogs may be useful for the treatment of subsets of certain types of cancer. The sporadic responses from the initial clinical trials  based on the hypothesis of general translation inhibition of cancer cells are now beginning to be understood owing to a more complete understanding of the dynamics of mTOR regulation and the function of mTOR in the tumor microenvironment. This review will summarize the preclinical and clinical data and recent discoveries of the function of mTOR in cancer and growth regulation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Potent synergistic interaction between the Nampt inhibitor APO866 and the apoptosis activator TRAIL in human leukemia cells.The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) inhibitor APO866 depletes intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and shows promising anticancer activity in preclinical studies. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) binds to plasma membrane receptors DR4 and DR5 and induces apoptosis via caspase-8 and -10. Here we have explored the interaction between APO866 and TRAIL in leukemia cell lines and in primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
A methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum fruiting body inhibits the growth of a gastric cancer cell line and affects cellular autophagy and cell cycle.Ganoderma lucidum is one of the most extensively studied mushrooms as a functional food and as a chemopreventive agent due to its recognized medicinal properties. Some G. lucidum extracts have shown promising antitumor potential. In this study  the bioactive properties of various extracts of G. lucidum  from both the fruiting body and the spores  were investigated. The most potent extract identified was the methanolic fruiting body extract  which inhibited the growth of a gastric cancer cell line (AGS) by interfering with cellular autophagy and cell cycle.,Autophagy_notLIR
TLR4-dependent tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells (TICs) in alcohol-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis.Alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and synergistically heightens the HCC risk in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The mechanisms of this synergism have been elusive until our recent demonstration of the obligatory role of ectopically expressed TLR4 in liver tumorigenesis in alcohol-fed HCV Ns5a or Core transgenic mice. CD133+/CD49f+ tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells (TICs) isolated from these models are tumorigenic in a manner dependent on TLR4 and NANOG. TICs' tumor-initiating activity and chemoresistance are causally associated with inhibition of TGF-β tumor suppressor pathway due to NANOG-mediated expression of IGF2BP3 and YAP1. TLR4/NANOG activation causes p53 degradation via phosphorylation of the protective protein NUMB and its dissociation from p53 by the oncoprotein TBC1D15. Nutrient deprivation reduces overexpressed TBC1D15 in TICs via autophagy-mediated degradation  suggesting a possible role of this oncoprotein in linking metabolic reprogramming and self-renewal.,Autophagy_notLIR
Association between waist circumference and gray matter volume in 2344 individuals from two adult community-based samples.We analyzed the putative association between abdominal obesity (measured in waist circumference) and gray matter volume (Study of Health in Pomerania: SHIP-2  N=758) adjusted for age and gender by applying volumetric analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with VBM8 to brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We sought replication in a second  independent population sample (SHIP-TREND  N=1586). In a combined analysis (SHIP-2 and SHIP-TREND) we investigated the impact of hypertension  type II diabetes and blood lipids on the association between waist circumference and gray matter. Volumetric analysis revealed a significant inverse association between waist circumference and gray matter volume. VBM in SHIP-2 indicated distinct inverse associations in the following structures for both hemispheres: frontal lobe  temporal lobes  pre- and postcentral gyrus  supplementary motor area  supramarginal gyrus  insula  cingulate gyrus  caudate nucleus  olfactory sulcus  para-/hippocampus  gyrus rectus  amygdala  globus pallidus  putamen  cerebellum  fusiform and lingual gyrus  (pre-) cuneus and thalamus. These areas were replicated in SHIP-TREND. More than 76% of the voxels with significant gray matter volume reduction in SHIP-2 were also distinct in TREND. These brain areas are involved in cognition  attention to interoceptive signals as satiety or reward and control food intake. Due to our cross-sectional design we cannot clarify the causal direction of the association. However  previous studies described an association between subjects with higher waist circumference and future cognitive decline suggesting a progressive brain alteration in obese subjects. Pathomechanisms may involve chronic inflammation  increased oxidative stress or cellular autophagy associated with obesity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA enhances IL-24-induced apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.Interleukin-24(IL-24)  also referred to as melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7(mda-7)  is a unique member of the IL-10 gene family  which displays nearly ubiquitous cancer-specific toxicity. The most notable feature of IL-24 is selectively induced growth suppression and apoptosis in various cancer cells  with no harmful effects toward normal cells. Autophagy is a self-protective mechanism in many kinds of tumor cells that respond to anticancer treatment. It is reported that autophagy inhibition could enhance the effects of many kinds of anticancer treatments  including gene therapy. However  whether IL-24 is effective to treat oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and if autophagy inhibition could improve the anticancer effect of IL-24 towards OSCC is has not been detected.,Autophagy_notLIR
CERT depletion predicts chemotherapy benefit and mediates cytotoxic and polyploid-specific cancer cell death through autophagy induction.Chromosomal instability (CIN) has been implicated in multidrug resistance and the silencing of the ceramide transporter  CERT  promotes sensitization to diverse cytotoxics. An improved understanding of mechanisms governing multidrug sensitization might provide insight into pathways contributing to the death of CIN cancer cells. Using an integrative functional genomics approach  we find that CERT-specific multidrug sensitization is associated with enhanced autophagosome-lysosome flux  resulting from the expression of LAMP2 following CERT silencing in colorectal and HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. Live cell microscopy analysis revealed that CERT depletion induces LAMP2-dependent death of polyploid cells following exit from mitosis in the presence of paclitaxel. We find that CERT is relatively over-expressed in HER2(+) breast cancer and CERT protein expression acts as an independent prognostic variable and predictor of outcome in adjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients with primary breast cancer. These data suggest that the induction of LAMP2-dependent autophagic flux through CERT targeting may provide a rational approach to enhance multidrug sensitization and potentiate the death of polyploid cells following paclitaxel exposure to limit the acquisition of CIN and intra-tumour heterogeneity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Metformin alleviates hepatosteatosis by restoring SIRT1-mediated autophagy induction via an AMP-activated protein kinase-independent pathway.Metformin activates both PRKA and SIRT1. Furthermore  autophagy is induced by either the PRKA-MTOR-ULK1 or SIRT1-FOXO signaling pathways. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which metformin alleviates hepatosteatosis by examining the molecular interplay between SIRT1  PRKA  and autophagy. ob/ob mice were divided into 3 groups: one with ad libitum feeding of a standard chow diet  one with 300 mg/kg intraperitoneal metformin injections  and one with 3 g/d caloric restriction (CR) for a period of 4 wk. Primary hepatocytes or HepG2 cells were treated with oleic acid (OA) plus high glucose in the absence or presence of metformin. Both CR and metformin significantly improved body weight and glucose homeostasis  along with hepatic steatosis  in ob/ob mice. Furthermore  CR and metformin both upregulated SIRT1 expression and also stimulated autophagy induction and flux in vivo. Metformin also prevented OA with high glucose-induced suppression of both SIRT1 expression and SIRT1-dependent activation of autophagy machinery  thereby alleviating intracellular lipid accumulation in vitro. Interestingly  metformin treatment upregulated SIRT1 expression and activated PRKA even after siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRKAA1/2 and SIRT1  respectively. Taken together  these results suggest that metformin alleviates hepatic steatosis through PRKA-independent  SIRT1-mediated effects on the autophagy machinery.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy dysfunction and ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in Dictyostelium cells lacking Vmp1.Ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates are a hallmark of many degenerative diseases. Their presence can be induced by dysfunction in protein degradation pathways such as proteasome and autophagy. We now report several lines of evidence suggesting a defect in autophagy in Dictyostelium cells lacking Vmp1 (vacuole membrane protein 1)  an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in pathological processes such as cancer and pancreatitis. vmp1- null cells are unable to survive starvation or undergo autophagic cell death under the appropriate inductive signals. Moreover  confocal studies using the autophagy marker Atg8 and previous transmission electron microscopy analysis showed defects in autophagosome formation. Although Vmp1 is localized in the ER  we found colocalization with Atg8 suggesting a contribution of both Vmp1 and ER in autophagosome biogenesis or maturation. Interestingly  vmp1- mutant cells showed accumulation of huge ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates containing the autophagy marker GFP-Atg8 and the putative Dictyostelium p62 homologue as described in many degenerative human diseases. The analysis of other Dictyostelium autophagic mutants (atg1-  atg5-  atg6-  atg7- and atg8-) showed a correlation in the severity of their corresponding phenotypes and the presence of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates suggesting that the deleterious effects associated with development of these aggregates might contribute to the complex phenotypes observed in autophagy deficient mutants. Our results suggest that Vmp1 is required for the clearance of these ubiquitinated protein aggregates through autophagy and highlight a potential role for Vmp1 in protein-aggregation diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in stem and progenitor cells.Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process  responsible for the degradation and recycling of damaged and/or outlived proteins and organelles. This is the major cellular pathway  acting throughout the formation of cytosolic vesicles  called autophagosomes  for the delivering to lysosome. Recycling of cellular components through autophagy is a crucial step for cell homeostasis as well as for tissue remodelling during development. Impairment of this process has been related to the pathogenesis of various diseases  such as cancer and neurodegeneration  to the response to bacterial and viral infections  and to ageing. The ability of stem cells to self-renew and differentiate into the mature cells of the body renders this unique type of cell highly crucial to development and tissue renewal  not least in various diseases. During the last two decades  extensive knowledge about autophagy roles and regulation in somatic cells has been acquired; however  the picture about the role and the regulation of autophagy in the different types of stem cells is still largely unknown. Autophagy is a major player in the quality control and maintenance of cellular homeostasis  both crucial factors for stem cells during an organism's life. In this review  we have highlighted the most significant advances in the comprehension of autophagy regulation in embryonic and tissue stem cells  as well as in cancer stem cells and induced pluripotent cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nutrient deprivation increases vulnerability of endothelial cells to proinflammatory insults.Nutrient deprivation is a stimulus for oxidative stress and is an established method for induction of cell autophagy and apoptosis. The aims of this study were to identify conditions that evoke superoxide production in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)  determine the mechanism of action for this response  and examine whether the stimulus might facilitate the adhesion of human isolated neutrophils to the HUVECs. HUVECs were incubated in M199 medium under conditions of serum starvation (serum-free M199 medium)  low serum (medium containing 2% fetal calf serum)  and high serum (medium containing 20% fetal calf serum). HUVECs were also incubated under proinflammatory conditions  in medium supplemented with 50ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or neutrophils preactivated with 10nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Superoxide production was increased fourfold in serum-starved HUVECs compared to cells incubated in 20% medium  and this was reduced by inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter. Superoxide production was 23.6% higher in HUVECs incubated with TNF-α in 2% medium compared to 2% medium alone  but unchanged with TNF-α in 20% medium. PMA-activated neutrophils adhered to morphologically aberrant HUVECs  which were mainly evident under the low-serum condition. The findings show a role of mitochondrial enzymes in superoxide production in response to nutrient deprivation and suggest that proinflammatory responses in HUVECs become manifest when HUVECs are in an already-compromised state.,Autophagy_notLIR

Bovine viral diarrhea virus infection induces autophagy in MDBK cells.Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an enveloped  positive-sense  single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Pestivirus (Flaviviridae). The signaling pathways and levels of signaling molecules are altered in Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells infected with BVDV. Autophagy is a conservative biological degradation pathway that mainly eliminates and degrades damaged or superfluous organelles and macromolecular complexes for intracellular recycling in eukaryotic cells. Autophagy can also be induced as an effective response to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to different stresses  such as nutrient or growth factor deprivation  hypoxia  reactive oxygen species exposure and pathogen infection. However  the effects of BVDV infection on autophagy in MDBK cells remain unclear. Therefore  we performed an analysis of autophagic activity after BVDV NADL infection using real-time PCR  electron microscopy  laser confocal microscopy  and Western blotting analysis. The results demonstrated that BVDV NADL infection increased autophagic activity and significantly elevated the expression levels of the autophagy-related genes Beclin1 and ATG14 in MDBK cells. However  the knockdown of Beclin1 and ATG14 by RNA interference (RNAi) did not affect BVDV NADL infection-related autophagic activity. These findings provided a novel perspective to elaborate the effects of viral infection on the host cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
An autophagic vacuolar myopathy-like disorder presenting as nonimmune hydrops in a female fetus.A 37-year-old woman presented for routine obstetrical care at 15 weeks' gestational age and the fetus was found to have hydrops fetalis. Following elective termination of the pregnancy at 18 weeks' gestational age  pathologic examination of the female conceptus revealed findings suggestive of a lysosomal storage disease within the liver and cardiac muscle. Enzyme assays for beta-galactosidase  neuraminidase  alpha-l-iduronidase  beta-glucuronidase  beta-glucosidase  Morquio disease type A enzyme  beta-fucosidase  alpha-mannosidase  and beta-mannosidase were all normal  ruling out many of the common storage diseases. Electron microscopy identified vacuoles within hepatocytes  Kupffer cells  and cardiac myocytes resembling the autophagic vacuoles characteristic of a group of diseases known as the autophagic vacuolar myopathies (AVMs). Because these diseases are exceptionally rare in females  and because such autophagic vacuoles have never before been described in liver  we propose a novel entity of "AVM-like lysosomal storage disease" presenting as nonimmune hydrops in a female fetus.,Autophagy_notLIR
Glutamate induces mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and autophagy activation: preventive effects of selenium.Glutamate-induced cytotoxicity is partially mediated by enhanced oxidative stress. The objectives of the present study are to determine the effects of glutamate on mitochondrial membrane potential  oxygen consumption  mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy regulating factors and to explore the protective effects of selenium against glutamate cytotoxicity in murine neuronal HT22 cells. Our results demonstrated that glutamate resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner and supplementation of 100 nM sodium selenite prevented the detrimental effects of glutamate on cell survival. The glutamate induced cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial hyperpolarization  increased ROS production and enhanced oxygen consumption. Selenium reversed these alterations. Furthermore  glutamate increased the levels of mitochondrial fission protein markers pDrp1 and Fis1 and caused increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Selenium corrected the glutamate-caused mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and reduced the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria. Finally  glutamate activated autophagy markers Beclin 1 and LC3-II  while selenium prevented the activation. These results suggest that glutamate targets the mitochondria and selenium supplementation within physiological concentration is capable of preventing the detrimental effects of glutamate on the mitochondria. Therefore  adequate selenium supplementation may be an efficient strategy to prevent the detrimental glutamate toxicity and further studies are warranted to define the therapeutic potentials of selenium in animal disease models and in human.,Autophagy_notLIR
Integrated regulation of motor-driven organelle transport by scaffolding proteins.Intracellular trafficking pathways  including endocytosis  autophagy  and secretion  rely on directed organelle transport driven by the opposing microtubule motor proteins kinesin and dynein. Precise spatial and temporal targeting of vesicles and organelles requires the integrated regulation of these opposing motors  which are often bound simultaneously to the same cargo. Recent progress demonstrates that organelle-associated scaffolding proteins  including Milton/TRAKs (trafficking kinesin-binding protein)  JIP1  JIP3 (JNK-interacting proteins)  huntingtin  and Hook1  interact with molecular motors to coordinate activity and sustain unidirectional transport. Scaffolding proteins also bind to upstream regulatory proteins  including kinases and GTPases  to modulate transport in the cell. This integration of regulatory control with motor activity allows for cargo-specific changes in the transport or targeting of organelles in response to cues from the complex cellular environment.,Autophagy_notLIR
ROS-dependent prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) up-regulation and ceramide generation are the prime signaling events associated with curcumin-induced autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma.Malignant gliomas are extremely resistant to therapies that induce apoptosis  but are less resistant to therapies that induce autophagy. Therefore  drugs targeting autophagy are promising in the management of malignant gliomas. In this study  we investigated the anti-glioma potential of curcumin in vitro  and further examined the molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced cell death in human malignant glioma. Here  we provide evidence that curcumin is cytotoxic against human malignant glioma cell lines  and the mechanism of cell death caused by curcumin is associated with features of autophagy. Curcumin suppresses the growth of human malignant glioma cells via ROS-dependent prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) induction and ceramide generation. Extracellular supplementation of antioxidants such as glutathione and N-acetylcysteine to glioma cells abrogated the Par-4 induction  ceramide generation  and in turn  prevented curcumin-induced autophagic cell death. Moreover  tumor cells transfected with Par-4 gene sensitized the curcumin-induced autophagic cell death. Overall  this study describes a novel signaling pathway by which curcumin induces ROS-dependent Par-4 activation and ceramide generation  leading to autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lipofuscin accumulation and autophagy in glaucomatous human lamina cribrosa cells.Disease associated alterations in the phenotype of lamina cribrosa (LC) cells are implicated in changes occurring at the optic nerve head (ONH) in glaucoma. Lipofuscin  the formation of which is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS)  is an intralysosomal  non-degradable  auto-fluorescent macromolecule which accumulates with age and can affect autophagy - the lysosomal degradation of a cell's constituents. We aimed to compare the content of lipofuscin-like material and markers of autophagy in LC cells from normal and glaucoma donor eyes.,Autophagy_notLIR

Mechanisms of changes to the liver pigmentary component during the annual cycle (activity and hibernation) of Rana esculenta L.The present study was performed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the changes of melanin content/ distribution we had previously discovered in the liver parenchyma of Rana esculenta during natural hibernation. Melanomacrophagic component response was analysed using morphocytochemical methods. The results demonstrated that during the prehibernation period (October-November) the melanomacrophages reach the highest proliferative activity (BrdU  PCNA labelling) which is accompanied by an evident melanosynthesis (dopa-oxidase activity). In contrast  after hibernation  the decrease of liver pigmentation was the consequence of a partial cell loss by apoptotic mechanisms (TUNEL labelling  pyknosis-karyorhexis) accompanied by a decrease of melanosome content by autophagy and low melanosynthetic activity. On the basis of these findings  there is evidence that liver melanomacrophages represent a metabolically (melanin synthesis/degradation) and cytokinetically (proliferation/ death) active cell population during the annual cycle of the frog. The results are also discussed in relation to the functional synergism between hepatocytes and pigment cells in the adaptation to environmental changes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of autophagosome formation restores mitochondrial function in mucolipidosis II and III skin fibroblasts.Mucolipidosis II and III are progressive lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficiency of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase  leading to massive accumulation of undigested substrates in lysosomes (inclusion bodies) in skin fibroblast. In this study  we demonstrated accumulation of autolysosomes and increased levels of p62 and ubiquitin proteins in cultured fibroblasts. These autophagic elevations were milder in mucolipidosis III compared with mucolipidosis II. Mitochondrial structure was fragmented and activity was impaired in the affected cells  and 3-methyladenine  an inhibitor of autophagosome formation  restored these.

Bioenergetic analysis of intact mammalian cells using the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux analyzer and a luciferase ATP assay.Metabolic pathways and bioenergetics were described in great detail over half a century ago  and during the past decade there has been a resurgence in integrating these cellular processes with other biological properties of the cell  including growth control  protein kinase cascade signaling  cell cycle division  and autophagy. Since many disease conditions are associated with altered metabolism and production of energy  it is important to develop new approaches to measure these cellular parameters. This chapter summarizes a new and exciting approach based on the Seahorse XF24 Extracelluar Flux analyzer  which takes real time measurements of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in living cells. These bioenergetic profiles are then compared with steady-state levels of cellular ATP as measured by a luciferase assay.,Autophagy_notLIR

PF-4708671  a specific inhibitor of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1  activates Nrf2 by promoting p62-dependent autophagic degradation of Keap1.p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is an important serine/threonine kinase and downstream target of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. PF-4708671 is a specific inhibitor of S6K1  and prevents S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of the S6 protein. PF-4708671 treatment often leads to apoptotic cell death. However  the protective mechanism against PF-4708671-induced cell death has not been elucidated. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) pathway is essential for protecting cells against oxidative stress. p62  an adaptor protein in the autophagic process  enhances Nrf2 activation through the impairment of Keap1 activity. In this study  we showed that PF-4708671 induces autophagic Keap1 degradation-mediated Nrf2 activation in p62-dependent manner. Furthermore  p62-dependent Nrf2 activation plays a crucial role in protecting cells from PF-4708671-mediated apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ethambutol induces impaired autophagic flux and apoptosis in the rat retina.Ethambutol (EMB)  an effective first-line antituberculosis agent  can cause serious visual impairment or irreversible vision loss in a significant number of patients. However  the mechanism underlying this ocular cytotoxicity remains to be elucidated. In this study  we found that there were statistically significant dose- and time-dependent increases in the number of cytoplasmic vacuoles and the level of cell death in EMB-treated RGC-5 cells (retinal ganglion cells). The protein kinase C (PKC)δ inhibitor rottlerin markedly reduced the EMB-induced activation of caspase-3 and the subsequent apoptosis of RGC-5 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of class III PI3K  Beclin-1  p62 and LC3-II were upregulated  and LC3 immunostaining results showed activation of the early phase and inhibition of the late stage of autophagy in retinas of the EMB-intraperitoneal (IP)-injected rat model. We further demonstrated that exposure to EMB induces autophagosome accumulation  which results from the impaired autophagic flux that is mediated by a PKCδ-dependent pathway  inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and leads to apoptotic death in retina neuronal cells. These results indicate that autophagy dysregulation in retinal neuronal cells might play a substantial role in EMB-induced optic neuroretinopathy.,Autophagy_notLIR
δPKC interaction with the d subunit of F1Fo ATP synthase impairs energetics and exacerbates ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts.Previously  we demonstrated protection against hypoxic injury in neonatal cardiac myocytes and reduced release of cardiac troponin I from perfused rat hearts by a novel peptide inhibitor [NH2-YGRKKRRQRRRMLATRALSLIGKRAISTSVCAGRKLALKTIDWVSFDYKDDDDK-] of the delta protein kinase C (δPKC) interaction with the "d" subunit of mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase (dF1Fo). This peptide was developed in our laboratory and contains: an HIV-Tat protein transduction domain; a mitochondrial targeting motif; the δPKC-dF1Fo inhibitor sequence; and a FLAG epitope. In the present study the δPKC-dF1Fo inhibitor attenuated co-immunoprecipitation of δPKC with dF1Fo  improved recovery of contractility  diminished levels of tissue t-carbonyls and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)  and reduced 2 3 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-monitored infarct size following simulated global ischemia/reperfusion (IR) exposures. Perfusion of hearts with this peptide prior to IR enhanced ATP levels 2.1-fold  improved ADP (state 3)- and FCCP (maximal)-stimulated respiration in mitochondrial oxygen consumption assays  and attenuated Ca(++)-induced mitochondrial swelling following ischemic injury. Mitochondrial membrane potential (assessed by JC-1) was also improved 1.6-fold by the inhibitor in hearts subsequently exposed to IR injury. Brief IR exposures did not cause mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. Additionally  the inhibitor did not modify accumulation of the autophagy marker LC3II after brief IR injury. Our results support the potential for this first-in-class peptide as a translational agent for combating cardiac IR injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apoptosis induced by overall metabolic stress converges on the Bcl-2 family proteins Noxa and Mcl-1.Apoptosis provoked by glucose shortage in dividing T cells is mediated via the BH3-only protein Noxa and inhibition of its binding partner Mcl-1. It is unknown how signals from cellular metabolism can affect the balance between Mcl-1 and Noxa and to what extent other Bcl-2 members are involved in this apoptosis cascade. Here  we defined the mechanism underlying apoptosis in relation to various types of metabolic stress. First  we established that the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance is regulated by glucose deprivation as well as by general metabolic stress  via changes in proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1. Second  in contrast with cytokine-deprivation  no transcriptional modulation of Mcl-1  Puma  Bim or Noxa was observed during glucose deprivation. Third  no changes in PKB or GSK3 activity occurred and no clear role for AMPK was detected. Fourth  apoptosis triggered by nutrient deprivation was executed without signs of overt autophagy and independent of ROS production or p38 MAP kinase activity. Lastly  apoptosis under nutrient limitation could also be delayed by knock-down of Bim or overexpression of Bcl-2. In conclusion  Noxa functions in a specific apoptotic pathway that integrates overall nutrient stress  independent from attenuated PI3K/PKB signaling and without clear involvement of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
[PI3 kinases and the control of autophagia].Macroautophagy or autophagy is a degradative pathway terminating in the lysosomal compartment after the formation of a cytoplasmic vacuole that engulfs macromolecules and organelles. The recent discovery of the molecular controls of autophagy that are common to eukaryotic cells from yeast to human suggests that the role of autophagy in cell functioning is far beyond its nonselective degradative capacity. The downregulation of autophagy observed in cancer cells is associated with tumor progression. The regulation of autophagy by signalling pathways overlaps with the control of cell growth  proliferation  cell survival and death. Two of these pathways play an important role in control of autophagy  the class I and III PI3K pathways. Several tumor suppressor genes (PTEN  TSC1 and 2  p53) involved in the class I PI3K mTOR signalling network have been shown to stimulate autophagy. In contrast  the oncoproteins involved in this network (Ras  class I PI3K and Akt) have the opposite effect. These findings  together with the discovery that Beclin 1  which forms a complex with the class III PI3K to initiate autophagy  is a tumor suppressor gene product give credibility of the idea that autophagy is a tumor suppressor mechanism. However  cancer cells sometimes mobilize autophagic capacities in response to various stimuli  suggesting that they can also exploit autophagy for their own benefit.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-Related Deubiquitinating Enzymes Involved in Health and Disease.Autophagy is an evolutionarily-conserved process that delivers diverse cytoplasmic components to the lysosomal compartment for either recycling or degradation. This involves the removal of protein aggregates  the turnover of organelles  as well as the elimination of intracellular pathogens. In this situation  when only specific cargoes should be targeted to the lysosome  the potential targets can be selectively marked by the attachment of ubiquitin in order to be recognized by autophagy-receptors. Ubiquitination plays a central role in this process  because it regulates early signaling events during the induction of autophagy and is also used as a degradation-tag on the potential autophagic cargo protein. Here  we review how the ubiquitin-dependent steps of autophagy are balanced or counteracted by deubiquitination events. Moreover  we highlight the functional role of the corresponding deubiquitinating enzymes and discuss how they might be involved in the occurrence of cancer  neurodegenerative diseases or infection with pathogenic bacteria.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of autophagy by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF216 through BECN1 ubiquitination.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved biological process involved in an array of physiological and pathological events. Without proper control  autophagy contributes to various disorders  including cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It is therefore of vital importance that autophagy is under careful balance. Thus  additional regulators undoubtedly deepen our understanding of the working network  and provide potential therapeutic targets for disorders. In this study  we found that RNF216 (ring finger protein 216)  an E3 ubiquitin ligase  strongly inhibits autophagy in macrophages. Further exploration demonstrates that RNF216 interacts with BECN1  a key regulator in autophagy  and leads to ubiquitination of BECN1  thereby contributing to BECN1 degradation. RNF216 was involved in the ubiquitination of lysine 48 of BECN1 through direct interaction with the triad (2 RING fingers and a DRIL [double RING finger linked]) domain. We further showed that inhibition of autophagy through overexpression of RNF216 in alveolar macrophages promotes Listeria monocytogenes growth and distribution  while knockdown of RNF216 significantly inhibited these outcomes. These effects were confirmed in a mouse model of L. monocytogenes infection  suggesting that manipulating RNF216 expression could be a therapeutic approach. Thus  our study identifies a novel negative regulator of autophagy and suggests that RNF216 may be a target for treatment of inflammatory diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aurora kinase a suppresses metabolic stress-induced autophagic cell death by activating mTOR signaling in breast cancer cells.Aberrant Aur-A signaling is associated with tumor malignant behaviors. However  its involvement in tumor metabolic stress is not fully elucidated. In the present study  prolonged nutrient deprivation was conducted into breast cancer cells to mimic metabolic stress in tumors. In these cells  autophagy was induced  leading to caspase-independent cell death  which was blocked by either targeted knockdown of autophagic gene ATG5 or autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). Aur-A overexpression mediated resistance to autophagic cell death and promoted breast cancer cells survival when exposed to metabolic stress. Moreover  we provided evidence that Aur-A suppressed autophagy in a kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore  we revealed that Aur-A overexpression enhanced the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity under metabolic stress by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin sensitized Aur-A-overexpressed breast cancer cells to metabolic stress-induced cell death. Consistently  we presented an inverse correlation between Aur-A expression (high) and autophagic levels (low) in clinical breast cancer samples. In conclusion  our data provided a novel insight into the cyto-protective role of Aur-A against metabolic stress by suppressing autophagic cell death  which might help to develop alternative cell death avenues for breast cancer therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy genes function in apoptotic cell corpse clearance during C. elegans embryonic development.Efficient apoptotic corpse clearance is essential for metazoan development and adult tissue homeostasis. Several autophagy proteins have been previously shown to function in apoptotic cell clearance; however  it remains unknown whether autophagy genes are essential for efficient apoptotic corpse clearance in the developing embryo. Here we show that  in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos  loss-of-function mutations in several autophagy genes that act at distinct steps in the autophagy pathway resulted in increased numbers of cell corpses and delayed cell corpse clearance. Further analysis of embryos with a null mutation in bec- 1  the C. elegans ortholog of yeast VPS30/ATG6/mammalian beclin 1 (BECN1)  revealed normal phosphatidylserine exposure on dying cells. Moreover  the corpse clearance defects of bec- 1(ok691) embryos were rescued by BEC-1 expression in engulfing cells  and bec- 1(ok691) enhanced corpse clearance defects in nematodes with simultaneous mutations in the engulfment genes  ced- 1  ced- 6 or ced- 12. Together  these data demonstrate that autophagy proteins play an important role in cell corpse clearance during nematode embryonic development  and likely function in parallel to known pathways involved in corpse removal.,Autophagy_notLIR

Neuronal cell death in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in infants and young children. Therapeutic opportunities are very limited for neonatal and pediatric HIE. Specific neural systems and populations of cells are selectively vulnerable in HIE; however  the mechanisms of degeneration are unresolved. These mechanisms involve oxidative stress  excitotoxicity  inflammation  and the activation of several different cell death pathways. Decades ago the structural and mechanistic basis of the cellular degeneration in HIE was thought to be necrosis. Subsequently  largely due to advances in cell biology and to experimental animal studies  emphasis has been switched to apoptosis or autophagy mediated by programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms as important forms of degeneration in HIE. We have conceptualized based on morphological and biochemical data that this degeneration is better classified according to an apoptosis-necrosis cell death continuum and that programmed cell necrosis has prominent contribution in the neurodegeneration of HIE in animal models. It is likely that neonatal HIE evolves through many cell death chreodes influenced by the dynamic injury landscape. The relevant injury mechanisms remain to be determined in human neonatal HIE  though preliminary work suggests a complexity in the cell death mechanisms greater than that anticipated from experimental animal models. The accurate identification of the various cell death chreodes and their mechanisms unfolding within the immature brain matrix could provide fresh insight for developing meaningful therapies for neonatal and pediatric HIE.,Autophagy_notLIR
Discovery of drug mode of action and drug repositioning from transcriptional responses.A bottleneck in drug discovery is the identification of the molecular targets of a compound (mode of action  MoA) and of its off-target effects. Previous approaches to elucidate drug MoA include analysis of chemical structures  transcriptional responses following treatment  and text mining. Methods based on transcriptional responses require the least amount of information and can be quickly applied to new compounds. Available methods are inefficient and are not able to support network pharmacology. We developed an automatic and robust approach that exploits similarity in gene expression profiles following drug treatment  across multiple cell lines and dosages  to predict similarities in drug effect and MoA. We constructed a "drug network" of 1 302 nodes (drugs) and 41 047 edges (indicating similarities between pair of drugs). We applied network theory  partitioning drugs into groups of densely interconnected nodes (i.e.  communities). These communities are significantly enriched for compounds with similar MoA  or acting on the same pathway  and can be used to identify the compound-targeted biological pathways. New compounds can be integrated into the network to predict their therapeutic and off-target effects. Using this network  we correctly predicted the MoA for nine anticancer compounds  and we were able to discover an unreported effect for a well-known drug. We verified an unexpected similarity between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors and Topoisomerase inhibitors. We discovered that Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) might be "repositioned" as an enhancer of cellular autophagy  potentially applicable to several neurodegenerative disorders. Our approach was implemented in a tool (Mode of Action by NeTwoRk Analysis  MANTRA  http://mantra.tigem.it).,Autophagy_notLIR

The expanding role of NLRs in antiviral immunity.Nucleotide oligomerization and binding domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are a major constituent of the cytosolic innate immune-sensing machinery and participate in a wide array of pathways including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  inflammasome  and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. NLRs have known roles in autoimmune  autoinflammatory  and infectious diseases. With respect to virus infection  NLRP3 is the most extensively studied NLR  including mechanisms of activation and inhibition. Furthermore  the importance of NLRP3 in both innate and adaptive immunity has been demonstrated. In comparison to NLRP3  the roles of other NLRs during virus infection are only just emerging. NLRC2 is an important activator of innate antiviral signaling and was recently found to mitigate inflammation during virus infection through autophagy. Finally  functions for NLRX1 in immune modulation and reactive oxygen species production require further examination and the importance of NLRC5 as a transactivator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and antigen presentation is currently developing. In this review  we discuss current knowledge pertaining to viruses and NLRs as well as areas of potential research  which will help advance the study of NLR biology during virus infection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Yet another function of p53--the switch that determines whether radiation-induced autophagy will be cytoprotective or nonprotective: implications for autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.The influence of autophagy inhibition on radiation sensitivity was studied in human breast  head and neck  and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines  in cell lines that were either wild type or mutant/null in p53  and in cells where p53 was inducible or silenced. Whereas ionizing radiation promoted autophagy in all tumor cell lines studied  pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and/or genetic silencing of autophagy genes failed to influence sensitivity to radiation in p53 mutant Hs578t breast tumor cells  HN6 head and neck tumor cells  and H358 non-small cell lung cancer cells. The requirement for functional p53 in the promotion of cytoprotective autophagy by radiation was confirmed by the observation that radiation-induced autophagy was nonprotective in p53 null H1299 cells but was converted to the cytoprotective form with induction of p53. Conversely  whereas p53 wild-type HN30 head and neck cancer cells did show sensitization to radiation upon autophagy inhibition  HN30 cells in which p53 was knocked down using small hairpin RNA failed to be sensitized by pharmacological autophagy inhibition. Taken together  these findings indicate that radiation-induced autophagy can be either cytoprotective or nonprotective  a functional difference related to the presence or absence of function p53. Alternatively  these findings could be interpreted to suggest that whereas radiation can induce autophagy independent of p53 status  inhibition of autophagy promotes enhanced radiation sensitivity through a mechanism that requires functional p53. These observations are likely to have direct implications with respect to clinical efforts to modulate the response of malignancies to radiation through autophagy inhibition.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy  apoptosis and organelle features during cell exposure to cadmium.Cadmium (Cd) induces several effects in different tissues  but our knowledge of the toxic effects on organelles is insufficient. To observe the progression of Cd effects on organelle structure and function  HuH-7 cells (human hepatic carcinoma cell line) were exposed to CdCl2 in increasing concentrations (1 microM - 20 microM) and exposure times (2 h - 24 h). During Cd treatment  the cells exhibited a progressive decrease in viability that was both time- and dose-dependent. Cd treated cells displayed progressive morphological changes that included cytoplasm retraction and nuclear condensation preceding a total loss of cell adhesion. Treatment with 10 microM for 12 h led to irreversible damages. Before these drastic and irreparable damages  treated cells (5 microM for 12 h) presented a progressive loss of mitochondrial function and cytoplasm acidification as well as dysfunction and disorganization of microfilaments and endoplasmic reticulum. These damages led to the induction of apoptotic events and an increase in autophagic bodies in the cytoplasm. These results revealed that Cd affects multiple intra-cellular targets that induce alterations in the mitochondria  cytoskeleton  endoplasmic reticulum and acidic compartments  ultimately culminating in cell death via apoptotic and autophagic pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oncogene-induced senescence: the bright and dark side of the response.In late 1990s  it was shown that activated oncogenes are able to induce senescence. Since then large leaps in understanding this phenomenon have been achieved. There is substantial evidence supporting oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) as a potent antitumor barrier in vivo. Multiple pathways participating in cell cycle regulation  DNA damage signaling  immune response  and bioenergetics regulate the process. Despite its beneficial effects the senescent cell is thought to promote carcinogenesis and age-related disease in a nonautonomous manner. Here  we highlight the works dealing with all these aspects and discuss the studies proposing therapeutic exploitation of OIS.,Autophagy_notLIR
[mTOR  the mammalian target of rapamycin].The discovery of rapamycin from a soil sample on Easter Island in the mid 60's marked the beginning of an exciting field of research in cell biology and medicine. While it was first used as an antifungal and as an immunosuppressive drug  more recent studies confirmed rapamycin's antiproliferative properties over a variety of solid tumors. Research aimed at identifying its mechanism of action uncovered mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)  a protein kinase that regulates mRNA translation and protein synthesis  an essential step in cell division and proliferation. Recent evidence suggests a more complex role for mTOR in the regulation of several growth factor-stimulated protein kinases  including the proto-oncogene Akt. This article reviews mTOR function and regulation  and briefly details the future challenges for anti-cancer therapies based on mTOR inhibition.,Autophagy_notLIR
Valproic acid reduces autophagy and promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats.Secondary damage is a critical determinant of the functional outcome in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI)  and involves multiple mechanisms of which the most important is the loss of nerve cells mediated by multiple factors. Autophagy can result in cell death  and plays a key role in the development of SCI. It has been recognized that valproic acid (VPA) is neuroprotective in certain experimental animal models  however  the levels of autophagic changes in the process of neuroprotection by VPA treatment following SCI are still unknown. In the present study  we determined the extent of autophagy after VPA treatment in a rat model of SCI. We found that both the mRNA and protein levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 were significantly increased at 1  2  and 6 h after SCI and peaked at 2 h; however  Western blot showed that autophagy was markedly decreased by VPA treatment at 2 h post-injury. Besides  post-SCI treatment with VPA improved the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale  increased the number of ventral horn motoneurons  and reduced myelin sheath damage compared with vehicle-treated animals at 42 days after SCI. Together  our results demonstrated the characteristics of autophagy expression following SCI  and found that VPA reduced autophagy and enhanced motor function.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of autophagy-lysosome pathway in neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease.The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) are the two most important mechanisms that normally repair or remove abnormal proteins. Alterations in the function of these systems to degrade misfolded and aggregated proteins are being increasingly recognized as playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Dysfunction of the UPS has been already strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease and  more recently  growing interest has been shown in identifying the role of ALP in neurodegeneration. Mutations of alpha-synuclein and the increase of intracellular concentrations of non-mutant alpha-synuclein have been associated with Parkinson's disease phenotype. The demonstration that alpha-synuclein is degraded by both proteasome and autophagy indicates a possible linkage between the dysfunction of the UPS or ALP and the occurrence of this disorder. The fact that mutant alpha-synucleins inhibit ALP functioning by tightly binding to the receptor on the lysosomal membrane for autophagy pathway further supports the assumption that impairment of the ALP may be related to the development of Parkinson's disease. In this review  we summarize the recent findings related to this topic and discuss the unique role of the ALP in this neurogenerative disorder and the putative therapeutic potential through ALP enhancement.,Autophagy_notLIR
Variations in the effects on synthesis of amyloid beta protein in modulated autophagic conditions.Autophagy  the intracellular breakdown system for proteins and some organelles  is considered to be important in neurodegenerative disease. Recent reports suggest that autophagy plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and autophagic vacuoles (AVs) may be sites of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) generation. We attempted to determine if imposed changes in autophagic activity are linked to Abeta generation and secretion in cultured cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Comparison of the structure  function and autophagic maintenance of mitochondria in nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons.A pathological hallmark of Parkinson׳s disease (PD) is progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (NSDA) neurons  which underlies the motor symptoms of PD. While there is severe loss of midbrain NSDA neurons  tuberoinfundibular (TI) DA neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) remain intact. In the present study  confocal microscopic analysis revealed that mitochondrial content and numbers of mitophagosomes were lower in NSDA neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) compared to TIDA neuronal cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of C57BL/6J male mice. Mitochondrial respiration  mass  membrane potential and morphology were determined using bioenergetic  flow cytometric and transmission electron microscopic analyses of synaptosomes isolated from discrete brain regions containing axon terminals of NSDA and TIDA neurons. Maximum and spare respiratory capacities  and mitochondrial mass were lower in synaptosomal mitochondria derived from the striatum (ST) as compared with the MBH  which correlated with lower numbers of mitochondria per synaptosome in these brain regions. In contrast  there was no regional difference in mitochondrial basal  maximum or spare respirations following inhibition of Complex I activity with rotenone. These results reveal that higher numbers of viable mitochondria are correlated with more extensive autophagic mitochondrial quality maintenance in TIDA neurons as compared with NSDA neurons.,Autophagy_notLIR
The E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM50 interacts with HDAC6 and p62  and promotes the sequestration and clearance of ubiquitinated proteins into the aggresome.In this study we report that  in response to proteasome inhibition  the E3-Ubiquitin ligase TRIM50 localizes to and promotes the recruitment and aggregation of polyubiquitinated proteins to the aggresome. Using Hdac6-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) we show that this localization is mediated by the histone deacetylase 6  HDAC6. Whereas Trim50-deficient MEFs allow pinpointing that the TRIM50 ubiquitin-ligase regulates the clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins localized to the aggresome. Finally we demonstrate that TRIM50 colocalizes  interacts with and increases the level of p62  a multifunctional adaptor protein implicated in various cellular processes including the autophagy clearance of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. We speculate that when the proteasome activity is impaired  TRIM50 fails to drive its substrates to the proteasome-mediated degradation  and promotes their storage in the aggresome for successive clearance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Asparagine deprivation mediated by Salmonella asparaginase causes suppression of activation-induced T cell metabolic reprogramming.Salmonellae are pathogenic bacteria that induce immunosuppression by mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Previously  we showed that a putative type II l-asparaginase produced by Salmonella Typhimurium inhibits T cell responses and mediates virulence in a murine model of infection. Here  we report that this putative L-asparaginase exhibits L-asparagine hydrolase activity required for Salmonella Typhimurium to inhibit T cells. We show that L-asparagine is a nutrient important for T cell activation and that L-asparagine deprivation  such as that mediated by the Salmonella Typhimurium L-asparaginase  causes suppression of activation-induced mammalian target of rapamycin signaling  autophagy  Myc expression  and L-lactate secretion. We also show that L-asparagine deprivation mediated by the Salmonella Typhimurium L-asparaginase causes suppression of cellular processes and pathways involved in protein synthesis  metabolism  and immune response. Our results advance knowledge of a mechanism used by Salmonella Typhimurium to inhibit T cell responses and mediate virulence  and provide new insights into the prerequisites of T cell activation. We propose a model in which l-asparagine deprivation inhibits T cell exit from quiescence by causing suppression of activation-induced metabolic reprogramming.,Autophagy_notLIR
Involvement of apoptosis and autophagy in reducing mouse hepatoma ML-1 cell growth in inbred BALB/c mice by bacterial fermented soybean products.Followed by the results of our previous in vitro report (Food Chem. Toxicol.  2007)  the efficacy of the soybean fermentation products containing live bacteria (SCB) was demonstrated using a syngeneic animal model. Murine HBV-related hepatoma ML-1 cells  derived from inbred animals and tumorigenic in BALB/c mice  were implanted subcutaneously to the flank of BALB/c mice on day 0. Three days after implantation  SCB (1.0 or 1.3 ml/mouse/day) or vehicle (water) was orally administrated daily until day 60. The results indicate that SCB significantly reduced (P<0.05) the volumes and weights of tumors during the experimental periods. Examination using TUNEL staining on section of tumors revealed apoptotic phenomenon of nuclear DNA double-strand breaks in the groups of mice received SCB. Immunohistochemistry further revealed an autophagic LC3-II punctate pattern. Of note  SCB induced autophagy in the absence or presence of apoptosis  whereas  apoptosis was observed only in combination with autophagy. In vitro study using autophagy inhibitor indicated that the induction of autophagy promoted apoptosis. These data imply that the suppression in tumor volumes and tumor weights by oral administration of SCB was due to the induction of apoptotic and autophagic cell death  which suggests therapeutic potential of SCB on HBV-related HCC.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy is dispensable for B-cell development but essential for humoral autoimmune responses.To gain new insight into the role of B-cell autophagy  we generated two novel mouse models deficient for the autophagy-related gene (Atg)5  one from the outset pro-B cell stage (Atg5(f/-) Mb1 cre) and the other in mature B cells only (Atg5(f/-) CD21 cre). We show that autophagy is dispensable for pro- to pre-B cell transition  but necessary at a basal level to maintain normal numbers of peripheral B cells. It appears non-essential for B-cell activation under B-cell receptor stimulation but required for their survival after lipopolysaccharide stimulation that drives plasmablast differentiation and for specific IgM production after immunization. Results obtained using Atg5(f/-) CD21 cre × C57BL/6(lpr/lpr) autoimmune-prone mice show that B-cell autophagy is involved in the maintenance of anti-nuclear antibody secretion  elevated number of long-lived plasma cells  and sustains IgG deposits in the kidneys. Thus  treatments specifically targeting autophagy might be beneficial in systemic autoimmune diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR

Subversion of cellular autophagy by Anaplasma phagocytophilum.Anaplasma phagocytophilum  the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis  is an obligatory intracellular pathogen. After entry into host cells  the bacterium is diverted from the endosomal pathway and replicates in a membrane-bound compartment devoid of endosomal or lysosomal markers. Here  we show that several hallmarks of early autophagosomes can be identified in A. phagocytophilum replicative inclusions  including a double-lipid bilayer membrane and colocalization with GFP-tagged LC3 and Beclin 1  the human homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae autophagy-related proteins Atg8 and Atg6 respectively. While the membrane-associated form of LC3  LC3-II  increased during A. phagocytophilum infection  A. phagocytophilum-containing inclusions enveloped with punctate GFP-LC3 did not colocalize with a lysosomal marker. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin favoured A. phagocytophilum infection. Inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine did not inhibit A. phagocytophilum internalization  but reversibly arrested its growth. Although autophagy is considered part of the innate immune system that clears a variety of intracellular pathogens  our study implies that A. phagocytophilum subverts this system to establish itself in an early autophagosome-like compartment segregated from lysosomes to facilitate its proliferation.,Autophagy_notLIR

Foot-and-mouth disease virus nonstructural protein 2C interacts with Beclin1  modulating virus replication.Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)  the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease  is an Apthovirus within the Picornaviridae family. Replication of the virus occurs in association with replication complexes that are formed by host cell membrane rearrangements. The largest viral protein in the replication complex  2C  is thought to have multiple roles during virus replication. However  studies examining the function of FMDV 2C have been rather limited. To better understand the role of 2C in the process of virus replication  we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify host proteins that interact with 2C. We report here that cellular Beclin1 is a specific host binding partner for 2C. Beclin1 is a regulator of the autophagy pathway  a metabolic pathway required for efficient FMDV replication. The 2C-Beclin1 interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy to actually occur in FMDV-infected cells. Overexpression of either Beclin1 or Bcl-2  another important autophagy factor  strongly affects virus yield in cell culture. The fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes containing viral proteins is not seen during FMDV infection  a process that is stimulated by Beclin1; however  in FMDV-infected cells overexpressing Beclin1 this fusion occurs  suggesting that 2C would bind to Beclin1 to prevent the fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes  allowing for virus survival. Using reverse genetics  we demonstrate here that modifications to the amino acids in 2C that are critical for interaction with Beclin1 are also critical for virus growth. These results suggest that interaction between FMDV 2C and host protein Beclin1 could be essential for virus replication.,Autophagy_notLIR
Temsirolimus attenuates tauopathy in vitro and in vivo by targeting tau hyperphosphorylation and autophagic clearance.In a variety of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease  frontotemporal dementia and some types of Parkinson's disease  tau protein is abnormally hyperphosphorylated by several kinases and eventually aggregates to form neurofibrillary tangles  a neurotoxic pathological characteristic that closely correlates with cognitive impairments. Hence  targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein has now been considered as a valid therapeutic approach for these neurodegenerative tauopathies. As a newly developed analog of rapamycin  temsirolimus was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Recent findings suggested that temsirolimus also provided beneficial effects in animal models of Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3  two neurodegenerative diseases caused by accumulation of aberrant proteins within brain. To date  the therapeutic potentials of temsirolimus in neurodegenerative tauopathies have not been determined. Herein  we demonstrated for the first time that temsirolimus treatment effectively enhanced autophagic clearance of hyperphosphorylated tau in okadaic acid-incubated SH-SY5Y cells and in brain of P301S transgenic mice. Meanwhile  we showed that inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β  the most important tau kinase  might contribute to the temsirolimus-induced reduction of tau hyperphosphorylation in these two tauopathy models. More importantly  temsirolimus administration rescued spatial learning and memory impairments in P301S transgenic mice. These findings highlight temsirolimus administration as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative tauopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and its normal and pathogenic states in the brain.Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that delivers the cytosol and cytosolic constituents to the lysosome. Its fundamental role is to maintain cellular homeostasis and to protect cells from varying insults  including misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. Beyond these roles  the highly specialized cells of the brain have further adapted autophagic pathways to suit their distinct needs. In this review  we briefly summarize our current understanding of the different forms of autophagy and then offer a closer look at how these pathways impact neuronal and glial functions. The emerging evidence indicates that not only are autophagy pathways essential for neural health  but they have a direct impact on developmental and neurodegenerative processes. Taken together  as we unravel the complex roles autophagy pathways play  we will gain the necessary insight to modify these pathways to protect the human brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
The control of the balance between ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinase: oxidative stress and the seesaw of cell survival and death.Sphingolipids are components of all eukaryotic cells that play important roles in a wide variety of biological processes. Ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are signaling molecules that regulate cell fate decisions in a wide array of species including yeast  plants  vertebrates  and invertebrates. Ceramides favor anti-proliferative and cell death pathways such as senescence and apoptosis  whereas S1P stimulates cell proliferation and survival pathways. The control of cell fate by these two interconvertible lipids has been called the sphingolipid rheostat or sphingolipid biostat. Sphingosine kinase  the enzyme that synthesizes S1P  is a crucial enzyme in regulation of the balance of these sphingolipids. Sphingosine kinase has been shown to play dynamic roles in the responses of cells to stress  leading to modulation of cell fate through a variety of signaling pathways impinging on the processes of cell proliferation  apoptosis  autophagy and senescence. This review summarizes the roles of sphingosine kinase signaling in these processes and the mechanisms mediating these responses. In addition  we discuss the evidence tying sphingosine kinase-mediated stress responses to the process of aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Analysis of autophagy during infections of Cryptococcus neoformans.Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeastlike fungus that causes a lethal meningoencephalitis in a broad spectrum of immunocompromised patients and has become the most common cause of meningitis due to AIDS-related infections in Africa. Key to the development of new agents to control and prevent this infection is the identification of cellular mechanisms required for pathogenesis. Survival of the fungus within the hostile and nutrient-deprived environments of the host has recently been shown to depend on the induction of autophagy  whereby the cell recycles nutrients by slowly digesting itself in a regulated fashion. Further study of the role of autophagy during infection by C. neoformans requires the use of markers of autophagy that are specially adapted to the fungus within the mammalian host.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) in the degradation of misfolded N-CoR protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.Nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) plays important role in transcriptional control mediated by several tumor suppressor proteins. Recently  we reported a role of misfolded-conformation dependent loss (MCDL) of N-CoR in the activation of oncogenic survival pathway in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Since N-CoR plays important role in cellular homeostasis in various tissues  therefore  we hypothesized that an APL like MCDL of N-CoR might also be involved in other malignancy. Indeed  our initial screening of N-CoR status in various leukemia and solid tumor cells revealed an APL like MCDL of N-CoR in primary and secondary tumor cells derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The NSCLC cell specific N-CoR loss could be blocked by Kaletra  a clinical grade protease inhibitor and by genistein  an inhibitor of N-CoR misfolding previously characterized by us. The misfolded N-CoR presented in NSCLC cells was linked to the amplification of ER stress and was subjected to degradation by NSCLC cell specific aberrant protease activity. In NSCLC cells  misfolded N-CoR was found to be associated with Hsc70  a molecular chaperone involved in chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA). Genetic and chemical inhibition of Lamp2A  a rate limiting factor of CMA  significantly blocked the loss of N-CoR in NSCLC cells  suggesting a crucial role of CMA in N-CoR degradation. These findings identify an important role of CMA-induced degradation of misfolded N-CoR in the neutralization of ER stress and suggest a possible role of misfolded N-CoR protein in the activation of oncogenic survival pathway in NSCLC cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cvt19 is a receptor for the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway.Cvt19 is specifically required for the transport of resident vacuolar hydrolases that utilize the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Autophagy (Apg) and pexophagy  processes that use the majority of the same protein components as the Cvt pathway  do not require Cvt19. Cvt19GFP is localized to punctate structures on or near the vacuole surface. Cvt19 is a peripheral membrane protein that binds to the precursor form of the Cvt cargo protein aminopeptidase I (prAPI) and travels to the vacuole with prAPI. These results suggest that Cvt19 is a receptor protein for prAPI that allows for the selective transport of this protein by both the Cvt and Apg pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR

Reticulon 3 attenuates the clearance of cytosolic prion aggregates via inhibiting autophagy.Autophagy plays an important role in targeting cellular proteins  protein aggregates and organelles for degradation for cell survival. Autophagy dysfunction has been extensively described in neurodegenerative conditions linked to protein misfolding and aggregation. However  the role of autophagy in the prion disease process is unclear. Here  we show that when expressed in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells  cytoplasmic PrP (cyPrP) aggregates lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)  activation of reticulon 3 (RTN3)  impairment of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)  induction of autophagy and apoptosis. RTN3 belongs to the reticulon family with the highest expression in the brain and RTN3 is often activated under ER stress. To assess the function of RTN3 in pathological conditions involving cyPrP protein misfolding  we knocked down the expression of RTN3 in cyPrP-transfected cells; unexpectedly  the inhibition of expression of RTN3 enhances the induction of autophagy resulted from cyPrP aggregates  and the process is mediated by the enhanced interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin1 promoted by RTN3  which enhances Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of Beclin 1-dependent autophagy. Furthermore  down-regulation of RTN3 promoted the clearance of cyPrP aggregates  allowed the activity of the UPS to resume and alleviated ER stress; ultimately  apoptosis due to the cyPrP aggregates was inhibited. Together  these data suggest that RTN3 negatively regulates autophagy to block the clearance of cyPrP aggregates and provide a clue regarding the potential to induce autophagy for the treatment of prion disease and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD)  Alzheimer disease (AD) and Huntington disease (HD).,Autophagy_notLIR
Analysis of protein expression changes of the Vero E6 cells infected with classic PEDV strain CV777 by using quantitative proteomic technique.Recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused widespread concern. The identification of proteins associated with PEDV infection might provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis and facilitate the development of novel antiviral strategies. We analyzed the differential protein profile of PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells using mass spectrometry and an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification. A total of 126 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed between the PEDV-infected and mock-infected groups (P<0.05  quantitative ratio ≥1.2)  among which the expression of 58 proteins was up-regulated and that of 68 proteins was down-regulated in the PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells  involving in integrin β2/β3  cystatin-C. The Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the molecular function of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was primarily related to binding and catalytic activity  and that the biological functions in which the DEPs are involved included metabolism  organismal systems  cellular processes  genetic information processing  environmental information processing  and diseases. Among the disease-related functions  certain anti-viral pathways and proteins  such as the RIG-I-like receptor  Rap1  autophagy  mitogen-activated protein kinase  PI3K-Akt and Jak-STAT signaling pathways  and integrin β2/β3 and cystatin-C proteins  represented potential factors in PEDV infection. Our findings provide valuable insight into PEDV-Vero E6 cell interactions.,Autophagy_notLIR
A conceptual framework: the early and late phases of skeletal muscle dysfunction in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often develop severe diaphragmatic and limb skeletal muscle dysfunction. Impaired muscle function in ARDS is associated with increased mortality  increased duration of mechanical ventilation  and functional disability in survivors. In this review  we propose that muscle dysfunction in ARDS can be categorized into an early and a late phase. These early and late phases are based on the timing in relationship to lung injury and the underlying mechanisms. The early phase occurs temporally with the onset of lung injury  is driven by inflammation and disuse  and is marked predominantly by muscle atrophy from increased protein degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome  autophagy  and calpain-caspase pathways have all been implicated in early-phase muscle dysfunction. Late-phase muscle weakness persists in many patients despite resolution of lung injury and cessation of ongoing acute inflammation-driven muscle atrophy. The clinical characteristics and mechanisms underlying late-phase muscle dysfunction do not involve the massive protein degradation and atrophy of the early phase and may reflect a failure of the musculoskeletal system to regain homeostatic balance. Owing to these underlying mechanistic differences  therapeutic interventions for treating muscle dysfunction in ARDS may differ during the early and late phases. Here  we review clinical and translational investigations of muscle dysfunction in ARDS  placing them in the conceptual framework of the early and late phases. We hypothesize that this conceptual model will aid in the design of future mechanistic and clinical investigations of the skeletal muscle system in ARDS and other critical illnesses.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy: An Integral Component of the Mammalian Stress Response.Mammalian cells and tissues respond to chemical and physical stress by inducing adaptive or protective mechanisms that prolong survival. Among these  the major stress inducible proteins (heat shock proteins  glucose regulated proteins  heme oxygenase-1) provide cellular protection through protein chaperone and/or anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions. In recent years it has become clear that autophagy  a genetically-programmed and evolutionarily-conserved cellular process represents another adaptive response to cellular stress. During autophagy cytosolic material  including organelles  proteins  and foreign pathogens  are sequestered into membrane-bound vesicles termed autophagosomes  and then delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Through recycling of cellular biochemicals  autophagy provides a mechanism for adaptation to starvation. Recent research has uncovered selective autophagic pathways that target distinct cargoes to autophagosomes  including mechanisms for the clearance of aggregated protein  and for the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy). Autophagy can be induced by multiple forms of chemical and physical stress  including endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress  and plays an integral role in the mammalian stress response. Understanding of the interaction and co-regulation of autophagy with other stress-inducible systems will be useful in the design and implementation of therapeutics targeting this pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Focusing at the double-edged sword of redox imbalance: signals for cell survival or for cell death?Redox signaling plays a fundamental role in tissue physiological metabolism. A fine balance between reactive oxidizing species (ROS) generation and antioxidant levels allows either the cross talk between cells or the control of fundamental intracellular functions  such as cell-cell interactions  cell division  migration  and contraction. A deregulation of this balance  for example  leading to oxidative stress  has been implicated in many pathological conditions  including cardiovascular-  neuronal-  and immunological-related diseases  as well as in cancer. A key role of ROS generation has also been associated with a variety of cell death processes  including necrosis  apoptosis  and autophagy. More recently  the discovery that autophagy  formerly considered as a cell death program  mainly represents an important cytoprotection mechanism  led to a series of studies aimed at the comprehension of the role of ROS generation in regulating intracellular signals leading to the activation of survival mechanisms or triggering cell death. However  different cell types  for example  neuronal cells  muscle cells  lymphocytes  or epithelial cells  seem to display different redox sensitivities  different signaling pathways  and different defense mechanisms. In few words  as illustrated in detail in the present Forum  the future challenge on this matter will be represented by the comprehension of the histotype-associated or histotype-dependent intracellular mechanisms of ROS management.,Autophagy_notLIR
Manipulation or capitulation: virus interactions with autophagy.Autophagy is a homeostatic process that functions to balance cellular metabolism and promote cell survival during stressful conditions by delivering cytoplasmic components for lysosomal degradation and subsequent recycling. During viral infection  autophagy can act as a surveillance mechanism that delivers viral antigens to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments that are enriched in immune sensors. Additionally  activated immune sensors can signal to activate autophagy. To evade this antiviral activity  many viruses elaborate functions to block the autophagy pathway at a variety of steps. Alternatively  some viruses actively subvert autophagy for their own benefit. Manipulated autophagy has been proposed to facilitate nearly every stage of the viral lifecycle in direct and indirect ways. In this review  we synthesize the extensive literature on virus-autophagy interactions  emphasizing the role of autophagy in antiviral immunity and the mechanisms by which viruses subvert autophagy for their own benefit.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy regulation by miRNAs: when cleaning goes out of service.EMBO J 30 22  4628–4641 (2011); published online September 13 2011 Autophagy is a degradation pathway  recycling cell components in a number of basal and sublethal stress conditions. The formation of specific vesicles (autophagosomes)  carrying their content to the lysosome  is primed by several post-translational molecular events  including protein modification and translocation to the ER or other autophagy start sites. However  less is known about autophagy transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. In particular  the microRNA (miRNA) world  which plays crucial roles in development  signalling and stress response in eukaryotes  has not yet been directly linked to autophagy. A paper in this issue of <i>The EMBO Journal</i> reveals an <i>miR-101</i>-specific downregulation of <i>STMN1</i>  <i>RAB5A</i> and <i>ATG4D</i> genes  leading to an efficient decrease of autophagy. By this inhibition  <i>miR-101</i> sensitizes resistant breast cancer cells to death. Thus  this work provides an exceptional insight into different novel levels of autophagy regulation and emphasizes the role that miRNAs can play in biomedicine.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transcription factor co-expression patterns indicate heterogeneity of oligodendroglial subpopulations in adult spinal cord.Oligodendrocytes and their precursors serve critical roles in the maintenance of neurological function. Although activity of the transcription factors (TFs) Olig1  Olig2  Sox10  and Nkx2.2 is required during early oligodendrocyte development  their later expression in adult central nervous system is rather poorly characterized. Here we have analyzed co-expression patterns of these transcriptional proteins in the mouse cervical spinal cord. Our findings indicate that TF co-expression patterns describe heterogeneity in adult oligodendroglial populations (1) in distinct sub-regions of grey and white matter and (2) with respect to level of maturation from proliferating precursors to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Our findings suggest that TF co-expression patterns identify and might regulate distinct functional classes of grey and white matter oligodendroglia.,Autophagy_notLIR
Gone fission…: diverse consequences of cardiac Drp1 deficiency.Mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins are highly expressed in myocardium. However  mitochondrial fission and fusion are rare  and mitochondrial networks are absent  in adult cardiomyocytes  obviating a need for morphometric mitochondrial remodeling. The critical role of mitochondrial dynamics factors in hearts therefore remains to be determined. In this issue of <i>Circulation Research</i> Ikeda et al describe a central function for the mitochondrial fission protein  Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1)  in macroautophagy and mitochondrial autophagy. Together with two other recent reports that cardiac-specific deletion of Drp1 perturbs mitophagy  these findings point to modulation of targeted mitochondrial elimination as a major quality control function for Drp1  and possible other mitochondrial dynamism factors  in the heart.,Autophagy_notLIR
Potential subversion of autophagosomal pathway by picornaviruses.The RNA replication complexes of small positive-strand RNA viruses such as poliovirus are known to form on the surfaces of membranous vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected mammalian cells. These membranes resemble cellular autophagosomes in their double-membraned morphology  cytoplasmic lumen  lipid-rich composition and the presence of cellular proteins LAMP 1 and LC3. Furthermore  LC3 protein is covalently modified during poliovirus infection in a manner indistinguishable from that observed during bona fide autophagy. This covalent modification can also be induced by the expression of viral protein 2BC in isolation. However  differences between poliovirus-induced vesicles and autophagosomes also exist: the viral-induced membranes are smaller  at 200-400 nm in diameter  and can be induced by the combination of two viral proteins  termed 2BC and 3A. Experimental suppression of expression of proteins in the autophagy pathway was found to reduce viral yield  arguing that this pathway facilitates viral infection  rather than clearing it. We have hypothesized that  in addition to providing membranous surfaces for assembly of viral RNA replication complexes  double-membraned vesicles provide a topological mechanism to deliver cytoplasmic contents  including mature virus  to the extracellular milieu without lysing the cell.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cytotoxicity of goniothalamin enantiomers in renal cancer cells: involvement of nitric oxide  apoptosis and autophagy.Goniothalamin is a styryllactone synthesized by plants of the genus Goniothalamus. The biological activities of this molecule  particularly its anti-protozoan  anti-fungal  and larvicidal properties  have received considerable attention. In this work  we investigated the action of the natural and synthetic enantiomers (R)-goniothalamin (1) and (S)-goniothalamin (ent-1) on cell viability  nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and activity  and the expression of selected proteins involved in apoptosis and autophagy in renal cancer cells. Both compounds were cytotoxic and decreased the mitochondrial function of renal cancer cells. However  the enantiomers differentially affected the expression/activity profiles of some signaling pathway mediators. Ent-1 (4 nM) was more potent than 1 (6.4 microM) in inhibiting constitutive NOS activity (54% and 59% inhibition  respectively)  and both enantiomers decreased the protein expression of neuronal and endothelial NOS  as assessed by western blotting. Ent-1 and 1 caused down-regulation of Ras and TNFR1 and inhibition of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Compound 1 markedly down-regulated Bcl2  an anti-apoptotic protein  and also induced PARP cleavage. Despite inducing an expressive down-regulation of Bax  ent-1 was also able to induce PARP cleavage. These results suggest that these compounds caused apoptosis in renal cancer cells. Interestingly  ent-1 enhanced the expression of LC3  a typical marker of autophagy. NFkappaB was down-regulated in 1-treated cells. Overall  these results indicate that the anti-proliferative activity of the two enantiomers on renal cancer cells involved distinct signaling pathways  apoptosis and autophagy as dominant responses towards 1 and ent-1  respectively.,Autophagy_notLIR
Vacuole membrane protein 1  autophagy and much more.Vacuole membrane protein 1 (Vmp1) is a putative transmembrane protein that has been associated with different functions including autophagy  cell adhesion  and membrane traffic. Highly similar proteins are present in lower eukaryotes and plants although a homologue is absent in the fungi lineage. We have recently described the first loss-of-function mutation for a Vmp1 homologue in a model system  Dictyostelium discoideum. Our results give a more comprehensive view of the intricate roles played by this new gene. Dictyostelium Vmp1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. Cells deficient in Vmp1 display pleiotropic defects in the context of the secretory pathway such as organelle biogenesis  the endocytic pathway  and protein secretion. The biogenesis of the contractile vacuole  an organelle necessary to survive under hypoosmotic conditions  is compromised as well as the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Transmission electron microscopy also shows abnormal accumulation of aberrant double-membrane vesicles  suggesting a defect in autophagosome biogenesis or maturation. The expression of a mammalian Vmp1 in the Dictyostelium mutant complements the phenotype suggesting a functional conservation during evolution. We are taking the first steps in understanding the function of this fascinating protein and recent studies have brought us more questions than answers about its basic function and its role in human pathology.,Autophagy_notLIR
Multiple pathways counteract cell death induced by RB1 loss: implications for cancer.Inactivation of the tumor suppressor RB1 leads to cell proliferation  cell death and abortive differentiation in certain tissues and physiological contexts. Anti-apoptotic signals are thought to be the most important mechanism by which RB1-mutant cells escape cell death. Indeed  in the course of neoplastic transformation RB1 is often inactivated in conjunction with a mutation in the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor p53. We have previously devised a biological framework to identify factors that maintain survival of differentiating Rb-deficient muscle fibers. We showed that differentiating Rb-deficient myoblasts fuse to form short myotubes that degenerate in a process associated with enhanced autophagy  and that degeneration was rescued by antagonists of apoptosis or autophagy  induction of mitochondrial-biogenesis or hypoxia-induced glycolytic shift  leading to long  twitching myotubes. Here  we also show that lithium slows the collapse of Rb-deficient myotubes and surprisingly  this is independent of autophagy  cyclin D3 and β-catenin. Thus  several distinct processes can suppress cell death induced by RB1 loss. We discuss these pathways and how they may cooperate with RB1 inactivation in the course of cancer initiation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Positive or negative roles of different cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85-cyclin complexes orchestrate induction of autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.As a major intracellular degradation pathway  autophagy is tightly regulated to prevent cellular dysfunction in all eukaryotic cells. The rapamycin-sensitive Tor kinase complex 1 is a major regulator of autophagy. Several other nutrient-sensory kinases also play critical roles to precisely modulate autophagy; however  the network of regulatory mechanisms remains largely elusive. We used genetic analyses to elucidate the mechanism by which the stress-responsive  cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85 and its corresponding cyclin complexes antagonistically modulate autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When complexed with cyclins Pho80 and Pcl5  Pho85 negatively regulates autophagy through downregulating the protein kinase Rim15 and the transcription factors Pho4 and Gcn4. The cyclins Clg1  Pcl1  and Pho80  in concert with Pho85  positively regulate autophagy through promoting the degradation of Sic1  a negative regulator of autophagy that targets Rim15. Our results suggest a model in which Pho85 and its cyclin complexes have opposing roles in autophagy regulation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification of glucose-6-phosphate transporter as a key regulator functioning at the autophagy initiation step.Autophagy is a catabolic process involving autophagosome formation via lysosome. However  the initiation step of autophagy is largely unknown. We found an interaction between ULK1 and ATG9 in mammalian cells and utilized the interaction to identify novel regulators of autophagy upstream of ULK1. We established a cell-based screening assay employing bimolecular fluorescence complementation. By performing gain-of-function screening  we identified G6PT as an autophagy activator. G6PT enhanced the interaction between N-terminal Venus-tagged ULK1 and C-terminal Venus-tagged ATG9  and increased autophagic flux independent of its transport activity. G6PT negatively regulated mTORC1 activity  demonstrating that G6PT functions upstream of mTORC1 in stimulating autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bone and the innate immune system.The immune system and bone are intimately linked with significant physical and functionally related interactions. The innate immune system functions as an immediate response system to initiate protections against local challenges such as pathogens and cellular damage. Bone is a very specific microenvironment  in which infectious attack is less common but repair and regeneration are ongoing and important functions. Thus  in the bone the primary goal of innate immune and bone interactions is to maintain tissue integrity. Innate immune signals are critical for removal of damaged and apoptotic cells and to stimulate normal tissue repair and regeneration. In this review we focus on the innate immune mechanisms that function to regulate bone homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
A Method to Monitor Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization by Immunocytochemistry.Programmed cell death involving lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) is a common phenomenon--more the rule than the exception under various cytotoxic stimuli and stressful cellular conditions. The protocol presented here is based on immunocytochemical staining of cathepsin B or L to visualize translocation from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. In healthy cells  cathepsins appear in localized punctate structures representing intact lysosomes  whereas LMP results in a diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm. LMP can be triggered upstream  downstream  or independently of the classical apoptotic death pathway involving mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Co-staining with antibodies recognizing the active form of Bax allows investigation of the order of events between LMP and MOMP in death signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Do antioxidants inhibit oxidative-stress-induced autophagy of tenofibroblasts?Recent research on tendinopathy has focused on its relationship to programmed cell death. Increased autophagy has been observed in ruptured rotator cuff tendon tissues  suggesting a causal relationship. We investigated whether autophagy occurs in human rotator cuff tenofibroblast death induced by oxidative stress and whether antioxidants protect against autophagic cell death. We used H2 O2 (0.75 mM) as oxidative stressor  cyanidin (100 µg/ml) as antioxidant  zVAD (20 µM) as apoptosis inhibitor  and 3-MA (10 mM) as autophagy inhibitor. We evaluated cell viability and known autophagic markers: LC3-II expression  GFP-LC3 puncta formation  autolysosomes  and Atg5-12 and Beclin 1 expression. H2 O2 exposure increased the rates of cell death  LC3-II expression  GFP-LC3 puncta formation  and autolysosomes. After we induced apoptosis arrest using zVAD  H2 O2 exposure still induced cell death  LC3-II expression  and GFP-LC3 puncta formation. H2 O2 exposure also increased Atg5-12 and Beclin 1 expressions  indicating autophagic cell death. However  cyanidin treatment reduced H2 O2 -induced cell death  LC3-II expression  GFP-LC3 puncta formation  and autolysosomes. Cyanidin and 3-MA similarly reduced the cell-death rate  and Atg5-12 and Beclin 1 expression. This study demonstrated that H2 O2   an oxidative stressor  induces autophagic cell death in rotator cuff tenofibroblasts  and that cyanidin  a natural antioxidant  inhibits autophagic cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cellular metabolic and autophagic pathways: traffic control by redox signaling.It has been established that the key metabolic pathways of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are intimately related to redox biology through control of cell signaling. Under physiological conditions glucose metabolism is linked to control of the NADH/NAD redox couple  as well as providing the major reductant  NADPH  for thiol-dependent antioxidant defenses. Retrograde signaling from the mitochondrion to the nucleus or cytosol controls cell growth and differentiation. Under pathological conditions mitochondria are targets for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and are critical in controlling apoptotic cell death. At the interface of these metabolic pathways  the autophagy-lysosomal pathway functions to maintain mitochondrial quality and generally serves an important cytoprotective function. In this review we will discuss the autophagic response to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are generated from perturbations of cellular glucose metabolism and bioenergetic function.,Autophagy_notLIR
The aging heart and post-infarction left ventricular remodeling.Aging is a risk factor for heart failure  which is a leading cause of death world-wide. Elderly patients are more likely than young patients to experience a myocardial infarction (MI) and are more likely to develop heart failure following MI. The poor clinical outcome of aging in cardiovascular disease is recapitulated on the cellular level. Increase in stress exposure and shifts in signaling pathways with age change the biology of cardiomyocytes. The progressive accumulation of metabolic waste and damaged organelles in cardiomyocytes blocks the intracellular recycling process of autophagy and increases the cell's propensity toward apoptosis. Additionally  the decreased cardiomyocyte renewal capacity in the elderly  due to reduction in cellular division and impaired stem cell function  leads to further cardiac dysfunction and maladaptive responses to disease or stress. We review the cellular and molecular aspects of post-infarction remodeling in the aged heart  and relate them to the clinical problem of post-infarction remodeling in elderly patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Variants at the 3p21 locus influence susceptibility and phenotype both in adults and early-onset patients with inflammatory bowel disease.To date  a number of high-profile studies have yielded over 50 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) disease genes/loci. The polymorphisms rs9858542 (BSN) and rs3197999 (MST1)  on 3p21 locus  have been found associated with susceptibility to IBD. We aimed to replicate these associations in adult and early-onset cohorts of IBD Italian patients  by analyzing also potential gene-gene interactions with variants in NOD2/CARD15  IL23R  ATG16L1  and IRGM genes  and investigating genotype-phenotype correlation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanisms of Autophagy.The formation of the autophagosome  a landmark event in autophagy  is accomplished by the concerted actions of Atg proteins. The initial step of starvation-induced autophagy in yeast is the assembly of the Atg1 complex  which  with the help of other Atg groups  recruits Atg conjugation systems and initiates the formation of the autophagosome. In this review  we describe from a structural-biological point of view the structure  interaction  and molecular roles of Atg proteins  especially those in the Atg1 complex and in the Atg conjugation systems.,Autophagy_notLIR
Starvation-induced lysosomal degradation of aldolase B requires glutamine 111 in a signal sequence for chaperone-mediated transport.Aldolase B is an abundant cytosolic protein found in all eukaryotic cells. Like many glycolytic enzymes  this protein was sequestered into lysosomes for degradation during nutrient starvation. We report here that the degradation of recombinant aldolase B was enhanced two-fold when rat and human hepatoma cells were starved for amino acid and serum. In addition  starvation-induced degradation of aldolase B was inhibited by chloroquine  an inhibitor of lysosomal proteinases and by 3-methyladenine  an inhibitor of autophagy. Aldolase B has three lysosomal targeting motifs (Q(12)KKEL  Q(58)FREL  and IKLDQ(111)) that have been proposed to interact with hsc73 thereby initiating its transport into lysosomes. In this study  we have mutated the essential glutamine residues in each of these hsc73-binding motifs in order to evaluate their roles in the lysosomal degradation of aldolase B during starvation. We have found that when glutamines 12 or 58 are mutated to asparagines enhanced degradation of aldolase B proceeded normally. However  when glutamine 111 was mutated to an asparagine or a threonine  starvation-induced degradation was completely suppressed. These mutations did not appear to alter the tertiary structure of aldolase B since enzymatic activity was not affected. Our results suggest that starvation-induced lysosomal degradation of aldolase B requires both autophagy and glutamine 111. We discuss the possible roles for autophagy and hsc73-mediated transport in the lysosomal sequestration of aldolase B.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of HMGB1 release by autophagy.The characteristics of tumor cell killing by an anticancer agent can determine the long-term effectiveness of the treatment. For example  if dying tumor cells release the immune modulator HMGB1 after treatment with anticancer drugs  they can activate a tumor-specific immune response that boosts the effectiveness of the initial treatment. Recent work from our group examined the mechanism of action of a targeted toxin called DT-EGF that selectively kills Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-expressing tumor cells. We found that DT-EGF kills glioblastoma cells by a caspase-independent mechanism that involves high levels of autophagy  which inhibits cell death by blocking apoptosis. In contrast  DT-EGF kills epithelial tumor cells by caspase-dependent apoptosis and in these cells autophagy is not induced. These differences allowed us to discover that the different death mechanisms were associated with differences in the release of HMGB1 and that autophagy induction is required and sufficient to cause release of HMGB1 from the dying cells. These data identify a new function for autophagy during cell death and open up the possibility of manipulating autophagy during cancer treatment as a way to influence the immunogenicity of dying tumor cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Resilience of death: intrinsic disorder in proteins involved in the programmed cell death.It is recognized now that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)  which do not have unique 3D structures as a whole or in noticeable parts  constitute a significant fraction of any given proteome. IDPs are characterized by an astonishing structural and functional diversity that defines their ability to be universal regulators of various cellular pathways. Programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the most intricate cellular processes where the cell uses specialized cellular machinery and intracellular programs to kill itself. This cell-suicide mechanism enables metazoans to control cell numbers and to eliminate cells that threaten the animal's survival. PCD includes several specific modules  such as apoptosis  autophagy  and programmed necrosis (necroptosis). These modules are not only tightly regulated but also intimately interconnected and are jointly controlled via a complex set of protein-protein interactions. To understand the role of the intrinsic disorder in controlling and regulating the PCD  several large sets of PCD-related proteins across 28 species were analyzed using a wide array of modern bioinformatics tools. This study indicates that the intrinsic disorder phenomenon has to be taken into consideration to generate a complete picture of the interconnected processes  pathways  and modules that determine the essence of the PCD. We demonstrate that proteins involved in regulation and execution of PCD possess substantial amount of intrinsic disorder. We annotate functional roles of disorder across and within apoptosis  autophagy  and necroptosis processes. Disordered regions are shown to be implemented in a number of crucial functions  such as protein-protein interactions  interactions with other partners including nucleic acids and other ligands  are enriched in post-translational modification sites  and are characterized by specific evolutionary patterns. We mapped the disorder into an integrated network of PCD pathways and into the interactomes of selected proteins that are involved in the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lethal Cardiomyopathy in Mice Lacking Transferrin Receptor in the Heart.Both iron overload and iron deficiency have been associated with cardiomyopathy and heart failure  but cardiac iron utilization is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that the transferrin receptor (Tfr1) might play a role in cardiac iron uptake and used gene targeting to examine the role of Tfr1 in vivo. Surprisingly  we found that decreased iron  due to inactivation of Tfr1  was associated with severe cardiac consequences. Mice lacking Tfr1 in the heart died in the second week of life and had cardiomegaly  poor cardiac function  failure of mitochondrial respiration  and ineffective mitophagy. The phenotype could only be rescued by aggressive iron therapy  but it was ameliorated by administration of nicotinamide riboside  an NAD precursor. Our findings underscore the importance of both Tfr1 and iron in the heart  and may inform therapy for patients with heart failure.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in ageing and ageing-associated diseases.Autophagy is a cell self-digestion process via lysosomes that clears "cellular waste"  including aberrantly modified proteins or protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Therefore  autophagy is considered a protein and organelle quality control mechanism that maintains normal cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctional autophagy has been observed in ageing tissues and several ageing-associated diseases. Lifespan of model organisms such as yeast  worms  flies  and mice can be extended through promoting autophagy  either by genetic manipulations such as over-expression of Sirtuin 1  or by administrations of rapamycin  resveratrol or spermidine. The evidence supports that autophagy may play an important role in delaying ageing or extending lifespan. In this review  we summarize the current knowledge about autophagy and its regulation  outline recent developments ie the genetic and pharmacological manipulations of autophagy that affects the lifespan  and discuss the role of autophagy in the ageing-related diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
TECPR2 mutations cause a new subtype of familial dysautonomia like hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy with intellectual disability.TECPR2 was first described as a disease causing gene when the c.3416delT frameshift mutation was found in five Jewish Bukharian patients with similar features. It was suggested to constitute a new subtype of complex hereditary spastic paraparesis (SPG49).,Autophagy_notLIR
PARP-1 is involved in autophagy induced by DNA damage.Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradative pathway frequently activated in tumor cells treated with chemotherapy or radiation. PARP-1 has been implicated in different pathways leading to cell death and its inhibition potentiates chemotherapy-induced cell death. Whether PARP-1 participates in the cell's decision to commit to autophagy following DNA damage is still not known. To address this issue PARP-1 wild-type and deficient cells have been treated with a dose of doxorubicin that induces autophagy. Electron microscopy examination and GFP-LC3 transfection revealed autophagic vesicles and increased expression of genes involved in autophagy (bnip-3  cathepsin b and l and beclin-1) in wild-type cells treated with doxo but not in parp-1(-/-) cells or cells treated with a PARP inhibitor. Mechanistically the lack of autophagic features in PARP-1 deficient/PARP inhibited cells is attributed to prevention of ATP and NAD(+) depletion and to the activation of the key autophagy regulator mTOR. Pharmacological or genetical inhibition of autophagy results in increased cell death  suggesting a protective role of autophagy induced by doxorubicin. These results suggest that autophagy might be cytoprotective during the response to DNA damage and suggest that PARP-1 activation is involved in the cell's decision to undergo autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of AMP-activated protein kinase in autophagy and proteasome function.In this work  we have examined the possible role of AMP-activated protein kinase (a key energy sensor) in regulating intracellular protein degradation. We have found that AICAR  a known activator of AMPK  has a dual effect. On one hand  it inhibits autophagy by a mechanism independent of AMPK activity; AICAR decreases class III PI3-kinase binding to beclin-1 and this effect counteracts and reverses the known positive effect of AMPK activity on autophagy. On the other hand  AICAR inhibits the proteasomal degradation of proteins by an AMPK-dependent mechanism. This is a novel function of AMPK that allows the regulation of proteasomal activity under conditions of energy demand.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of autophagy in liver cancer: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for degradation of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles via lysosome. Proteins coded by the autophagy-related genes (Atgs) are the core molecular machinery in control of autophagy. Among the various biological functions of autophagy identified so far  the link between autophagy and cancer is probably among the most extensively studied and is often viewed as controversial. Autophagy might exert a dual role in cancer development: autophagy can serve as an anti-tumor mechanism  as defective autophagy (e.g.  heterozygous knockdown Beclin 1 and Atg7 in mice) promotes the malignant transformation and spontaneous tumors. On the other hand  autophagy functions as a protective or survival mechanism in cancer cells against cellular stress (e.g.  nutrient deprivation  hypoxia and DNA damage) and hence promotes tumorigenesis and causes resistance to therapeutic agents. Liver cancer is one of the common cancers with well-established etiological factors including hepatitis virus infection and environmental carcinogens such as aflatoxin and alcohol exposure. In recent years  the involvement of autophagy in liver cancer has been increasingly studied. Here  we aim to provide a systematic review on the close cross-talks between autophagy and liver cancer  and summarize the current status in development of novel liver cancer therapeutic approaches by targeting autophagy. It is believed that understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the autophagy modulation and liver cancer development may provoke the translational studies that ultimately lead to new therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Degradation of lipid vesicles in the yeast vacuole requires function of Cvt17  a putative lipase.The vacuole/lysosome serves an essential role in allowing cellular components to be degraded and recycled under starvation conditions. Vacuolar hydrolases are key proteins in this process. In Saccharyomces cerevisiae  some resident vacuolar hydrolases are delivered by the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway  which shares mechanistic features with autophagy. Autophagy is a degradative pathway that is used to degrade and recycle cellular components under starvation conditions. Both the Cvt pathway and autophagy employ double-membrane cytosolic vesicles to deliver cargo to the vacuole. As a result  these pathways share a common terminal step  the degradation of subvacuolar vesicles. We have identified a protein  Cvt17  which is essential for this membrane lytic event. Cvt17 is a membrane glycoprotein that contains a motif conserved in esterases and lipases. The active-site serine of this motif is required for subvacuolar vesicle lysis. This is the first characterization of a putative lipase implicated in vacuolar function in yeast.,Autophagy_notLIR
Insights into IBD Pathogenesis.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)  is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by dysregulated immune responses in a genetically predisposed individual. Recent accumulating data  including genome-wide association studies  have identified more than 50 distinct genetic loci that confer susceptibility. We highlight the role of microbial-host interaction  particularly with respect to the overlap of common genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms of CD and UC  interleukin-22-producing natural killer cells  autophagy  and TL1A  a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family  in gut homeostasis and IBD pathogenesis. This article focuses on the recent advances in understanding of IBD from the past year  including advances in genetics and immunobiology.,Autophagy_notLIR
LC3 fluorescent puncta in autophagosomes or in protein aggregates can be distinguished by FRAP analysis in living cells.LC3 is a marker protein that is involved in the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes  which are usually characterized and monitored by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 probes (FP-LC3). FP-LC3 and even endogenous LC3 can also be incorporated into intracellular protein aggregates in an autophagy-independent manner. However  the dynamic process of LC3 associated with autophagosomes and autolysosomes or protein aggregates in living cells remains unclear. Here  we explored the dynamic properties of the two types of FP-LC3-containing puncta using fluorescence microscopy techniques  including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The FRAP data revealed that the fluorescent signals of FP-LC3 attached to phagophores or in mature autolysosomes showed either minimal or no recovery after photobleaching  indicating that the dissociation of LC3 from the autophagosome membranes may be very slow. In contrast  FP-LC3 in the protein aggregates exhibited nearly complete recovery (more than 80%) and rapid kinetics of association and dissociation (half-time < 1 sec)  indicating a rapid exchange occurs between the aggregates and cytoplasmic pool  which is mainly due to the transient interaction of LC3 and SQSTM1/p62. Based on the distinct dynamic properties of FP-LC3 in the two types of punctate structures  we provide a convenient and useful FRAP approach to distinguish autophagosomes from LC3-involved protein aggregates in living cells. Using this approach  we find the FP-LC3 puncta that adjacently localized to the phagophore marker ATG16L1 were protein aggregate-associated LC3 puncta  which exhibited different kinetics compared with that of autophagic structures.,Autophagy_notLIR
Disruption of autophagy results in constitutive oxidative stress in Arabidopsis.Plant cells frequently encounter oxidative stress  leading to oxidative damage and inactivation of proteins. We have recently demonstrated that oxidative stress induces autophagy in Arabidopsis seedlings in an AtATG18a-dependent manner and that RNAi-AtATG18a transgenic lines  which are defective in autophagosome formation  are hypersensitive to reactive oxygen species. Analysis of protein oxidation indicated that oxidized proteins are degraded in the vacuole after uptake by autophagy  and this degradation is impaired in RNAi-AtATG18a lines. Our results also suggest that in the absence of a functional autophagy pathway  plants are under increased oxidative stress  even under normal growth conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Immunohistochemical analysis of the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy lysosome system induced after traumatic intracranial injury: association with time between the injury and death.This study aimed to analyze how the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) or autophagy lysosome system (autophagy) are induced in brain tissues at different intervals after traumatic intracranial injury in humans. Injured cerebral cortices of 36 forensic autopsy cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies as the UPS marker (ubiquitin and lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains [K48]) and autophagy marker (lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains [K63]  p62/sequestome 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 [LC3]). The number of neurons and glial cells with cytoplasmic inclusions that stained positive for ubiquitin  K48  and p62 began to increase within 1 hour after intracranial injury  particularly at contusion sites. From 3.5 hours onward  an increase in cytoplasmic inclusions that stained positive for K63 and LC3 began to be detected. LC3-positive cytoplasmic inclusions were not identified after 37 days; however  the increased immunoreactivity to ubiquitin and anti-K48 antibody was maintained for 7 months. These results suggest that the UPS is activated earlier and lasts longer than autophagy  that autophagy is activated for a relatively short term (between a few hours and approximately 1 month)  and that the activation occurs especially in severely damaged brain tissues following head trauma in humans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in the fat body cells of the cave cricket Troglophilus neglectus Krauss  1878 (Rhaphidophoridae  Saltatoria) during overwintering.The cave cricket Troglophilus neglectus regularly overwinters for 4-5 months in hypogean habitats. Winter dormancy is a natural starvation period  providing the opportunity to study autophagy under natural conditions. We aimed to evaluate the autophagic activity in adipocytes and urocytes of the fat body in three time frames: directly before overwintering  in the middle of dormancy  and at its end. For this purpose  we sampled individuals in caves. The cell ultrastructure was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the abundance of autophagosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM)  applying the widely used  specific immunolabeling marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Before overwintering  TEM revealed scarce autophagosomes and residual bodies in the adipocytes and none in the urocytes. Congruently  IFM showed a very limited or no reaction. In the middle and at the end of overwintering  in both cell types  phagophores  autophagosomes  autolysosomes  and residual bodies were identified by TEM  while LC3 immunolabeling for detecting autophagosomes showed a conspicuous positive reaction. Both methods revealed that there were no significant differences between the sexes in any time frame. Minimal autophagic activity was detected before the winter dormancy  and it gradually intensified till the end of overwintering  probably because reserve proteins in protein granula are not composed of all the required amino acids. We conclude that in T. neglectus  autophagy is a substantial response to starvation and supports homeostatic processes during winter dormancy by supplying cells with nutrients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy proteins stabilize pathogen-containing phagosomes for prolonged MHC II antigen processing.Antigen preservation for presentation is a hallmark of potent antigen-presenting cells. In this paper  we report that in human macrophages and dendritic cells  a subset of phagosomes gets coated with Atg8/LC3  a component of the molecular machinery of macroautophagy  and maintains phagocytosed antigens for prolonged presentation on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. These Atg8/LC3-positive phagosomes are formed around the antigen with TLR2 agonists and require reactive oxygen species production by NOX2 for their generation. A deficiency in the NOX2-dependent formation of these antigen storage phagosomes could contribute to compromise antifungal immune control in chronic granulomatous disease patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Proteasome inhibition can induce an autophagy-dependent apical activation of caspase-8.Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are often highly expressed in chemotherapy-resistant cancers and impair mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP)  an important requirement for caspase activation via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Interestingly  although Bcl-2 overexpression in HeLa cervical cancer cells abrogated caspase processing in response to intrinsic apoptosis induction by staurosporine  tunicamycin or etoposide  residual caspase processing was observed following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib ([(1R)-3-methyl-1-({(2S)-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]propanoyl}amino)butyl]boronic acid)  epoxomicin (N-acetyl-N-methyl-lisoleucyl-L-isoleucyl-N-[(1S)-3-methyl-1-[[(2R)-2-methyloxiranyl]carbonyl]butyl]-L-threoninamide) or MG-132 (N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)leucinylleucinylleucinal). Similar responses were found in Bcl-2-overexpressing H460 NSCLC cells and Bax/Bak-deficient mouse embyronic fibroblasts. Mild caspase processing resulted in low DEVDase activities  which were MOMP independent and persisted for long periods without evoking immediate cell death. Surprisingly  depletion of caspase-3 and experiments in caspase-7-depleted MCF-7-Bcl-2 cells indicated that the DEVDase activity did not originate from effector caspases. Instead  Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-dependent caspase-8 activation was the major contributor to the slow  incomplete substrate cleavage. Caspase-8 activation was independent of death ligands  but required the induction of autophagy and the presence of Atg5. Depletion of XIAP or addition of XIAP-antagonising peptides resulted in a switch towards efficient apoptosis execution  suggesting that the requirement for MOMP was bypassed by activating the caspase-8/caspase-3 axis. Combination treatments of proteasome inhibitors and XIAP antagonists therefore represent a promising strategy to eliminate highly resistant cancer cells  which overexpress antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.,Autophagy_notLIR
3-Methyladenine induces cell death and its interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs is independent of autophagy.3-Methyladenine (3-MA) is an autophagy inhibitor and has been widely used as a pharmacological tool in the autophagy studies. 3-MA potentiates the chemotherapeutic effects of anticancer drugs  but it is not clear whether the potentiating effects of 3-MA on chemotherapy efficacy comes from the autophagy inhibition or not. The aim of the present work is to identify the relationship between the effects of 3-MA on chemotherapy and the 3-MA-induced autophagy inhibition. The autophagy responses were evaluated by measuring LC3-II level. Cell viability  cell death and cell apoptosis were evaluated by MTT  live and dead assay kit and Tunel staining. Results showed that 3-MA dose-dependently reduced Hela cell viability but did not affect the basal autophagy responses. 3-MA at the concentration that inhibits autophagy induced Hela cell death and apoptosis. 3-MA did not inhibit the increased autophagy responses induced by chemotherapeutic drugs cispcis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)  tamoxifen and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in Hela and MCF-7 cells. The synergism or antagonism between 3-MA and chemotherapeutic drugs was dependent on the inhibition ratio of tumor cells. In conclusion  3-MA itself induces cell death and apoptosis without relationship with autophagy; 3-MA does not inhibit the increased autophagy induced by anti-cancer drugs; the interaction between 3-MA and chemotherapeutic drugs is not related to autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of autophagy in cells with abnormal karyotype.The presence of even one extra chromosome severely impairs cellular growth. This effect of aneuploidy (a term describing chromosome numbers deviating from multiples of haploid chromosome content) has been observed in many different organisms  from yeast to humans. Accordingly  abnormal karyotypes are detected in nearly 30% of spontaneously aborted embryos. The rarely surviving infants  such as with trisomy of chromosome 21  are severely handicapped. The causes remain enigmatic  although recent studies exploiting yeast and mouse models provided first glimpses of the imbalanced inner life of aneuploid cells. Using comparative genomics  transcriptomics and proteomics we have analyzed the fate of the transcripts and proteins coded on the extra chromosomes as well as the general response to aneuploidy in human cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy: a broad role in unconventional protein secretion?Autophagy  a cellular 'self-eating' process in eukaryotic cells  exists in both a basal and in an activated state that is induced in response to starvation. Basal and induced autophagy are associated with the packaging of cellular components  including damaged and/or redundant organelles  into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes  followed by autophagosome fusion with lysosomes  in which their contents are degraded and recycled. Recent results highlight a novel role for autophagy that does not involve lysosomal degradation of autophagosomal contents  but instead involves their redirection towards the extracellular delivery of an unconventionally secreted protein. Here  we discuss these findings  evaluate the strength of evidence  consider their implications for the field of protein trafficking  and suggest the next steps required to probe this interesting pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
The ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is required for ribosome stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Rsp5p is a conserved HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase with diverse roles in cellular physiology. Here we report a previously unknown role of Rsp5p in facilitating the stability of the cytoplasmic ribosome pool in budding yeast. Yeast strains carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in RSP5 showed a progressive decline in levels of 18S and 25S rRNAs and accumulation of rRNA decay fragments when cells grown in rich medium were shifted to restrictive temperature. This was accompanied by a decreased number of translating ribosomes and the appearance of ribosomal subunits with an abnormally low sedimentation rate in polysome analysis. Abrogating Rsp5p function affected stability of other tested noncoding RNA species (tRNA and snoRNA)  but to a lower extent than that of rRNA  and also inhibited processing of rRNA and tRNA precursors  in agreement with previous studies. The breakdown of cellular ribosomes was not affected by deletion of key genes involved in autophagy  previously implicated in ribosome turnover upon starvation. Our results suggest that functional Rsp5p is required to maintain the integrity of cytoplasmic ribosomes under rich nutrient conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
EGFR-targeted plasmonic magnetic nanoparticles suppress lung tumor growth by abrogating G2/M cell-cycle arrest and inducing DNA damage.We have previously demonstrated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted hybrid plasmonic magnetic nanoparticles (225-NP) produce a therapeutic effect in human lung cancer cell lines in vitro. In the present study  we investigated the molecular mechanism of 225-NP-mediated antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo using the EGFR-mutant HCC827 cell line.,Autophagy_notLIR
Immunologic manifestations of autophagy.The broad immunologic roles of autophagy span innate and adaptive immunity and are often manifested in inflammatory diseases. The immune effects of autophagy partially overlap with its roles in metabolism and cytoplasmic quality control but typically expand further afield to encompass unique immunologic adaptations. One of the best-appreciated manifestations of autophagy is protection against microbial invasion  but this is by no means limited to direct elimination of intracellular pathogens and includes a stratified array of nearly all principal immunologic processes. This Review summarizes the broad immunologic roles of autophagy. Furthermore  it uses the autophagic control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a paradigm to illustrate the breadth and complexity of the immune effects of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Adenosine uptake is the major effector of extracellular ATP toxicity in human cervical cancer cells.In cervical cancer  HPV infection and disruption of mechanisms involving cell growth  differentiation  and apoptosis are strictly linked with tumor progression and invasion. Tumor microenvironment is ATP and adenosine rich  suggesting a role for purinergic signaling in cancer cell growth and death. Here we investigate the effect of extracellular ATP on human cervical cancer cells. We find that extracellular ATP itself has a small cytotoxic effect  whereas adenosine formed from ATP degradation by ectonucleotidases is the main factor responsible for apoptosis induction. The level of P2 × 7 receptor seemed to define the main cytotoxic mechanism triggered by ATP  since ATP itself eliminated a small subpopulation of cells that express high P2 × 7 levels  probably through its activation. Corroborating these data  blockage or knockdown of P2 × 7 only slightly reduced ATP cytotoxicity. On the other hand  cell viability was almost totally recovered with dipyridamole  an adenosine transporter inhibitor. Moreover  ATP-induced apoptosis and signaling-p53 increase  AMPK activation  and PARP cleavage-as well as autophagy induction were also inhibited by dipyridamole. In addition  inhibition of adenosine conversion into AMP also blocked cell death  indicating that metabolization of intracellular adenosine originating from extracellular ATP is responsible for the main effects of the latter in human cervical cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
K63 linked ubiquitin chain formation is a signal for HIF1A degradation by Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy.Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy is a selective form of autophagy. Recently  the degradation of a newly identified CMA substrate  the HIF1A transcription factor  was found to be regulated by the ubiquitin ligase STUB1. In this study we show  for the first time  that K63 ubiquitination is necessary for CMA degradation of HIF1A in vitro and in vivo. Additionally  STUB1 mediates K63 linked ubiquitination of HIF1A. Our findings add a new regulatory step and increase the specificity of the molecular mechanism involved in CMA degradation of HIF1A  expanding the role of ubiquitination to yet another biological process  since the same mechanism might be applicable to other CMA substrates.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hypoxia-induced autophagy confers resistance of breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation.Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors  which presents a major obstacle to the effectiveness of radiation therapy. However  the function and the importance of molecular response have not been well defined. In the present study  hypoxia-induced autophagy and its effect on the response of breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation were examined. Results showed that hypoxic exposure induced a marked accumulation of autophagosomes accompanied by mRNA induction of the autophagy-related genes Beclin-1  Atg5  Atg7  and Atg12. The elevated autophagic activity was associated with increased radioresistance of tumor cells. Accordingly  blockade of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition or Beclin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) contributed to retardation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair and significant radiosensitization. Our data indicate that strategies designed to suppress autophagic activity may represent promising new therapies for sensitizing hypoxic breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR).,Autophagy_notLIR
Genistein potentiates the antitumor effect of 5-Fluorouracil by inducing apoptosis and autophagy in human pancreatic cancer cells.Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based combination chemotherapy (i.e. FOLFIRINOX) has demonstrated effectiveness against pancreatic cancer  novel therapeutic strategies must be developed to increase the therapeutic window of these cytotoxic agents. Genistein is a soy-derived isoflavone with pleiotropic biological effects that can enhance the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic agents.,Autophagy_notLIR
Structural basis of competitive recognition of p53 and MDM2 by HAUSP/USP7: implications for the regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway.Herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP  also known as USP7)  a deubiquitylating enzyme of the ubiquitin-specific processing protease family  specifically deubiquitylates both p53 and MDM2  hence playing an important yet enigmatic role in the p53-MDM2 pathway. Here we demonstrate that both p53 and MDM2 specifically recognize the N-terminal tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor (TRAF)-like domain of HAUSP in a mutually exclusive manner. HAUSP preferentially forms a stable HAUSP-MDM2 complex even in the presence of excess p53. The HAUSP-binding elements were mapped to a peptide fragment in the carboxy-terminus of p53 and to a short-peptide region preceding the acidic domain of MDM2. The crystal structures of the HAUSP TRAF-like domain in complex with p53 and MDM2 peptides  determined at 2.3-A and 1.7-A resolutions  respectively  reveal that the MDM2 peptide recognizes the same surface groove in HAUSP as that recognized by p53 but mediates more extensive interactions. Structural comparison led to the identification of a consensus peptide-recognition sequence by HAUSP. These results  together with the structure of a combined substrate-binding-and-deubiquitylation domain of HAUSP  provide important insights into regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway by HAUSP.,Autophagy_notLIR

BCL-2 inhibitors sensitize therapy-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to VSV oncolysis.Many primary cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-induced oncolysis due to overexpression of the antiapoptotic and antiautophagic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family. In the present study  we investigated the mechanisms of CLL cell death induced as a consequence of VSV infection in the presence of BCL-2 inhibitors  obatoclax  and ABT-737 in primary ex vivo CLL patient samples. Microarray analysis of primary CD19⁺ CD5⁺ CLL cells treated with obatoclax and VSV revealed changes in expression of genes regulating apoptosis  the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway  and cellular metabolism. A combined therapeutic effect was observed for VSV and BCL-2 inhibitors in cells from untreated patients and from patients unresponsive to standard of care therapy. In addition  combination treatment induced several markers of autophagy--LC3-II accumulation  p62 degradation  and staining of autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of early stage autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) led to increased apoptosis in CLL samples. Mechanistically  a combination of BCL-2 inhibitors and VSV disrupted inhibitory interactions of Beclin-1 with BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1)  thus biasing cells toward autophagy. We propose a mechanism in which changes in cellular metabolism  coupled with pharmacologic disruption of the BCL-2-Beclin-1 interactions  facilitate induction of apoptosis and autophagy to mediate the cytolytic effect of VSV.,Autophagy_notLIR
Frequency and selectivity of mitochondrial fusion are key to its quality maintenance function.Turnover of mitochondria by autophagy constitutes an essential quality maintenance mechanism. Recent studies have demonstrated that efficient clearance of damaged mitochondrial components depends on mitochondrial dynamics  a process characterized by frequent fusion and fission events that enable the redistribution of mitochondrial components across a population of hundreds of individual mitochondria. The presented simulation identifies kinetic parameters of fusion and fission that may influence the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The program simulated repetitive cycles of fusion and fission events in which intact and damaged mitochondrial contents were redistributed between fusion mates. Redistribution impacted mitochondrial function  thereby influencing the fate of each mitochondrion  to be either destined for a subsequent fusion or eliminated by autophagy. Our findings indicate that  when paired with fission  fusion events may serve to accelerate the removal of damaged mitochondrial components by autophagy. The model predicts the existence of an optimal frequency of fusion and fission events that can maintain respiratory function at steady-state levels amid the existence of a continuous damaging process that inactivates mitochondrial components. A further elevation of the fusion frequency can increase the clearance efficiency of damaged content. However  this requires fusion to be a selective process in which depolarized mitochondria are excluded from the fusing population. The selectivity of fusion was found to be particularly beneficial in conditions of elevated rate of damage  because it permits the increase of fusion frequency without compromising the removal of damaged content by autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Structural stress responses and degradation of dictyosomes in algae analysed by TEM and FIB-SEM tomography.Stress-induced physiological deficiencies in cells are reflected in structural  morphological and functional reactions of organelles. Although numerous investigations have focused on chloroplasts and mitochondria as main targets of different stressors in plant cells  there is insufficient information on the plant Golgi apparatus as stress sensor. By using the advantages of field emission scanning electron microscopy tomography in combination with classical ultrathin sectioning and transmission electron microscopic analyses  we provide structural evidence for common stress responses of the large and highly stable dictyosomes in the algal model system Micrasterias. Stress is induced by different metals such as manganese and lead  by starvation in 9 weeks of darkness or by inhibiting photosynthesis or glycolysis and by disturbing ionic homeostasis via KCl. For the first time a stress-induced degradation pathway of dictyosomes is described that does not follow "classical" autophagy but occurs by disintegration of cisternae into single membrane balls that seem to be finally absorbed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Comparison of the morphological features that accompany dictyosomal degradation in Micrasterias to similar reactions observed during the same stress application in Nitella indicates an ubiquitous degradation process at least in algae. As the algae investigated belong to the closest relatives of higher land plants these results may also be relevant for understanding dictyosomal stress and degradation responses in the latter phylogenetic group. In addition  this study shows that two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy is insufficient for elucidating complex processes such as organelle degradation  and that information from three-dimensional reconstructions as provided by field emission scanning electron microscopy tomography is absolutely required for a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dissociation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex by activated AMPK enhances cardiac autophagy and protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetes.Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with suppression of cardiac autophagy  and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) restores cardiac autophagy and prevents cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice  albeit by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2  a switch between autophagy and apoptosis  in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity  inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling  and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely  activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK  which normalized cardiac autophagy  attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally  chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Involvement of autophagy in antitumor activity of folate-appended methyl-β-cyclodextrin.Autophagy  the major lysosomal pathway for recycling intracellular components including organelles  is emerging as a key process regulating tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. Most recently  we newly synthesized folate-appended methyl-β-cyclodextrin (FA-M-β-CyD)  and demonstrated the potential of FA-M-β-CyD as a new antitumor drug. In this study  we investigated whether anticancer activity of FA-M-β-CyD in folate receptor-α (FR-α)-positive tumor cells is involved in autophagy. In contrast to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CyD)  FA-M-β-CyD entered KB cells (FR-α (+)) through CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. No significant depression in the DNA content was observed in KB cells after treatment with FA-M-β-CyD. Additionally  the transmembrane potential of mitochondria after treatment with FA-M-β-CyD was drastically elevated. Meanwhile  FA-M-β-CyD induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles  which were partially colocalized with mitochondria  in KB cells. Taken together  these results suggest that FR-α-expressing cell-selective cytotoxic activity of FA-M-β-CyD could be mediated by the regulation of autophagy  rather than the induction of apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ophiopogonin D attenuates doxorubicin-induced autophagic cell death by relieving mitochondrial damage in vitro and in vivo.It has been reported that ophiopogonin D (OP-D)  a steroidal glycoside and an active component extracted from Ophiopogon japonicas  promotes antioxidative protection of the cardiovascular system. However  it is unknown whether OP-D exerts protective effects against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte injury. Here  we demonstrate that DOX induced excessive autophagy through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H9c2 cells and in mouse hearts  which was indicated by a significant increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles  LC3-II/LC3-I ratio  and upregulation of the expression of GFP-LC3. Pretreatment with OP-D partially attenuated the above phenomena  similar to the effects of treatment with 3-methyladenine. In addition  OP-D treatment significantly relieved the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential by antioxidative effects through downregulating the expression of both phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The ability of OP-D to reduce the generation of ROS due to mitochondrial damage and  consequently  to inhibit autophagic activity partially accounts for its protective effects in the hearts against DOX-induced toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aggrephagy: lessons from C. elegans.Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradation process that involves the formation of an enclosed double-membrane autophagosome. Yeast genetic screens have laid the groundwork for a molecular understanding of autophagy. The process  however  exhibits fundamental differences between yeast and higher eukaryotes. Very little is known about essential autophagy components specific to higher eukaryotes. Recent studies have shown that a variety of protein aggregates are selectively removed by autophagy (a process termed aggrephagy) during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis  establishing C. elegans as a multicellular genetic model to delineate the autophagic machinery. The genetic screens were carried out in C. elegans to identify essential autophagy genes. In addition to conserved and divergent homologues of yeast Atg proteins  several autophagy genes conserved in higher eukaryotes  but absent from yeast  were isolated. The genetic hierarchy of autophagy genes in the degradation of protein aggregates in C. elegans provides a framework for understanding the concerted action of autophagy genes in the aggrephagy pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ubiquilin 2 is not associated with tau pathology.Accumulation of aberrant proteins in inclusion bodies is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Impairment of proteolytic systems is a common event in these protein misfolding diseases. Recently  mutations in the UBQLN 2 gene encoding ubiquilin 2 have been identified in X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Furthermore  ubiquilin 2 is associated with inclusions in familial and sporadic ALS/dementia  synucleinopathies and polyglutamine diseases. Ubiquilin 2 exerts a regulatory role in proteostasis and thus it has been suggested that ubiquilin 2 pathology may be a common event in neurodegenerative diseases. Tauopathies  a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative diseases accompanied with dementia  are characterized by inclusions of the microtubule-binding protein tau. In the present study  we investigate whether ubiquilin 2 is connected with tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD)  supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease (PiD) and familial cases with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). We show that ubiquilin 2 positive inclusions are absent in these tauopathies. Furthermore  we find decreased ubiquilin 2 protein levels in AD patients  but our results do not indicate a correlation with tau pathology. Our data show no evidence for involvement of ubiquilin 2 and indicate that other mechanisms underly the proteostatic disturbances in tauopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
PERK-dependent regulation of MDA-7/IL-24-induced autophagy in primary human glioma cells.Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin 24 (mda-7/IL-24) is a novel cytokine displaying selective apoptosis-inducing activity in transformed cells without harming normal cells. The studies by Yacoub et al. (Mol Cancer Ther 2008; 7:314-29) further defines the mechanism(s) by which a GST-MDA-7 fusion protein inhibits cell survival of primary human glioma cells in vitro. GST-MDA-7 killed glioma cells with diverse genetic characteristics that were dependent on activation of JNK1-3 with subsequent activation of BAX and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of JNK1-3 was dependent upon protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and GST-MDA-7 lethality was suppressed in PERK(-/-) cells. GST-MDA-7 caused PERK-dependent vacuolization of LC3-expressing endosomes whose formation was suppressed by incubation with 3-methyladenine  expression of HSP70 or of BiP/GRP78  or by knockdown of ATG5 or Beclin 1 expression  but not by inhibition of the JNK1-3 pathway. Knockdown of ATG5 or Beclin 1 expression or overexpression of HSP70 reduced GST-MDA-7 lethality. Our data demonstrate that GST-MDA-7 induces an ER stress response that  via the induction of autophagy  is causal in the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways that converge on the mitochondrion and ultimately culminate in decreased glioma cell survival.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy promotes survival of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve axotomy in mice.Autophagy is an essential recycling pathway implicated in neurodegeneration either as a pro-survival or a pro-death mechanism. Its role after axonal injury is still uncertain. Axotomy of the optic nerve is a classical model of neurodegeneration. It induces retinal ganglion cell death  a process also occurring in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. We analyzed autophagy induction and cell survival following optic nerve transection (ONT) in mice. Our results demonstrate activation of autophagy shortly after axotomy with autophagosome formation  upregulation of the autophagy regulator Atg5 and apoptotic death of 50% of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after 5 days. Genetic downregulation of autophagy using knockout mice for Atg4B (another regulator of autophagy) or with specific deletion of Atg5 in retinal ganglion cells  using the Atg5(flox/flox) mice reduces cell survival after ONT  whereas pharmacological induction of autophagy in vivo increases the number of surviving cells. In conclusion  our data support that autophagy has a cytoprotective role in RGCs after traumatic injury and may provide a new therapeutic strategy to ameliorate retinal diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Upregulation of autophagy decreases chlorine-induced mitochondrial injury and lung inflammation.The mechanisms of toxicity during exposure of the airways to chlorinated biomolecules generated during the course of inflammation and to chlorine (Cl2) gas are poorly understood. We hypothesized that lung epithelial cell mitochondria are damaged by Cl2 exposure and activation of autophagy mitigates this injury. To address this  NCI-H441 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial) cells were exposed to Cl2 (100 ppm/15 min) and bioenergetics were assessed. One hour after Cl2  cellular bioenergetic function and mitochondrial membrane potential were decreased. These changes were associated with increased MitoSOX signal  and treatment with the mitochondrial redox modulator MitoQ attenuated these bioenergetic defects. At 6h postexposure  there was significant increase in autophagy  which was associated with an improvement of mitochondrial function. Pretreatment of H441 cells with trehalose (an autophagy activator) improved bioenergetic function  whereas 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) resulted in increased bioenergetic dysfunction 1h after Cl2 exposure. These data indicate that Cl2 induces bioenergetic dysfunction  and autophagy plays a protective role in vitro. Addition of trehalose (2 vol%) to the drinking water of C57BL/6 mice for 6 weeks  but not 1 week  before Cl2 (400 ppm/30 min) decreased white blood cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 6h after Cl2 by 70%. Acute administration of trehalose delivered through inhalation 24 and 1h before the exposure decreased alveolar permeability but not cell infiltration. These data indicate that Cl2 induces bioenergetic dysfunction associated with lung inflammation and suggests that autophagy plays a protective role.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial fusion/fission  transport and autophagy in Parkinson's disease: when mitochondria get nasty.Understanding the molecular basis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has proven to be a major challenge in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD  a growing body of evidence has highlighted the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and the disruption of the mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in PD and other parkinsonian disorders. In this paper  we comment on the recent advances in how changes in the mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics (fusion/fission  transport  and clearance) contribute to neurodegeneration  specifically focusing on PD. We also evaluate the current controversies in those issues and discuss the role of fusion/fission dynamics in the mitochondrial lifecycle and maintenance. We propose that cellular demise and neurodegeneration in PD are due to the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction  mitochondrial trafficking disruption  and impaired autophagic clearance.,Autophagy_notLIR
The vesicle-associated function of NOD2 as a link between Crohn's disease and mycobacterial infection.Although Crohn's disease (CD) etiology remains unclear  a growing body of evidence suggests that CD may include an infectious component  with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) being the most likely candidate for this role. However  the molecular mechanism of the MAP involvement in CD pathogenesis remains unclear. The polymorphism of the NOD2 gene  coding for an intracellular pattern recognition receptor  is a factor of predisposition to mycobacterial infections and CD. Recent findings on NOD2 interactions and functions provide the missing pieces in the puzzle of a NOD2-mediated mechanism common for mycobacterial infections and CD. Implications of these new findings for the development of a better understanding and treatments of CD and mycobacterial infections are discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes limits the contractile efficiency of the heart during sepsis. Prosurvival autophagy has been proposed as a novel mechanism to maintain normal heart function. Here  we demonstrated that autophagy was activated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated HL-1 cells  and it counteracted the LPS-induced apoptosis. We investigated further the mechanism by which LPS triggered autophagy in HL-1 cells. We discovered that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress played an important role in LPS-triggered autophagy. The ER activated a survival pathway through the ER-localized transmembrane protein PERK  which was essential for LPS-induced autophagy. Lipopolysaccharide increased expression of GRP78  phosphorylated PERK and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. Similar results were observed after administration of tunicamycin  a well-known ER stressor. Most importantly  we found that 4-phenylbutyrate  an inhibitor of ER stress  suppressed LPS-activated autophagy in the presence of LPS in HL-1 cells. The same results were observed after small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of PERK protein. We also noticed that LPS-induced apoptosis appeared early  at 4 h. Our findings revealed that PERK  one arm of ER stress  facilitated survival of LPS-treated HL-1 cells by promoting autophagy  and could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate septic myocardial dysfunction.,Autophagy_notLIR

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induce apoptosis via a novel pathway: involvement of Ca2+ mediated by interleukin-8 protein.Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in diabetic patients due to high blood glucose levels and cause multiple deleterious effects. In this study  we provide evidence that the AGE increased cell death  one such deleterious effect. Methyl glyoxal-coupled human serum albumin (AGE-HSA) induced transcription factors such as NF-κB  NF-AT  and AP-1. AGE acts through its cell surface receptor  RAGE  and degranulates vesicular contents including interleukin-8 (IL-8). The number of RAGEs  as well as the amount of NF-κB activation  is low  but the cell death is higher in neuronal cells upon AGE treatment. Degranulated IL-8 acts through its receptors  IL-8Rs  and induces sequential events in cells: increase in intracellular Ca(2+)  activation of calcineurin  dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NF-AT  nuclear translocation of NF-AT  and expression of FasL. Expressed FasL increases activity of caspases and induces cell death. Although AGE increases the amount of reactive oxygen intermediate  accompanying cell death is not dependent upon reactive oxygen intermediate. AGE induces autophagy  which partially protects cells from cell death. A novel mechanism of AGE-mediated cell death in different cell types  especially in neuronal cells where it is an early event  is provided here. Thus  this study may be important in several age-related neuronal diseases where AGE-induced apoptosis is observed because of high amounts of AGE.,Autophagy_notLIR
Iron necessity: the secret of Wolbachia's success?The bacterium Wolbachia (order Rickettsiales) is probably the world's most successful vertically-transmitted symbiont  distributed among a staggering 40% of terrestrial arthropod species. Wolbachia has great potential in vector control due to its ability to manipulate its hosts' reproduction and to impede the replication and dissemination of arboviruses and other pathogens within haematophagous arthropods. In addition  the unexpected presence of Wolbachia in filarial nematodes of medical and veterinary importance has provided an opportunity to target the adult worms of Wuchereria bancrofti  Onchocerca volvulus  and Dirofilaria immitis with safe drugs such as doxycycline. A striking feature of Wolbachia is its phenotypic plasticity between (and sometimes within) hosts  which may be underpinned by its ability to integrate itself into several key processes within eukaryotic cells: oxidative stress  autophagy  and apoptosis. Importantly  despite significant differences in the genomes of arthropod and filarial Wolbachia strains  these nexuses appear to lie on a continuum in different hosts. Here  we consider how iron metabolism may represent a fundamental aspect of host homeostasis that is impacted by Wolbachia infection  connecting disparate pathways ranging from the provision of haem and ATP to programmed cell death  aging  and the recycling of intracellular resources. Depending on how Wolbachia and host cells interact across networks that depend on iron  the gradient between parasitism and mutualism may shift dynamically in some systems  or alternatively  stabilise on one or the other end of the spectrum.,Autophagy_notLIR
The molecular mechanism of mitochondria autophagy in yeast.Mitochondria are critical for supplying energy to the cell  but during catabolism this organelle also produces reactive oxygen species that can cause oxidative damage. Accordingly  quality control of mitochondria is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. It has been assumed that autophagy is the pathway for mitochondrial recycling  and that the selective degradation of mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy) is the primary mechanism for mitochondrial quality control  although there is little experimental evidence to support this idea. Recent studies in yeast identified several mitophagy-related genes and have uncovered components involved in the molecular mechanism and regulation of mitophagy. Similarly  studies of Parkinson disease and reticulocyte maturation reveal that Parkin and Nix  respectively  are required for mitophagy in mammalian cells  and these analyses have revealed important physiological roles for mitophagy. Here  we review the current knowledge on mitophagy  in particular on the molecular mechanism and regulation of mitophagy in yeast. We also discuss some of the differences between yeast and mammalian mitophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates cell survival through NAD+ synthesis in cardiac myocytes.NAD+ acts not only as a cofactor for cellular respiration but also as a substrate for NAD(+)-dependent enzymes  such as Sirt1. The cellular NAD+ synthesis is regulated by both the de novo and the salvage pathways. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Turning on the spotlight--using light to monitor and characterize bacterial effector secretion and translocation.Secretion and translocation of bacterial pathogen effectors into host cells via dedicated secretion machineries like type III secretion systems (T3SSs) or type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) is a key feature employed by pathogens to attack host cells. Innovative fluorescence and imaging approaches have blossomed during recent years  and became instrumental in revealing the dynamics of effector secretion and function in interfering with host cellular processes  particularly signaling events  gene expression regulation  membrane trafficking  and autophagy. Furthermore  imaging-based screening approaches have demonstrated the mode of action of several bacterial effectors upon host cellular translocation. The rapid technological advancement of imaging technologies indicates that these techniques will continue to be at the center of numerous future breakthroughs delineating the dynamic processes of bacterial effector actions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of nonsense-mediated RNA decay activates autophagy.Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an mRNA surveillance mechanism which rapidly degrades select cytoplasmic mRNAs. We and others have shown that NMD is a dynamically regulated process inhibited by amino acid deprivation  hypoxia  and other cellular stresses commonly generated by the tumor microenvironment. This inhibition of NMD can result in the accumulation of misfolded  mutated  and aggregated proteins  but how cells adapt to these aberrant proteins is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of NMD activates autophagy  an established protein surveillance mechanism  both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely  the hyperactivation of NMD blunts the induction of autophagy in response to a variety of cellular stresses. The regulation of autophagy by NMD is due  in part  to stabilization of the documented NMD target ATF4. NMD inhibition increases intracellular amino acids  a hallmark of autophagy  and the concomitant inhibition of autophagy and NMD  either molecularly or pharmacologically  leads to synergistic cell death. Together these studies indicate that autophagy is an adaptive response to NMD inhibition and uncover a novel relationship between an mRNA surveillance system and a protein surveillance system  with important implications for the treatment of cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
ATG5: a distinct role in the nucleus.Both apoptotic and autophagic pathways are activated in cells during anticancer treatment using DNA-damaging agents. Thus  the outcome is balanced between apoptotic cell death and enhanced autophagy  with the possibility of prolonged cell survival. It seems intuitively obvious that this survival mechanism might interfere with the desired tumor cell killing. We addressed this question by tipping the balance in favor of autophagy  using etoposide or cisplatin at low  sublethal doses. Over 4 days  only a little apoptosis was observed  but both drugs sharply increased autophagic flux. Surprisingly  cells underwent a cell cycle arrest at G 2/M  followed later by mitotic catastrophe with formation of multipolar spindles  missegregated chromosomes  or enlarged  irregular  sometimes multiple nuclei. Why? The answer is that even a low level of DNA damage not only upregulates autophagy  but also provokes the recruitment of an autophagy-related protein  ATG5  to the nucleus  where it binds BIRC5/survivin  thereby interfering with correct assembly of the chromosome passenger complex needed for cytokinesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Characterization of growth suppressive functions of a splice variant of cyclin D2.We have recently cloned a novel splice variant of cyclin D2 termed as cycD2SV. CycD2SV overexpression in several immortalized cell lines led to formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates accompanied by a significant decrease in cell proliferation. Based on immuno co-localization and ultrastructural analysis experiments  cycD2SV protein aggregates were frequently found in various subcellular compartments such as endosomes  autophagosomes  lysosomes and the microtubule organizing centre. Secondary structure analysis revealed that the amino terminal α-helix in cycD2SV is not tightly packed with the cyclin box suggesting a misfolded conformation compared to other cyclins. Deletion analysis suggests that 1-53 amino acid region of cycD2SV may be required for protein aggregation and 54-136 amino acid region may mediate cell cycle inhibition. Based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments  we have shown that cycD2SV binds to cycD2 as well as CDK4. In addition  gene expression analysis demonstrated an upregulation in GADD45α and dynamin 2 mRNA levels in cycD2SV overexpressing cells. These two proteins are known to play critical roles in the DNA damage response and apoptosis pathways. TUNEL experiments were negative for apoptosis  however  cycD2SV expressing cells were more sensitive to cell death induced by external stressors such as trypsinization. Collectively our results suggest that cycD2SV mediates cell cycle inhibition by sequestering endogenous cell cycle proteins  such as cycD2 and CDK4  and possibly targeting them for ubiquitin mediated protein degradation.,Autophagy_notLIR

Proline oxidase promotes tumor cell survival in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.Proline is a readily released stress substrate that can be metabolized by proline oxidase (POX) to generate either reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce apoptosis or autophagy or ATP during times of nutrient stress. However  the contribution of proline metabolism to tumorigenesis in hypoxic microenvironments has not been explored. In this study  we investigated the different functions of POX under hypoxia and glucose depletion. We found that hypoxia induced POX expression in cancer cells in vitro and that POX upregulation colocalized with hypoxic tissues in vivo. In addition  the combination of hypoxia and low glucose showed additive effects on POX expression. Similar to conditions of low glucose  hypoxia-mediated POX induction was dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase activation but was independent of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Under low-glucose and combined low-glucose and hypoxic conditions  proline catabolized by POX was used preferentially for ATP production  whereas under hypoxia  POX mediated autophagic signaling for survival by generating ROS. Although the specific mechanism was different for hypoxia and glucose deprivation  POX consistently contributed to tumor cell survival under these conditions. Together  our findings offer new insights into the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells present within a hostile microenvironment and suggest that proline metabolism is a potential target for cancer therapeutics.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quantitative changes in the lysosomal vacuolar system of rat hepatocytes during short-term starvation. A morphometric analysis with special reference to macro- and microautophagy.Ultrastructural morphometric analysis was used to study time-dependent variations in macro- and microautophagy in rat hepatocytes. Except during periods of short-term starvation for up to 24 h  animals were kept under standardized conditions of food intake. In hepatocytes of meal-fed rats the volume fraction of macroautophagic vacuoles is significantly higher at 23:00 h  i.e.  immediately before food intake  compared to 11:00 h  i.e.  12 h following feeding. During fasting  macroautophagy drops to a low level. Microautophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes of meal-fed rats  sacrificed at 11:00 or 23:00 h respectively  do not show any significant quantitative differences. However  during 12 h of starvation  the volume fraction of microautophagic vacuoles rises significantly  whereas the numerical density remains constant. Subsequently  during the second 12-h period of fasting  the volume fraction of microautophagic vacuoles remains unchanged  but the numerical density increases. Over a period of 24 h of starvation the volume fraction of the total lysosomal system does not change significantly  whereas the numerical density rises. The time-dependent changes of the macroautophagic vacuolar system correlate with the circadian  food-related variations in the protein content of individual hepatocytes from meal-fed animals. The increase in volume fraction and thereafter in number of microautophagic vacuoles  as observed during starvation  coincides with a large decrease in protein content of individual hepatocytes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in aging and Alzheimer's disease: pathologic or protective?Some hypothesize that aging in humans is a cumulative process of macromolecular and mitochondrial damage starting years  even decades before any symptoms arise. Aging may begin when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of continual repair and turnover. Quality control for damaged mitochondria entails cellular digestion by mitophagy  a specialized kind of autophagy. Insufficient protective autophagy could cause damaged cellular components to accumulate over many years until they affect normal function in the cell. Alternatively  aging could be the result of overactive  pathologic autophagy. Current knowledge supports both hypotheses with conflicting data  depending on which stage of autophagy is examined. To distinguish these opposite hypotheses  two criteria need to be observed. First  is there a buildup of undigested waste that can be removed by stimulation of autophagy? Or second  if autophagy is overactive  does inhibition of autophagy rescue cell  organ and organism demise. Both of these are best determined by rate measures rather than measures at a single time point. Here  we review the generalized process of autophagy  with a focus on the limited information available for neuron mitophagy  aging  and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In two mouse models  treatment with rapamycin abolishes the AD pathology and reverses memory deficits. As a working model  we hypothesize that insufficient protective autophagy accelerates both aging and AD pathology  possibly caused by defects in autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Interaction of the HOPS complex with Syntaxin 17 mediates autophagosome clearance in Drosophila.Homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) is a tethering complex required for trafficking to the vacuole/lysosome in yeast. Specific interaction of HOPS with certain SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins ensures the fusion of appropriate vesicles. HOPS function is less well characterized in metazoans. We show that all six HOPS subunits (Vps11 [vacuolar protein sorting 11]/CG32350  Vps18/Dor  Vps16A  Vps33A/Car  Vps39/CG7146  and Vps41/Lt) are required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in Drosophila. Loss of these genes results in large-scale accumulation of autophagosomes and blocks autophagic degradation under basal  starvation-induced  and developmental conditions. We find that HOPS colocalizes and interacts with Syntaxin 17 (Syx17)  the recently identified autophagosomal SNARE required for fusion in Drosophila and mammals  suggesting their association is critical during tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. HOPS  but not Syx17  is also required for endocytic down-regulation of Notch and Boss in developing eyes and for proper trafficking to lysosomes and eye pigment granules. We also show that the formation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes is largely unaffected in null mutants of Vps38/UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated)  a suggested binding partner of HOPS in mammals  while endocytic breakdown and lysosome biogenesis is perturbed. Our results establish the role of HOPS and its likely mechanism of action during autophagy in metazoans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Atg8  a ubiquitin-like protein required for autophagosome formation  mediates membrane tethering and hemifusion.Autophagy involves de novo formation of double membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes  which engulf material to be degraded in lytic compartments. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein required for this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by a ubiquitin-like system. Here  we show using an in vitro system that Atg8 mediates the tethering and hemifusion of membranes  which are evoked by the lipidation of the protein and reversibly modulated by the deconjugation enzyme Atg4. Mutational analyses suggest that membrane tethering and hemifusion observed in vitro represent an authentic function of Atg8 in autophagosome formation in vivo. In addition  electron microscopic analyses indicate that these functions of Atg8 are involved in the expansion of autophagosomal membranes. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the unique membrane dynamics of autophagy and also indicate the functional versatility of ubiquitin-like proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Photodynamic therapy and cell death pathways.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the term used to describe the irradiation of photosensitized cells or tissue with phototoxic consequences. This process can result in the rapid initiation of not only apoptosis  an irreversible death pathway  but also autophagy. The procedures described here are designed to characterize the correlation between the PDT dose vs. survival of cells in vitro  the apoptotic effects of photodamage  and the extent of an autophagic response. These are assessed by clonogenic assays  observation of condensed chromatin characteristic of apoptosis  activation of "executioner" caspases  and the autophagic flux as indicated by comparing accumulation of the LC3-II protein under conditions where processing of autophagosomes is retarded vs. is not retarded.,Autophagy_notLIR
SVCT-2 in breast cancer acts as an indicator for L-ascorbate treatment.L-ascorbate (L-ascorbic acid  vitamin C) clearly has an inhibitory effect on cancer cells. However  the mechanism underlying differential sensitivity of cancer cells from same tissue to L-ascorbate is yet to be clarified. Here  we demonstrate that L-ascorbate has a selective killing effect  which is influenced by sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT-2) in human breast cancer cells. Treatment of human breast cancer cells with L-ascorbate differentially induced cell death  dependent on the SVCT-2 protein level. Moreover  knockdown of endogenous SVCT-2 via RNA interference in breast cancer cells expressing high levels of the protein induced resistance to L-ascorbate treatment  whereas transfection with SVCT-2 expression plasmids led to enhanced L-ascorbate chemosensitivity. Surprisingly  tumor regression by L-ascorbate administration in mice bearing tumor cell xenograft also corresponded to the SVCT-2 protein level. Interestingly  SVCT-2 expression was absent or weak in normal tissues  but strongly detected in tumor samples obtained from breast cancer patients. In addition  enhanced chemosensitivity to L-ascorbate occurred as a result of caspase-independent autophagy  which was mediated by beclin-1 and LC3 II. In addition  treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine  a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger  suppressed the induction of beclin-1 and LC3 II  implying that the differential SVCT-2 protein-dependent L-ascorbate uptake was attributable to intracellular ROS induced by L-ascorbate  subsequently leading to autophagy. These results suggest that functional SVCT-2 sensitizes breast cancer cells to autophagic damage by increasing the L-ascorbate concentration and intracellular ROS production and furthermore  SVCT-2 in breast cancer may act as an indicator for commencing L-ascorbate treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Defective regulation of autophagy upon leucine deprivation reveals a targetable liability of human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo.Autophagy is of increasing interest as a target for cancer therapy. We find that leucine deprivation causes the caspase-dependent apoptotic death of melanoma cells because it fails to appropriately activate autophagy. Hyperactivation of the RAS-MEK pathway  which is common in melanoma  prevents leucine deprivation from inhibiting mTORC1  the main repressor of autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions. In an in vivo tumor xenograft model  the combination of a leucine-free diet and an autophagy inhibitor synergistically suppresses the growth of human melanoma tumors and triggers widespread apoptosis of the cancer cells. Together  our study represents proof of principle that anticancer effects can be obtained with a combination of autophagy inhibition and strategies to deprive tumors of leucine.,Autophagy_notLIR
Osmosensing by integrins in rat liver.Changes in hepatocyte hydration are induced not only by ambient hypo- or hyperosmolarity  but also under isosmotic condition by hormones  substrates  and oxidative stress. The perfused rat liver is a well-established intact organ model with preservation of the three-dimensional hepatocyte anchoring to the extracellular matrix and/or adjacent cells  parenchymal cell polarity  liver cell heterogeneity  acinar construction  and gene expression gradients. Originally  data from the perfused rat liver indicated that changes of cell hydration independent of their origin critically contribute to the control of autophagic proteolysis and canalicular bile acid excretion. Meanwhile  the concept that cell hydration changes trigger signal transduction processes that control metabolism  gene expression  transport  and the susceptibility to stress is well accepted. This chapter summarizes evidence obtained from experiments with the perfused rat liver that integrins are osmosensors in the liver and thereby critically contribute to the Src- and MAP-kinase-dependent inhibition of autophagic proteolysis  stimulation of canalicular taurocholate excretion  and regulatory volume decrease as induced by hypoosmotic swelling. Moreover  integrin-dependent sensing of hepatocyte swelling is essential for signaling and proteolysis inhibition by insulin and glutamine. These findings define a novel role of integrins in insulin and glutamine signaling and set an example for mechanotransduction as an integral part of overall growth factor and nutrient signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nexrutine inhibits survival and induces G1 cell cycle arrest  which is associated with apoptosis or autophagy depending on the breast cancer cell line.Breast cancers that are estrogen receptor (ER) negative or are ER negative with ErbB2/HER-2 overexpression have a poor prognosis  which emphasizes the importance of developing compounds for preventing breast cancer. Nexrutine  an herbal extract from the plant Phellodendron amurense  has been used for centuries in Asian medicine to treat inflammation  gastroenteritis  abdominal pain  and diarrhea. In this study we investigated the anticancer effects of Nexrutine on ER negative breast cancer cell lines that are positive or negative for HER-2. Nexrutine decreased the activities of 2 potential targets of breast cancer  cyclooxygenase (COX)-2  and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). The antiinflammatory effects of Nexrutine were evident with decreased prostaglandin (PG)E2 production  protein expression of microsomal PGE2 synthase (mPGES)  and PPARγ. Nexrutine decreased cell survival and induced a G1 cell cycle arrest in SkBr3 and MDA-MB 231 cells  which were associated with reduced protein expression of Cyclin D1 and cdk2 along with increased protein expression of p21 and p27. The growth-inhibitory effect of Nexrutine was associated with apoptosis in SkBr3 cells and autophagy in MDA-MB231 cells. Based on these findings  we propose that Nexrutine may provide a novel approach for protection against breast cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and cardiometabolic risk factors.Autophagy is an essential cellular pathway by which protein aggregates  long-lived proteins  or defective organelles are sequestered in double membrane vesicles and then degraded upon fusion of those vesicles with lysosomes. Although autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular homeostasis and keeping the cell in a healthy state  this key pathway can become dysregulated in various cardiometabolic disorders  such as; obesity  dyslipidemia  inflammation  and insulin resistance. In these conditions  autophagy may actually worsen the pathological state instead of protecting the cell or organism. In this review  we discuss how dysregulated autophagy may be linked to increases in cardiovascular risk factors  and how manipulation of the autophagic machinery might reduce those risks.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chloroquine enhances temozolomide cytotoxicity in malignant gliomas by blocking autophagy.In a recent clinical trial  patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme benefited from chloroquine (CQ) in combination with conventional therapy (resection  temozolomide [TMZ]  and radiation therapy). In the present study  the authors report the mechanism by which CQ enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ to aid future studies aimed at improving this therapeutic regimen.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of autophagy augments chemotherapy in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.Although cisplatin (DDP)-based adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC)  SACCs have developed resistance to cisplatin  resulting in chemotherapy failure. Autophagy serves as a critical adaptive response  which was increased in tumor cells in chemotherapy. However  the function of autophagy is not clear in SACC. In this study  apoptosis induced by DDP in SACC high metastatic cell line (ACC-M) was revealed using MTT assay  flow cytometry  and caspase-3 immunoblotting. The autophagy activation induced by DDP treatment was measured by transmission electron microscopy  green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 plasmid transfection LC3 immunoblotting and p62 immunoblotting. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or small interference RNA targeting beclin 1 (beclin 1 siRNA) inhibited autophagy and significantly enhanced DDP-induced apoptosis. ACC-M xenografts in nude mice further verified the synergistic effect of DDP and 3-MA. In conclusion  autophagy activation was caused to protect cancer cells from DDP-induced apoptosis and autophagy inhibition could be a promising strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy in SACC.,Autophagy_notLIR
Immunopathology of inflammatory bowel disease.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a complex series of interactions between susceptibility genes  the environment  and the immune system. The host microbiome  as well as viruses and fungi  play important roles in the development of IBD either by causing inflammation directly or indirectly through an altered immune system. New technologies have allowed researchers to be able to quantify the various components of the microbiome  which will allow for future developments in the etiology of IBD. Various components of the mucosal immune system are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD and include intestinal epithelial cells  innate lymphoid cells  cells of the innate (macrophages/monocytes  neutrophils  and dendritic cells) and adaptive (T-cells and B-cells) immune system  and their secreted mediators (cytokines and chemokines). Either a mucosal susceptibility or defect in sampling of gut luminal antigen  possibly through the process of autophagy  leads to activation of innate immune response that may be mediated by enhanced toll-like receptor activity. The antigen presenting cells then mediate the differentiation of naïve T-cells into effector T helper (Th) cells  including Th1  Th2  and Th17  which alter gut homeostasis and lead to IBD. In this review  the effects of these components in the immunopathogenesis of IBD will be discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antiestrogen-binding site ligands induce autophagy in myeloma cells that proceeds through alteration of cholesterol metabolism.Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by the accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite extensive efforts to design drugs targeting tumoral cells and their microenvironment  MM remains an incurable disease for which new therapeutic strategies are needed. We demonstrated here that antiestrogens (AEs) belonging to selective estrogen receptor modulators family induce a caspase-dependent apoptosis and trigger a protective autophagy. Autophagy was recognized by monodansylcadaverin staining  detection of autophagosomes by electronic microscopy  and detection of the cleaved form of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3. Moreover  autophagy was inhibited by drugs such as bafilomycin A1 and 3-methyladenosine. Autophagy was mediated by the binding of AEs to a class of receptors called the antiestrogen binding site (AEBS) different from the classical estrogen nuclear receptors. The binding of specific ligands to the AEBS was accompanied by alteration of cholesterol metabolism and in particular accumulation of sterols: zymostenol or desmosterol depending on the ligand. This was due to the inhibition of the cholesterol-5 6-epoxide hydrolase activity borne by the AEBS. We further showed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway mediated autophagy signaling. Moreover  AEBS ligands restored sensitivity to dexamethasone in resistant MM cells. Since we showed previously that AEs arrest MM tumor growth in xenografted mice  we propose that AEBS ligands may have a potent antimyeloma activity alone or in combination with drugs used in clinic.,Autophagy_notLIR
AMPK and autophagy in glucose/glycogen metabolism.Glucose/glycogen metabolism is a primary metabolic pathway acting on a variety of cellular needs  such as proliferation  growth  and survival against stresses. The multiple regulatory mechanisms underlying a specific metabolic fate have been documented and explained the molecular basis of various pathophysiological conditions  including metabolic disorders and cancers. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been appreciated for many years as a central metabolic regulator to inhibit energy-consuming pathways as well as to activate the compensating energy-producing programs. In fact  glucose starvation is a potent physiological AMPK activating condition  in which AMPK triggers various subsequent metabolic events depending on cells or tissues. Of note  the recent studies show bidirectional interplay between AMPK and glycogen. A growing number of studies have proposed additional level of metabolic regulation by a lysosome-dependent catabolic program  autophagy. Autophagy is a critical degradative pathway not only for maintenance of cellular homeostasis to remove potentially dangerous constituents  such as protein aggregates and dysfunctional subcellular organelles  but also for adaptive responses to metabolic stress  such as nutrient starvation. Importantly  many lines of evidence indicate that autophagy is closely connected with nutrient signaling modules  including AMPK  to fine-tune the metabolic pathways in response to many different cellular cues. In this review  we introduce the studies demonstrating the role of AMPK and autophagy in glucose/glycogen metabolism. Also  we describe the recent advances on their contributions to the metabolic disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Depletion of autophagy-related genes ATG3 and ATG5 in Tenebrio molitor leads to decreased survivability against an intracellular pathogen  Listeria monocytogenes.Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process involved in physiological and developmental processes including cell survival  death  and innate immunity. Homologues of most of 36 originally discovered autophagy-related (ATG) genes in yeast have been characterized in higher eukaryotes including insects. In this study  the homologues of ATG3 (TmATG3) and ATG5 (TmATG5) were isolated from the coleopteran beetle  Tenebrio molitor by expressed sequence tag and RNAseq approaches. The cDNA of TmATG3 and TmATG5 comprise open-reading frame sizes of 963 and 792 bp encoding polypeptides of 320 and 263 amino acid residues  respectively. TmATG3 and TmATG5 mRNA are expressed in all developmental stages  and mainly in fat body and hemocytes of larvae. TmATG3 and TmATG5 showed an overall sequence identity of 58-95% to other insect Atg proteins. There exist clear one-to-one orthologs of TmATG3 and TmATG5 in Tribolium and that they clustered together in the gene tree. Depletion of TmATG3 and TmATG5 by RNA interference led to a significant reduction in survival ability of T. molitor larvae against an intracellular pathogen  Listeria monocytogenes. Six days post-Listeria challenge  the survival rate in the dsEGFP-injected (where EGFP is enhanced green fluorescent protein) control larvae was significantly higher (55%) compared to 4 and 3% for TmATG3 and TmATG5 double-stranded RNA injected larvae  respectively. These data suggested that TmATG3 and TmATG5 may play putative role in mediating autophagy-based clearance of Listeria in T. molitor model.,Autophagy_notLIR
Open and closed HORMAs regulate autophagy initiation.The Atg1/ULK complex functions as the most upstream factor among Atg proteins to initiate autophagy. ATG101 is a constitutive component of the Atg1/ULK complex in most eukaryotes except for budding yeast  and plays an essential role in autophagy; however  the structure and functions of ATG101 were largely unknown. Recently  we determined the crystal structure of fission yeast Atg101 in complex with the closed HORMA domain of Atg13  revealing that Atg101 is also a HORMA protein with an open conformation. These 2 HORMA proteins play essential roles in autophagy initiation through recruiting downstream factors to the autophagosome formation site.,Autophagy_notLIR
p38alpha blockade inhibits colorectal cancer growth in vivo by inducing a switch from HIF1alpha- to FoxO-dependent transcription.Colorectal cancer cell (CRC) fate is governed by an intricate network of signaling pathways  some of which are the direct target of DNA mutations  whereas others are functionally deregulated. As a consequence  cells acquire the ability to grow under nutrients and oxygen shortage conditions. We earlier reported that p38alpha activity is necessary for proliferation and survival of CRCs in a cell type-specific manner and regardless of their phenotype and genotype. Here  we show that p38alpha sustains the expression of HIF1alpha target genes encoding for glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes  and that its inhibition causes a drastic decrease in ATP intracellular levels in CRCs. Prolonged inactivation of p38alpha triggers AMPK-dependent nuclear localization of FoxO3A and subsequent activation of its target genes  leading to autophagy  cell cycle arrest and cell death. In vivo  pharmacological blockade of p38alpha inhibits CRC growth in xenografted nude mice and azoxymethane-treated Apc(Min) mice  achieving both a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect  associated with high nuclear expression of FoxO3A and increased expression of its target genes p21 and PTEN. Hence  inhibition of p38alpha affects the aerobic glycolytic metabolism specific of cancer cells and might be taken advantage of as a therapeutic strategy targeted against CRCs.,Autophagy_notLIR
The EIF4EBP3 translational repressor is a marker of CDC73 tumor suppressor haploinsufficiency in a parathyroid cancer syndrome.Germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene CDC73 confers susceptibility to the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome associated with a high risk of parathyroid malignancy. Inactivating CDC73 mutations have also been implicated in sporadic parathyroid cancer  but are rare in sporadic benign parathyroid tumors. The molecular pathways that distinguish malignant from benign parathyroid transformation remain elusive. We previously showed that a hypomorphic allele of hyrax (hyx)  the Drosophila homolog of CDC73  rescues the loss-of-ventral-eye phenotype of lobe  encoding the fly homolog of Akt1s1/ PRAS40. We report now an interaction between hyx and Tor  a central regulator of cell growth and autophagy  and show that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP)  a translational repressor and effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  is a conserved target of hyx/CDC73. Flies heterozygous for Tor and hyx  but not Mnn1  the homolog of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) tumor suppressor associated with benign parathyroid tumors  are starvation resistant with reduced basal levels of Thor/4E-BP. Human peripheral blood cell levels of EIF4EBP3 were reduced in patients with CDC73  but not MEN1  heterozygosity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated occupancy of EIF4EBP3 by endogenous parafibromin. These results show that EIF4EBP3 is a peripheral marker of CDC73 function distinct from MEN1-regulated pathways  and suggest a model whereby starvation resistance and/or translational de-repression contributes to parathyroid malignant transformation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ampelopsin-induced autophagy protects breast cancer cells from apoptosis through Akt-mTOR pathway via endoplasmic reticulum stress.Our previous study has shown that ampelopsin (AMP)  a flavonol mainly found in Ampelopsis grossedentata  could induce cell death in human breast cancer cells via reactive oxygen species generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. Here  we examined whether autophagy is activated in AMP-treated breast cancer cells and  if so  sought to find the exact role and underlying molecular profile of autophagy in AMP-induced cell death. Our results showed that AMP treatment activated autophagy in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells  as evidenced by the accumulation of autophagosomes  an increase of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta-2 (LC3B-II) and the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II  the degradation of the selective autophagic target p62/SQSTM1  and the formation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 puncta. Blockage of autophagy augmented AMP-induced cell death  suggesting that autophagy has cytoprotective effects. Meanwhile  AMP treatment suppressed Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as evidenced by dose- and time-dependent decrease of the phosphorylation of Akt  mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K)  whereas Akt activator insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pretreatment partially restored Akt-mTOR pathway inhibited by AMP and decreased AMP-inuduced autophagy  signifying that AMP activated autophagy via inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway. Additionally  blocking ER stress not only reduced autophagy induction  but also alleviated inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway induced by AMP  suggesting that activation of ER stress was involved in induction of autophagy and inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway. Taken together  these findings indicate that AMP induces protective autophagy in human breast cancer cells through Akt-mTOR pathway via ER stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
L-asparaginase inhibits invasive and angiogenic activity and induces autophagy in ovarian cancer.Recent work identified L-asparaginase (L-ASP) as a putative therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. We suggest that L-ASP  a dysregulator of glycosylation  would interrupt the local microenvironment  affecting the ovarian cancer cell-endothelial cell interaction and thus angiogenesis without cytotoxic effects. Ovarian cancer cell lines and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were exposed to L-ASP at physiologically attainable concentrations and subjected to analyses of endothelial tube formation  invasion  adhesion and the assessment of sialylated proteins involved in matrix-associated and heterotypic cell adhesion. Marked reduction in HMVEC tube formation in vitro  HMVEC and ovarian cancer cell invasion  and heterotypic cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion was observed (P < 0.05-0.0001). These effects were associated with reduced binding to ß1integrin  activation of FAK  and cell surface sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(x)) expression. No reduction in HMVEC E-selectin expression was seen consistent with the unidirectional inhibitory actions observed. L-ASP concentrations were non-toxic to either ovarian cancer or HMVEC lines in the time frame of the assays. However  early changes of autophagy were observed in both cell types with induction of ATG12  beclin-1  and cleavage of LC-3  indicating cell injury did occur. These data and the known mechanism of action of L-ASP on glycosylation of nascent proteins suggest that L-ASP reduces of ovarian cancer dissemination and progression through modification of its microenvironment. The reduction of ovarian cancer cell surface sLe(x) inhibits interaction with HMVEC and thus HMVEC differentiation into tubes  inhibits interaction with the local matrix reducing invasive behaviour  and causes cell injury initiating autophagy in tumour and vascular cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of Autophagy Contributes to the Angiotensin II-Triggered Apoptosis in a Dopaminergic Neuronal Cell Line.Our recent study indicated that angiotensin II (Ang II)  the main component of renin-angiotensin system  participated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) by triggering the apoptosis of dopaminergic neuronal cells. However  the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study  by using CATH.a cells  a dopaminergic neuronal cell line stably expressing angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R)  we tested the hypothesis that activation of autophagy contributed to the apoptosis triggered by Ang II. We showed that Ang II activated autophagy and triggered apoptosis in CATH.a cells in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly  inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine markedly attenuated the apoptosis caused by Ang II in CATH.a cells. In addition  the Ang II-induced autophagy and subsequent cell apoptosis could be fully abolished by an AT1R antagonist losartan rather than PD1223319  an antagonist for AT2R. Taken together  our study provides the first evidence that Ang II triggers apoptosis via activation of autophagy in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line through an AT1R-mediated manner. These findings have deepened our understanding on the role of Ang II in the pathogenesis of PD and support the use of AT1R antagonists for the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Stanniocalcin 2 alters PERK signalling and reduces cellular injury during cerulein induced pancreatitis in mice.Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is a secreted protein activated by (PKR)-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) signalling under conditions of ER stress in vitro. Over-expression of STC2 in mice leads to a growth-restricted phenotype; however  the physiological function for STC2 has remained elusive. Given the relationship of STC2 to PERK signalling  the objective of this study was to examine the role of STC2 in PERK signalling in vivo.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of autophagy in aging: its essential part in the anti-aging mechanism of caloric restriction.Aging denotes a postmaturational deterioration of cells and organisms with the passage of time  an increased vulnerability to challenges and prevalence of age-associated diseases  and a decreased ability to survive. Causes of this deterioration may be found in an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage and incomplete "housekeeping." Caloric restriction is the most robust anti-aging intervention known so far. Similar beneficial effects on median and maximum life span were obtained by feeding animals a 40%-reduced diet or by every-other-day ad libitum feeding. In both instances  animals are forced to spend a great part of their time in a state of fasting and activated autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved process in eukaryotes  in which the cytoplasm  including excess or aberrant organelles  is sequestered into double-membrane vesicles and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole  for breakdown and eventual recycling of the resulting macromolecules. This process has an essential role in adaptation to fasting and changing environmental conditions  cellular remodeling during development  and accumulation of altered ROS-hypergenerating organelles in older cells. Several pieces of evidence show that autophagy is involved in aging and is an essential part of the anti-aging mechanism of caloric restriction. As an application  intensification of autophagy by the administration of an antilipolytic drug rescued older cells from accumulation of altered mtDNA in less than 6 hours. It is concluded that the pharmacologic intensification of autophagy (PISA treatment) has anti-aging effects and might prove to be a big step toward retardation of aging and prevention of age-associated diseases in humans.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens.Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation. Recent studies have demonstrated that this pathway mediates resistance to pathogens and is targeted for immune evasion by viruses and bacteria. Lysosomal degradation products  including pathogenic determinants  are then surveyed by the adaptive immune system to elicit antigen-specific T cell responses. CD4(+) T helper cells have been shown to recognize nuclear and cytosolic antigens via presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules after autophagy. Furthermore  some sources of natural MHC class II ligands display characteristics of autophagy substrates  and autophagosomes fuse with late endosomes  in which MHC class II loading is thought to occur. Although MHC class II antigen processing via autophagy has so far mainly been described for professional antigen-presenting cells like B cells  macrophages  and dendritic cells  it might be even more important for cells with less endocytic potential  like epithelial cells  when these express MHC class II at sites of inflammation. Therefore  autophagy might contribute to immune surveillance of intracellular pathogens via MHC class II presentation of intracellular pathogen-derived peptides.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Circadian rhythm  the retina and light].The renewal systems in visual cells  disk-shedding and autophagy  exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms  primarily controlled by an ocular oscillator. Many characteristics of these rhythms have been elucidated  but the actual site and nature of the ocular clock are still unknown. Conceivable regulators of the rhythm are the neurohormone melatonin and the putative retinal neurotransmitter dopamine. Furthermore  dopamine might regulate the sensitivity of the retina to light. It is shown that disk-shedding and autophagy have a circadian sensitivity to light input. The magnitude of the light response was greatest at the beginning of the subjective night  i.e.  12 hours out of phase with the endogenous peak. The latency of the light response was shortest at the beginning of the subjective day  when the endogenous rhythms are at their peak. Additionally  the response to drugs known to modify the metabolism of dopamine was analyzed. The light response of both disk-shedding and autophagy were inhibited by the drugs in the subjective night and stimulated in the subjective day. Thus  light as well as drugs can influence the renewal processes in visual cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neurovirulence of varicella and the live attenuated varicella vaccine virus.Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus  which can cause a variety of complications during varicella infections. These range from meningoencephalitis to polyneuritis to retinitis. After primary VZV infection  VZV enters the dorsal root ganglia in a latent state. Reactivation from latency leads to zoster. The velocity of VZV is 13 cm per day  as the virus travels from ganglion to skin. The live attenuated varicella vaccine virus is markedly less neurovirulent than the wild-type virus. Nevertheless  a few cases of herpes zoster due to the vaccine virus have been documented. Usually  herpes zoster occurs in the same arm as the vaccination  often 3 or more years after vaccination. Thus  herpes zoster in a vaccinee often represents a reactivation of vaccine virus that was carried to the cervical dorsal root ganglia from a site of local replication in the arm. Finally  the role of autophagy during VZV infection is discussed. Autophagosome formation is a prominent feature in the skin vesicles during both varicella and herpes zoster. Therefore  autophagy is one of the innate immune mechanisms associated with VZV infection in humans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Methods to monitor chaperone-mediated autophagy.Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective type of autophagy responsible for the lysosomal degradation of soluble cytosolic proteins. In contrast to other forms of autophagy where cargo is sequestered and delivered to lysosomes through membrane fusion/excision  CMA substrates reach the lysosomal lumen after direct translocation across the lysosomal membrane. CMA is part of the cellular quality control systems and as such  essential for the cellular response to stress. CMA activity decreases with age  likely contributing to the accumulation of altered proteins characteristic in tissues from old organisms. Furthermore  impairment of CMA underlies the pathogenesis of certain human pathologies such as neurodegenerative disorders. These findings have drawn renewed attention to CMA and a growing interest in the measurement of changes in CMA activity under different physiological and pathological conditions. In this chapter we review the different experimental approaches used to assess CMA activity both in cells in culture and in different organs from animals.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autoantibodies specific to D4GDI modulate Rho GTPase mediated cytoskeleton remodeling and induce autophagy in T lymphocytes.T lymphocytes from patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) display multiple abnormalities  including increased cell activation  abnormal cell death by apoptosis and impairment of autophagy pathway. In the present study we report the presence of specific antibodies to D4GDI  a small GTPase family inhibitor  in a significant percentage (46%) of SLE patient sera. We also found a significant association between the presence of these autoantibodies and hematologic manifestations occurring in these patients. Investigating the possible implication of anti-D4GDI autoantibodies in SLE pathogenesis or progression  we found that these antibodies were capable of binding D4GDI expressed at the lymphocyte surface and triggering a series of subcellular events  including Rho GTPase activation. These antibodies were also able to induce autophagy in T cells from both healthy donors and SLE patients  but only those negative to these antibodies. We can conclude that anti-D4GDI autoantibodies could be capable of triggering important responses in T cells such as cytoskeleton remodeling and autophagy pathway and that  in SLE patients  the chronic exposure to these specific autoantibodies could lead to the selection of autophagy-resistant T cell clones contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nilotinib reverses loss of dopamine neurons and improves motor behavior via autophagic degradation of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease models.Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder characterized by death of dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN) neurons and brain accumulation of α-synuclein. The tyrosine kinase Abl is activated in neurodegeneration. Here  we show that lentiviral expression of α-synuclein in the mouse SN leads to Abl activation (phosphorylation) and lentiviral Abl expression increases α-synuclein levels  in agreement with Abl activation in PD brains. Administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib decreases Abl activity and ameliorates autophagic clearance of α-synuclein in transgenic and lentiviral gene transfer models. Subcellular fractionation shows accumulation of α-synuclein and hyper-phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) in autophagic vacuoles in α-synuclein expressing brains  but nilotinib enhances protein deposition into the lysosomes. Nilotinib is used for adult leukemia treatment and it enters the brain within US Food and Drug Administration approved doses  leading to autophagic degradation of α-synuclein  protection of SN neurons and amelioration of motor performance. These data suggest that nilotinib may be a therapeutic strategy to degrade α-synuclein in PD and other α-synucleinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA potentiates purvalanol-induced apoptosis in Bax deficient HCT 116 colon cancer cells.The purine-derived analogs  roscovitine and purvalanol are selective synthetic inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) induced cell cycle arrest and lead to apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells. Although a number of studies investigated the molecular mechanism of each CDK inhibitor on apoptotic cell death mechanism with their therapeutic potential  their regulatory role on autophagy is not clarified yet. In this paper  our aim was to investigate molecular mechanism of CDK inhibitors on autophagy and apoptosis in wild type (wt) and Bax deficient HCT 116 cells. Exposure of HCT 116 wt and Bax(-/-) cells to roscovitine or purvalanol for 24h decreased cell viability in dose-dependent manner. However  Bax deficient HCT 116 cells were found more resistant against purvalanol treatment compared to wt cells. We also established that both CDK inhibitors induced apoptosis through activating mitochondria-mediated pathway in caspase-dependent manner regardless of Bax expression in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Concomitantly  we determined that purvalanol was also effective on autophagy in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA treatment enhanced the purvalanol induced apoptotic cell death in HCT 116 Bax(-/-) cells. Our results revealed that mechanistic action of each CDK inhibitor on cell death mechanism differs. While purvalanol treatment activated apoptosis and autophagy in HCT 116 cells  roscovitine was only effective on caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Another important difference between two CDK inhibitors  although roscovitine treatment overcame Bax-mediated drug resistance in HCT 116 cells  purvalanol did not exert same effect.,Autophagy_notLIR
Involvement of ROS in Curcumin-induced Autophagic Cell Death.Many anticancer agents as well as ionizing radiation have been shown to induce autophagy which is originally described as a protein recycling process and recently reported to play a crucial role in various disorders. In HCT116 human colon cancer cells  we found that curcumin  a polyphenolic phytochemical extracted from the plant Curcuma longa  markedly induced the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and degradation of sequestome-1 (SQSTM1) which is a marker of autophagosome degradation. Moreover  we found that curcumin caused GFP-LC3 formation puncta  a marker of autophagosome  and decrease of GFP-LC3 and SQSTM1 protein level in GFP-LC3 expressing HCT116 cells. It was further confirmed that treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide induced increase of LC3 conversion and decrease of GFP-LC3 and SQSTM1 levels  but these changes by curcumin were almost completely blocked in the presence of antioxidant  N-acetylcystein (NAC)  indicating that curcumin leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production  which results in autophagosome development and autolysosomal degradation. In parallel with NAC  SQSTM1 degradation was also diminished by bafilomycin A  a potent inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion  and cell viability assay was further confirmed that cucurmin-induced cell death was partially blocked by bafilomycin A as well as NAC. We also observed that NAC abolished curcumin-induced activation of extracelluar signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)  but not Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). However  the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK seemed to have no effect on the curcumin-induced autophagy  since both the conversion of LC3 protein and SQSTM1 degradation by curcumin was not changed in the presence of NAC. Taken together  our data suggest that curcumin induced ROS production  which resulted in autophagic activation and concomitant cell death in HCT116 human colon cancer cell. However  ROS-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK  but not JNK  might not be involved in the curcumin-induced autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The pseudokinase tribbles homologue-3 plays a crucial role in cannabinoid anticancer action.Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  the major active ingredient of marijuana  and other cannabinoids inhibit tumor growth in animal models of cancer. This effect relies  at least in part  on the up-regulation of several endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins including the pseudokinase tribbles homologue-3 (TRIB3)  which leads in turn to the inhibition of the AKT/mTORC1 axis and the subsequent stimulation of autophagy-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells. Here  we took advantage of the use of cells derived from Trib3-deficient mice to investigate the precise mechanisms by which TRIB3 regulates the anti-cancer action of THC. Our data show that RasV(12)/E1A-transformed embryonic fibroblasts derived from Trib3-deficient mice are resistant to THC-induced cell death. We also show that genetic inactivation of this protein abolishes the ability of THC to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT and several of its downstream targets  including those involved in the regulation of the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) axis. Our data support the idea that THC-induced TRIB3 up-regulation inhibits AKT phosphorylation by regulating the accessibility of AKT to its upstream activatory kinase (the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mTORC2). Finally  we found that tumors generated by inoculation of Trib3-deficient cells in nude mice are resistant to THC anticancer action. Altogether  the observations presented here strongly support that TRIB3 plays a crucial role on THC anti-neoplastic activity.

α1-Adrenergic drugs modulate differentiation and cell death of human erythroleukemia cells through non adrenergic mechanism.Preliminary data showed that α1-adrenergic antagonists induce apoptosis and a switch towards megakaryocytic differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells. To test the hypothesis whether survival and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells are under control of α1-adrenergic signalling  we examined α1-adrenoceptor expression of erythroleukemia cells and compared the in vitro effects of α-adrenergic antagonists with those of agonists. We discovered that α1-adrenergic agonists suppress both erythroid differentiation and growth of erythroleukemia cells concomitant with lipofuscin accumulation  autophagy and necrotic cell death. α1-adrenergic agonists also inhibit the in vitro growth of physiologic hematopoietic progenitors obtained from umbilical cord blood with high selectivity for the erythroid lineage. Interestingly  the observed effects could not be related to α1-adrenoceptors  even though agonists and antagonists displayed opposing effects regarding cellular growth and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells. Our data suggest that the effects of α1-adrenergic drugs are related to a non-adrenoceptor binding site  controlling the fate of erythroid progenitor cells towards differentiation and cell death. Since the observed effects are not mediated through adrenoceptors  the physiologic relevance of our data remains unclear  so far. Nevertheless  the identification of the still unknown binding site(s) might disclose new insights into regulation of erythroid differentiation and cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
The values and limits of an in vitro model of Pompe disease: the best laid schemes o' mice an' men..In Pompe disease  a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder  cardiac and skeletal muscle abnormalities are responsible for premature death and severe weakness. Swollen glycogen-filled lysosomes  the expected pathology  are accompanied in skeletal muscle by a secondary pathology-massive accumulation of autophagic debris-that appears to contribute greatly to the weakness. We have tried to reproduce these defects in murine  Pompe myotubes derived from either primary myoblasts or myoblasts with extended proliferative capacity. The cells accumulated large lysosomes filled with glycogen  but  to our disappointment  did not have autophagic buildup even though basal autophagy was intact. When we suppressed autophagy by knocking down Atg7  we found that glycogen uptake by lysosomes was not affected  suggesting that macroautophagy is not the major pathway for glycogen delivery to lysosomes. But two apparently incidental observations-a peculiar distribution of both microinjected dextran and of small acidic structures adjacent to the interior membrane of large alkalinized glycogen containing lysosomes-raised the possibility that glycogen traffics to the lysosomes by microautophagy or/and by the engulfment of small lysosomes by large ones. The cultured myotubes  therefore  appear to be a useful model for studying the mechanisms involved in glycogen accumulation in Pompe disease and to test substrate deprivation approaches.,Autophagy_notLIR

4-Hydroxytamoxifen induces autophagic death through K-Ras degradation.Tamoxifen is widely used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Recent findings that tamoxifen and its derivative 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) can exert estrogen receptor-independent cytotoxic effects have prompted the initiation of clinical trials to evaluate its use in estrogen receptor-negative malignancies. For example  tamoxifen and OHT exert cytotoxic effects in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) where estrogen is not involved. In this study  we gained insights into the estrogen receptor-independent cytotoxic effects of OHT by studying how it kills MPNST cells. Although caspases were activated following OHT treatment  caspase inhibition provided no protection from OHT-induced death. Rather  OHT-induced death in MPNST cells was associated with autophagic induction and attenuated by genetic inhibition of autophagic vacuole formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that OHT stimulated autophagic degradation of K-Ras  which is critical for survival of MPNST cells. Similarly  we found that OHT induced K-Ras degradation in breast  colon  glioma  and pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings describe a novel mechanism of autophagic death triggered by OHT in tumor cells that may be more broadly useful clinically in cancer treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in lung cancer.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The relatively poor cure rate in lung cancer patients has been associated with a resistance to chemotherapy and radiation that is at least in part related to defects in cellular apoptotic machinery. Exploitation of another form of cell death  autophagy  has the capacity to improve the therapeutic gain of current therapies. In an effort to develop novel treatment strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio for lung cancer  we wish to better understand the role of autophagic cell death for the sensitization of lung cancer. This text reviews the most up to date protocols and techniques for the study of autophagic cell death in lung cancer models. Others may use these techniques as a framework for study within their experimental models.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysosomal interaction of Akt with Phafin2: a critical step in the induction of autophagy.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the gross disposal of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells and dysfunction in this pathway has been associated with human disease. Although the serine threonine kinase Akt is suggested to play a role in this process  little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which Akt induces autophagy. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen  Phafin2 (EAPF or PLEKHF2)  a lysosomal protein with a unique structure of N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain and C-terminal FYVE (Fab 1  YOTB  Vac 1  and EEA1) domain was found to interact with Akt. A sucrose gradient fractionation experiment revealed that both Akt and Phafin2 co-existed in the same lysosome enriched fraction after autophagy induction. Confocal microscopic analysis and BiFC analysis demonstrated that both Akt and Phafin2 accumulate in the lysosome after induction of autophagy. BiFC analysis using PtdIns (3)P interaction defective mutant of Phafin2 demonstrated that lysosomal accumulation of the Akt-Phafin2 complex and subsequent induction of autophagy were lysosomal PtdIns (3)P dependent events. Furthermore  in murine macrophages  both Akt and Phafin2 were required for digestion of fluorescent bacteria and/or LPS-induced autophagy. Taken together  these findings establish that lysosomal accumulation of Akt and Phafin2 is a critical step in the induction of autophagy via an interaction with PtdIns (3)P.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apoptosis-suppressing and autophagy-promoting effects of calpain on oridonin-induced L929 cell death.Calpain  calcium-dependent cysteine protease  is reported here to impose the crucial influence on oridonin-induced L929 cell apoptosis and autophagy. We found that inhibition of calpain increased oridonin-induced Bax activation  cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage  indicating that calpain plays an anti-apoptotic role in oridonin-induced L929 cell apoptosis. To explore this potential anti-apoptotic mechanism  we inhibited calpain and proteasome activity in oridonin-induced L929 cell apoptosis  and discovered that the inducible IkappaBalpha proteolysis was partially blocked by the inhibition of either calpain or proteasome  but completely blocked by the inhibition of both. It demonstrated that calpain and proteasome were two distinct pathways participating in IkappaBalpha degradation. To further study the role of calpain in oridonin-induced L929 cell autophagy  we discovered that calpain inhibitor decreased oridonin-induced autophagy  as well as Beclin 1 activation and the conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II. Moreover  Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA increased oridonin-induced apoptosis. In conclusion  besides suppressing apoptosis  calpain promotes autophagy in oridonin-induced L929 cell death  and inhibition of autophagy might contribute to up-regulation of apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anti-inflammatory Function of High-Density Lipoproteins via Autophagy of IκB Kinase.Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are frequently found decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Aβ secretion and plaque formation depend on autophagy.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease biochemically characterized by aberrant protein aggregation  including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide accumulation. Protein aggregates in the cell are cleared by autophagy  a mechanism impaired in AD. To investigate the role of autophagy in Aβ pathology in vivo  we crossed amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice with mice lacking autophagy in excitatory forebrain neurons obtained by conditional knockout of autophagy-related protein 7. Remarkably  autophagy deficiency drastically reduced extracellular Aβ plaque burden. This reduction of Aβ plaque load was due to inhibition of Aβ secretion  which led to aberrant intraneuronal Aβ accumulation in the perinuclear region. Moreover  autophagy-deficiency-induced neurodegeneration was exacerbated by amyloidosis  which together severely impaired memory. Our results establish a function for autophagy in Aβ metabolism: autophagy influences secretion of Aβ to the extracellular space and thereby directly affects Aβ plaque formation  a pathological hallmark of AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
In yeast  loss of Hog1 leads to osmosensitivity of autophagy.In mammalian liver  proteolysis is regulated by the cellular hydration state in a microtubule- and p38(MAPK) (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent fashion. Osmosensing in liver cells towards proteolysis is achieved by activation of integrin receptors. The yeast orthologue of p38(MAPK) is Hog1 (high-osmolarity glycerol 1)  which is involved in the hyperosmotic-response pathway. Since it is not known whether starvation-induced autophagy in yeast is osmosensitive and whether Hog1 is involved in this process  we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments. The hog1Delta cells exhibited a visible decrease of autophagy in hypo-osmotic and hyperosmotic nitrogen-starvation medium as compared with normo-osmolarity  as determined by GFP (green fluorescent protein)-Atg8 (autophagy-related 8) fluorescence. Western blot analysis of GFP-Atg8 degradation showed that WT (wild-type) cells maintained a stable autophagic activity over a broad osmolarity range  whereas hog1Delta cells showed an impaired autophagic actitivity during hypo- and hyper-osmotic stress. In [3H]leucine-pre-labelled yeast cells  the proteolysis rate was osmodependent only in hog1Delta cells. Neither maturation of pro-aminopeptidase I nor vitality was affected by osmotic stress in either yeast strain. In contrast  rapamycin-dependent autophagy  as measured by degradation of GFP-Atg8  did not significantly respond to hypo-osmotic or hyperosmotic stress in hog1Delta or WT cells. We conclude that Hog1 plays a role in the stabilization machinery of nitrogen-deprivation-induced autophagy in yeast cells during ambient osmolarity changes. This could be an analogy to the p38(MAPK) pathway in mammalian liver  where osmosensing towards p38(MAPK) is required for autophagy regulation by hypo-osmotic or amino-acid-induced cell swelling. A phenotypic difference is observed in rapamycin-induced autophagy  which does not seem to respond to extracellular osmolarity changes in hog1Delta cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Echinococcus granulosus equinus: variation in the germinal layer of murine hydatids and evidence of autophagy.The germinal layer of sterile 9-month-old murine peritoneal cysts of Echinococcus granulosus equinus shows interrelated variation in depth  tissue integrity  metabolic reserves and the number of autophagic lamellar bodies present. These features are similar in large and medium-sized cysts from the same host  whether occurring singly or within cyst masses. Deep germinal layers (greater than 16 micron) are lipid- and glycogen-rich and possess numerous autophagic vacuoles with 6 nm period lamellar stacks asymmetrically disposed peripherally; shallow layers (less than 12 micron)  with indications of degeneration  have depleted metabolic reserves and fewer lamellar bodies. These bodies are formed by smooth endoplasmic reticulum encirclement of small glycogen masses followed by further sequestration  and eventually definition of glycogen particles may be lost. Autophagy of mitochondria and cytoplasmic vesicles also occurs. The presence of lysosomal enzymes within the layer suggests autolysosomal compartmentalization of excess substrate and effete material. Mucopolysaccharide bodies  containing material similar to that exocytosed to form the laminated layer matrix  occur and are formed from fusion and autophagy of Golgi-derived vesicles. These bodies may also develop peripheral 6 nm period lamellar stacks  but of limited depth. Mucopolysaccharide bodies are the dominant feature of the germinal layer of very small cyst-mass cysts in which laminated layer production is considered to be arrested. They thus represent a repository for the unreleased mucopolysaccharide material.,Autophagy_notLIR
TMBIM6 (transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6) enhances autophagy and reduces renal dysfunction in a cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity model.Cyclosporine A (CsA) is widely used as an immunosuppressor in transplantation. Previous studies reported that CsA induces autophagy and that chronic treatment with CsA results in accumulation of autophagosomes and reduced autophagic clearance. Autophagy is a prosurvival process that promotes recovery from acute kidney injury by degrading misfolded proteins produced in the kidney. In the present study  we used TMBIM6-expressing HK-2  human kidney tubular cells (TMBIM6 cells) and Tmbim6 knockout (tmbim6(-/-)) mice. When exposed to CsA  the TMBIM6 cells maintained autophagy activity by preventing autophagosome accumulation. With regard to signaling  PRKKA/AMPK phosphorylation and mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1) expression and its downstream target TFEB (transcription factor EB)  a lysosome biogenesis factor  were regulated in the TMBIM6 cells. Lysosomal activity was highly increased or stably maintained in the presence of TMBIM6. In addition  treatment of tmbim6(-/-) mice with CsA resulted in increased autophagosome formation and decreased lysosome formation and activity. We also found that tmbim6(-/-) mice were susceptible to CsA-induced kidney injury. Taken together  these results indicate that TMBIM6 protects against CsA-induced nephrotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo by inducing autophagy and activating lysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy: a novel guardian of HCV against innate immune response.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that catabolizes intracellular components and maintains cellular homeostasis. Autophagy involves the sequestration of cytoplasmic content within a double-membraned autophagosome  and the fusion of the autophagosome with a lysosome to form an autolysosome for subsequent degradation (Fig. 1A). Autophagy plays a pivotal role in various aspects of cellular responses to stresses  such as nutrient deprivation  damaged organelles  aggregated proteins  exposure to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and pathogen infections. Virus infection often leads to ER stress and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies reveal that virus-induced UPR may activate autophagy to support the virus life cycle. However  the exact roles of the UPR and autophagy in host cell-virus interactions are still enigmatic.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy facilitates ventilator-induced lung injury partly through activation of NF-kappaB pathway.Mechanical ventilation is an important supportive therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) to assist the critically ill patients with respiratory failure. But longer ventilation time has been proven to contribute to the lung injury which has been recognized as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Recently studies have suggested that NF-kappaB signaling pathways may play a critical role in the process of inflammation and autophagy  and autophagy can reduce the damage of VILI partly by activating the NF-kappaB pathways. Thus  we propose that autophagy may facilitate ventilator-induced lung injury partly through activation of NF-kappaB pathway  which might be a new potential therapeutic target for ventilator-induced lung injury. Although the exact mechanism of autophagy and its exact role in the VILI need to be further explored  at least it provides us a potential target in the future prevention of VILI.,Autophagy_notLIR

Simultaneous induction of non-canonical autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells by ROS-dependent ERK and JNK activation.Chemotherapy-induced reduction in tumor load is a function of apoptotic cell death  orchestrated by intracellular caspases. However  the effectiveness of these therapies is compromised by mutations affecting specific genes  controlling and/or regulating apoptotic signaling. Therefore  it is desirable to identify novel pathways of cell death  which could function in tandem with or in the absence of efficient apoptotic machinery. In this regard  recent evidence supports the existence of a novel cell death pathway termed autophagy  which is activated upon growth factor deprivation or exposure to genotoxic compounds. The functional relevance of this pathway in terms of its ability to serve as a stress response or a truly death effector mechanism is still in question; however  reports indicate that autophagy is a specialized form of cell death under certain conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Does autophagy worsen or improve the survival of dopaminergic neurons?In eukaryotic cells intracellular components are mainly degraded by autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Autophagy is more flexible compared with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and it is involved in the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles  such as mitochondria  which cannot be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome. Although autophagy is able to compensate for ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction  the opposite does not occur. Autophagy is frequently involved in neurodegeneration; however  there is no consensus on its role in cell survival  as it can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. With respect to dopaminergic neurons  there is evidence that autophagy occurs during damage to substantia nigra neurons such as in Parkinson's disease. Moreover  a variety of inherited forms of Parkinson's disease are characterized by mutated proteins that belong to the autophagy pathway. Inhibition of autophagy precipitates dopaminergic cell death  whereas autophagy activation rescues the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons induced by proteasome inhibitors. Taken together  this evidence suggests that autophagy improves the survival of dopaminergic cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagic degradation of mitochondria in white adipose tissue differentiation.Recent work has revealed that autophagy plays a significant role in the process of white adipocyte differentiation. In both in vitro and in vivo model systems  autophagy inactivation by targeted deletion of essential autophagy genes results in alterations in white adipocyte structure. In both models  postdifferentiation cells exhibit atypical morphology  with many small lipid droplets and large numbers of mitochondria  rather than the single large lipid droplet and relatively few mitochondria observed in normal white adipocytes. The role of autophagy as the primary means of the degradation of mitochondria has long been studied  and it is likely that a deficiency in the degradation of mitochondria contributes to the unusual phenotypes observed in mice with autophagy-deficient adipose tissue  including reduced adiposity  resistance to diet-induced obesity  and increased insulin sensitivity. What is not yet known is whether the process of mitochondria-specific autophagy  often referred to as "mitophagy " is specifically induced during adipogenesis or if a general increase in the nonspecific autophagic degradation of mitochondria plays a role in normal adipose differentiation. Despite remaining questions  these findings not only establish the critical role of autophagy in white adipose tissue development  but also suggest that the manipulation of autophagy in adipose tissue may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for metabolic diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy inhibited Ehrlich ascitic tumor cells apoptosis induced by the nitrostyrene derivative compounds: relationship with cytosolic calcium mobilization.Apoptosis induction is often associated with increased autophagy  indicating interplay between these two important cellular events in cell death and survival. In this study  the programmed cell death and autophagy induced by two nitrostyrene derivative compounds (NTS1 and NTS2) was studied using the tumorigenic Ehrlich ascitic tumor (EAT) cells. EAT cells were highly sensitive to NTS1 and NTS2 cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. NTS1 and NTS2 IC(50) was less than 15.0μM post 12h incubation. Apoptosis was primarily induced by both compounds  as demonstrated by an increase in Annexin-V positive cells  concurrently with cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol and caspase-3 activation. Although cytosolic Ca(2+) mobilization is involved in autophagy as well as apoptosis in response to cellular stress in many cancer cell types  from the two nitrostyrene derivative compounds studied  mainly NTS1 mobilized this ion and disparate autophagy in EAT cells. These results suggest that EAT induced cell death by NTS1 and NTS2 involved a Ca(2+)-dependent and a Ca(2+)-independent pathways  respectively. In accordance with these results  the treatment of EAT cells with 3 methyladenine (3-MA)  an autophagy inhibitor; significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells after NTS1 treatment  suggesting that pharmacological modulation of autophagy augments the NTS1 efficacy. Thus  we denote the importance of studies involving autophagy and apoptosis during pre-clinical studies of new drugs with anticancer properties.,Autophagy_notLIR

IL-10 restricts dendritic cell (DC) growth at the monocyte-to-monocyte-derived DC interface by disrupting anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective autophagic molecular machinery.An evolving premise is that cytoprotective autophagy responses are essential to monocyte-macrophage differentiation. Whether autophagy functions similarly during the monocyte-to-dendritic cell (DC) transition is unclear. IL-10  which induces apoptosis in maturing human DCs  has been shown to inhibit starvation-induced autophagy in murine macrophage cell lines. Based on the strict requirement that Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptotic processes are implemented during the monocyte-to-DC transition  we hypothesized that cytoprotective autophagy responses also operate at the monocyte-DC interface and that IL-10 inhibits both anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective autophagy responses at this critical juncture. In support of our premise  we show that levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and autophagy-associated LC3 and Beclin-1 proteins are coincidentally upregulated during the monocyte-to-DC transition. Autophagy was substantiated by increased autophagosome visualization after bafilomycin treatment. Moreover  the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA restricted DC differentiation by prompting apoptosis. IL-10 implemented apoptosis that was coincidentally associated with reduced levels of Bcl-2 and widespread disruption of the autophagic flux. During peak apoptosis  IL-10 produced the death of newly committed DCs. However  cells surviving the IL-10 apoptotic schedule were highly phagocytic macrophage-like cells displaying reduced capacity to stimulate allogeneic naïve T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction  increased levels of LC3  and mature autophagosomes. Thus  IL-10's negative control of DC-driven adaptive immunity at the monocyte-DC interface includes disruption of coordinately regulated molecular networks involved in pro-survival autophagy and anti-apoptotic responses.,Autophagy_notLIR
p53 and autophagy contribute to dasatinib resistance in primary CLL lymphocytes.B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults and there is no cure for the disease. Although dasatinib is cytotoxic to primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro  the drug has been shown to be active in a small percent of CLL patients. Our previous results suggest that dasatinib targets del17 CLL lymphocytes which are the CLL patients with the worst prognosis. Here we present mechanistic evidence that dasatinib induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy in CLL lymphocytes. Furthermore we provide evidence suggesting that autophagy mediates resistance to the drugs  process that is modulated by p53.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy: an affair of the heart.Whether an element of routine housekeeping or in the setting of imminent disaster  it is a good idea to get one's affairs in order. Autophagy  the process of recycling organelles and protein aggregates  is a basal homeostatic process and an evolutionarily conserved response to starvation and other forms of metabolic stress. Our understanding of the role of autophagy in the heart is changing rapidly as new information becomes available. This review examines the role of autophagy in the heart in the setting of cardioprotection  hypertrophy  and heart failure. Contradictory findings are reconciled in light of recent developments. The preponderance of evidence favors a beneficial role for autophagy in the heart under most conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Distinct roles for the p53-like transcription factor XprG and autophagy genes in the response to starvation.Autophagy and autolysis are two cannibalistic pathways which allow filamentous fungi to obtain nutrients once environmental nutrient sources are exhausted. In Aspergillus nidulans  the effects of mutations in two key autophagy genes  atgA  the ATG1 ortholog  and atgH  the ATG8 ortholog  were compared with mutations in xprG  which encodes a transcriptional activator that plays a key role in autolysis. The anti-fungal drug rapamycin induces autophagy in a range of organisms. Mutations in atgA and atgH did not alter sensitivity to rapamycin  which inhibits growth and asexual spore production (conidiation)  indicating that autophagy is not required for rapamycin sensitivity in A. nidulans. In contrast  inhibition of conidiation by rapamcyin was partially suppressed by the xprG1 gain-of-function mutation  indicating that XprG acts in the pathway(s) affected by rapamycin. It was anticipated that the absence of an intact autophagy pathway would accelerate the response to starvation. However  extracellular and intracellular protease production in response to carbon or nitrogen starvation was not increased in the atgAΔ and atgHΔ mutants  and the onset of autolysis was not accelerated. Compared to wild-type strains and the xprGΔ and xprG1 mutants  conidiation of the autophagy mutants was reduced in carbon- or nitrogen-limiting conditions but not during growth on nutrient-sufficient medium. Nuclear localization of the global nitrogen regulator AreA in response to nitrogen starvation was blocked in the xprG2 loss-of-function mutant  but not in the atgHΔ mutant. Conversely  the atgAΔ mutation but not the xprGΔ mutation prevented vacuolar accumulation of GFP-AtgH  a hallmark of autophagy. These results indicate that in A. nidulans there is little interaction between autophagy and autolysis and the two pathways are activated in parallel during starvation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy is required for CSF-1-induced macrophagic differentiation and acquisition of phagocytic functions.Autophagy is the process by which superfluous or damaged macromolecules or organelles are degraded by the lysosome. Pharmacologic and genetic evidence indicates that autophagy plays pleiotropic functions in cellular homeostasis  development  survival  and differentiation. The differentiation of human blood monocytes into macrophages is a caspase-dependent process when triggered ex vivo by colony stimulating factor-1. We show here  using pharmacologic inhibitors  siRNA approaches  and Atg7-/- mice  that autophagy initiated by ULK1 is required for proper colony stimulating factor-1-driven differentiation of human and murine monocytes. We also unravel a role for autophagy in macrophage acquisition of phagocytic functions. Collectively  these findings highlight an unexpected and essential role of autophagy during monocyte differentiation and acquisition of macrophage functions.,Autophagy_notLIR

Hepatic autophagy and intracellular ATP. A morphometric study.In order to estimate the sensitivity of macroautophagy in liver toward changes in ATP we have analyzed the volume density of the autophagic/lysosomal system in isolated rat hepatocytes  incubated under conditions where intracellular ATP was partially depleted. (a) It appeared that reduction of the intracellular ATP concentration by 30-50% decreased the volume density of autophagic vacuoles by 70%. (b) Partial ATP depletion did not involve significant changes in the volume density of dense bodies. Together with studies showing that the rate of overall proteolysis via macroautophagy decreases with decreasing ATP concentration (P.J.A.M. Plomp  E.J. Wolvetang  A.K. Groen  A.J. Meijer  P.B.

Hexokinase II inhibitor  3-BrPA induced autophagy by stimulating ROS formation in human breast cancer cells.Hexokinase II (HKII)  a key enzyme of glycolysis  is widely over-expressed in cancer cells. 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA)  an inhibitor of HK II  has been proposed as a specific antitumor agent. Autophagy is a process that regulates the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. Autophagy in mammalian systems occurs under basal conditions and can be stimulated by stresses  including starvation  oxidative stress. Therefore  we hypothesized that 3-BrPA could induce autophagy. In the present study  we explored the mechanism of 3-BrPA and its combined action with chloroquine. Our results demonstrate that in MDA-MB-435 and in MDA-MB-231 cells  3-BrPA induces autophagy  which can be inhibited by chloroquine. Furthermore  the combined treatment synergistically decreased the number of viable cells. Interestingly  the combined treatment triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells  while it induced necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. ROS mediated cell death when 3-BrPA and CQ were co-administered. Finally  CQ enhanced the anticancer efficacy of 3-BrPA in vivo. Collectively  our results show that 3-BrPA triggers autophagy  increasing breast cancer cell resistance to 3-BrPA treatment and that CQ enhanced 3-BrPA-induced cell death in breast cancer cells by stimulating ROS formation. Thus  inhibition of autophagy may be an innovative strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.human skeletal muscle. Efficient Mirk depletion in SU86.86 pancreatic cancer cells by an inducible shRNA decreased expression of eight antioxidant genes. Thus both cancer cells and differentiated myotubes utilize Mirk kinase to relieve oxidative stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sorafenib induces apoptosis and autophagy in prostate cancer cells in vitro.The multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has recently demonstrated clinical effects in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. These observations provided the rational for investigating the anti-tumoral properties of this compound on prostate cancer cell lines at the molecular level. Two hormone refractory (PC3 and DU145) and one hormone responsive cell line (22Rv1) were used. By use of a panel of cell biology techniques such as immunoblotting  flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry  effects on the MAPK pathway and induction of apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated. We demonstrate that sorafenib reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner  induced apoptosis and inactivated the MAPK pathway. Moreover  we show for the first time  that sorafenib treatment of prostate cancer cells also induces cellular autophagy. This feature is in accordance with the anticancer potential of sorafenib and adds another important effector mechanism of this compound. These observations may open potentially interesting treatment combinations that may augment the effect of sorafenib  either by drugs that promote autophagy such as the rapalogues  or by combining sorafenib with compounds that specifically inhibit the autophagic process.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sea urchin embryos as a model system for studying autophagy induced by cadmium stress.It is well known that sea urchin embryos are able to activate different defense strategies against stress. We previously demonstrated that cadmium treatment triggers the accumulation of metal in embryonic cells and the activation of defense systems depending on concentration and exposure time  through the synthesis of heat shock proteins and/or the initiation of apoptosis. Here we show that Paracentrotus lividus embryos exposed to Cd adopt autophagy as an additional stratagem to safeguard the developmental program. At present  there are no data focusing on the role of this process in embryo development of marine organisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
Truncating mutation in the autophagy gene UVRAG confers oncogenic properties and chemosensitivity in colorectal cancers.Autophagy-related factors are implicated in metabolic adaptation and cancer metastasis. However  the role of autophagy factors in cancer progression and their effect in treatment response remain largely elusive. Recent studies have shown that UVRAG  a key autophagic tumour suppressor  is mutated in common human cancers. Here we demonstrate that the cancer-related UVRAG frameshift (FS)  which does not result in a null mutation  is expressed as a truncated UVRAG(FS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI)  and promotes tumorigenesis. UVRAG(FS) abrogates the normal functions of UVRAG  including autophagy  in a dominant-negative manner. Furthermore  expression of UVRAG(FS) can trigger CRC metastatic spread through Rac1 activation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  independently of autophagy. Interestingly  UVRAG(FS) expression renders cells more sensitive to standard chemotherapy regimen due to a DNA repair defect. These results identify UVRAG as a new MSI target gene and provide a mechanism for UVRAG participation in CRC pathogenesis and treatment response.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of stress mediated cell death by human lactate dehydrogenase B in yeast.We report the identification of human L- lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) as a novel Bax suppressor. Yeast heterologously expressing LDHB is also resistant to the lethal effects of copper indicating that it is a general suppressor of stress mediated cell death. To identify potential LDHB targets  LDHB was expressed in yeast mutants defective in apoptosis  necrosis and autophagy. The absence of functional PCD regulators including MCA1  YBH3  cyclophilin (CPR3) and VMA3  as well as the absence of the pro-survival autophagic pathway (ATG1 7) did not interfere with the LDHB mediated protection against copper indicating that LDHB functions independently of known PCD regulators or by simply blocking or stimulating a common PCD promoting or inhibitory pathway. Measurements of lactate levels revealed that short-term copper stress (1.6 mM  4 h)  does not increase intracellular levels of lactate  instead a three-fold increase in extracellular lactate was observed. Thus  yeast cells resemble mammalian cells where different stresses are known to lead to increased lactate production leading to lactic acidosis. In agreement with this  we found that the addition of exogenous lactic acid to growth media was sufficient to induce cell death that could be inhibited by the expression of LDHB. Taken together our results suggest that lactate dehydrogenase is a general suppressor of PCD in yeast.,Autophagy_notLIR
Endogenous recovery after brain damage: molecular mechanisms that balance neuronal life/death fate.Neuronal survival depends on multiple factors that comprise a well-fueled energy metabolism  trophic input  clearance of toxic substances  appropriate redox environment  integrity of blood-brain barrier  suppression of programmed cell death pathways and cell cycle arrest. Disturbances of brain homeostasis lead to acute or chronic alterations that might ultimately cause neuronal death with consequent impairment of neurological function. Although we understand most of these processes well when they occur independently from one another  we still lack a clear grasp of the concerted cellular and molecular mechanisms activated upon neuronal damage that intervene in protecting damaged neurons from death. In this review  we summarize a handful of endogenously activated mechanisms that balance molecular cues so as to determine whether neurons recover from injury or die. We center our discussion on mechanisms that have been identified to participate in stroke  although we consider different scenarios of chronic neurodegeneration as well. We discuss two central processes that are involved in endogenous repair and that  when not regulated  could lead to tissue damage  namely  trophic support and neuroinflammation. We emphasize the need to construct integrated models of neuronal degeneration and survival that  in the end  converge in neuronal fate after injury. Under neurodegenerative conditions  endogenously activated mechanisms balance out molecular cues that determine whether neurons contend toxicity or die. Many processes involved in endogenous repair may as well lead to tissue damage depending on the strength of stimuli. Signaling mediated by trophic factors and neuroinflammation are examples of these processes as they regulate different mechanisms that mediate neuronal demise including necrosis  apoptosis  necroptosis  pyroptosis and autophagy. In this review  we discuss recent findings on balanced regulation and their involvement in neuronal death.,Autophagy_notLIR

Hijacking components of the cellular secretory pathway for replication of poliovirus RNA.Infection of cells with poliovirus induces a massive intracellular membrane reorganization to form vesicle-like structures where viral RNA replication occurs. The mechanism of membrane remodeling remains unknown  although some observations have implicated components of the cellular secretory and/or autophagy pathways. Recently  we showed that some members of the Arf family of small GTPases  which control secretory trafficking  became membrane-bound after the synthesis of poliovirus proteins in vitro and associated with newly formed membranous RNA replication complexes in infected cells. The recruitment of Arfs to specific target membranes is mediated by a group of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that recycle Arf from its inactive  GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound form. Here we show that two different viral proteins independently recruit different Arf GEFs (GBF1 and BIG1/2) to the new structures that support virus replication. Intracellular Arf-GTP levels increase approximately 4-fold during poliovirus infection. The requirement for these GEFs explains the sensitivity of virus growth to brefeldin A  which can be rescued by the overexpression of GBF1. The recruitment of Arf to membranes via specific GEFs by poliovirus proteins provides an important clue toward identifying cellular pathways utilized by the virus to form its membranous replication complex.,Autophagy_notLIR
Resistance to cellular autophagy by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains.Autophagy represents a key pathway in innate immune defense to restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth inside host macrophages. Induction of autophagy has been shown to promote mycobacterial phagosome acidification and acquisition of lysosomal hydrolases  resulting in the elimination of intracellular M. tuberculosis reference strains such as H37Rv. The notorious Beijing genotype has been previously shown to be hyper-virulent and associated with increased survival in host cells and a high mortality rate in animal models  but the underlying mechanism that renders this family to have such advantages remains unclear. We hypothesize that autophagic control against M. tuberculosis Beijing strains may be altered. Here  we discovered that the Beijing strains can resist autophagic killing by host cells compared with that of the reference strain H37Rv and a strain belonging to the East African Indian genotype. Moreover  we have determined a possible underlying mechanism and found that the greater ability to evade autophagic elimination possessed by the Beijing strains stems from their higher capacity to inhibit autophagolysosome biogenesis upon autophagy induction. In summary  a previously unrecognized ability of the M. tuberculosis Beijing strains to evade host autophagy was identified  which may have important implications for tuberculosis treatment  especially in regions prevalent by the Beijing genotype.,Autophagy_notLIR
Decorin induces mitophagy in breast carcinoma cells via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and mitostatin.Tumor cell mitochondria are key biosynthetic hubs that provide macromolecules for cancer progression and angiogenesis. Soluble decorin protein core  hereafter referred to as decorin  potently attenuated mitochondrial respiratory complexes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. We found a rapid and dynamic interplay between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and the decorin-induced tumor suppressor gene  mitostatin. This interaction stabilized mitostatin mRNA with concurrent accumulation of mitostatin protein. In contrast  siRNA-mediated abrogation of PGC-1α-blocked decorin-evoked stabilization of mitostatin. Mechanistically  PGC-1α bound MITOSTATIN mRNA to achieve rapid stabilization. These processes were orchestrated by the decorin/Met axis  as blocking the Met-tyrosine kinase or knockdown of Met abrogated these responses. Furthermore  depletion of mitostatin blocked decorin- or rapamycin-evoked mitophagy  increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) production  and compromised decorin-evoked VEGFA suppression. Collectively  our findings underscore the complexity of PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis and establish mitostatin as a key regulator of tumor cell mitophagy and angiostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification of cytoskeleton-associated proteins essential for lysosomal stability and survival of human cancer cells.Microtubule-disturbing drugs inhibit lysosomal trafficking and induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization followed by cathepsin-dependent cell death. To identify specific trafficking-related proteins that control cell survival and lysosomal stability  we screened a molecular motor siRNA library in human MCF7 breast cancer cells. SiRNAs targeting four kinesins (KIF11/Eg5  KIF20A  KIF21A  KIF25)  myosin 1G (MYO1G)  myosin heavy chain 1 (MYH1) and tropomyosin 2 (TPM2) were identified as effective inducers of non-apoptotic cell death. The cell death induced by KIF11  KIF21A  KIF25  MYH1 or TPM2 siRNAs was preceded by lysosomal membrane permeabilization  and all identified siRNAs induced several changes in the endo-lysosomal compartment  i.e. increased lysosomal volume (KIF11  KIF20A  KIF25  MYO1G  MYH1)  increased cysteine cathepsin activity (KIF20A  KIF25)  altered lysosomal localization (KIF25  MYH1  TPM2)  increased dextran accumulation (KIF20A)  or reduced autophagic flux (MYO1G  MYH1). Importantly  all seven siRNAs also killed human cervix cancer (HeLa) and osteosarcoma (U-2-OS) cells and sensitized cancer cells to other lysosome-destabilizing treatments  i.e. photo-oxidation  siramesine  etoposide or cisplatin. Similarly to KIF11 siRNA  the KIF11 inhibitor monastrol induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and sensitized several cancer cell lines to siramesine. While KIF11 inhibitors are under clinical development as mitotic blockers  our data reveal a new function for KIF11 in controlling lysosomal stability and introduce six other molecular motors as putative cancer drug targets.,Autophagy_notLIR
Starch binding domain-containing protein 1/genethonin 1 is a novel participant in glycogen metabolism.Stbd1 is a protein of previously unknown function that is most prevalent in liver and muscle  the major sites for storage of the energy reserve glycogen. The protein is predicted to contain a hydrophobic N terminus and a C-terminal CBM20 glycan binding domain. Here  we show that Stbd1 binds to glycogen in vitro and that endogenous Stbd1 locates to perinuclear compartments in cultured mouse FL83B or Rat1 cells. When overexpressed in COSM9 cells  Stbd1 concentrated at enlarged perinuclear structures  co-localized with glycogen  the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1 and the autophagy protein GABARAPL1. Mutant Stbd1 lacking the N-terminal hydrophobic segment had a diffuse distribution throughout the cell. Point mutations in the CBM20 domain did not change the perinuclear localization of Stbd1  but glycogen was no longer concentrated in this compartment. Stable overexpression of glycogen synthase in Rat1WT4 cells resulted in accumulation of glycogen as massive perinuclear deposits  where a large fraction of the detectable Stbd1 co-localized. Starvation of Rat1WT4 cells for glucose resulted in dissipation of the massive glycogen stores into numerous and much smaller glycogen deposits that retained Stbd1. In vitro  in cells  and in animal models  Stbd1 consistently tracked with glycogen. We conclude that Stbd1 is involved in glycogen metabolism by binding to glycogen and anchoring it to membranes  thereby affecting its cellular localization and its intracellular trafficking to lysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR

SIRT1 and SIRT2 inhibition impairs pediatric soft tissue sarcoma growth.Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent deacetylases and/or ADP-ribosyl transferases active on histone and non-histone substrates. The first sirtuin was discovered as a transcriptional repressor of the mating-type-loci (Silent Information Regulator sir2) in the budding yeast  where it was shown to extend yeast lifespan. Seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) have been now identified with distinct subcellular localization  enzymatic activities and substrates. These enzymes regulate cellular processes such as metabolism  cell survival  differentiation  DNA repair and they are implicated in the pathogenesis of solid tumors and leukemias. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of sirtuin expression  activity and inhibition in the survival of pediatric sarcoma cell lines.We have analyzed the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in a series of pediatric sarcoma tumor cell lines and normal cells  and we have evaluated the activity of the sirtuin inhibitor and p53 activator tenovin-6 (Tv6) in synovial sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. We show that SIRT1 is overexpressed in synovial sarcoma biopsies and cell lines in comparison with normal mesenchymal cells. Tv6 induced apoptosis as well as impaired autophagy flux. Using siRNA to knock down SIRT1 and SIRT2  we show that the expression of both proteins is crucial for the survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and that the loss of SIRT1 expression results in a decreased LC3II expression. Our results show that SIRT1 and SIRT2 expressions are crucial for the survival of synovial sarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas  and demonstrate that the pharmacological inhibition of sirtuins impairs the autophagy process and induces tumor cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nutrient modulation of autophagy: implications for inflammatory bowel diseases.During nutrient deprivation  autophagy provides the constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for survival. Recently  genome-wide association studies have identified genetic determinants for susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) such as ATG16L1 and IRGM that are involved in the autophagy pathway. Both disease-carrying NOD2 mutations and ATG16L1 mutations may result in impairment of autophagy. Impairment in autophagy results in impaired clearance of microbes. Ileal CD is associated with Paneth cell loss of function such as decreased production of α-defensins  which may arise from mutations in NOD2 or autophagy genes. Nutrients are able to modify several cellular pathways and in particular autophagy. We summarize the contribution of a variety of dietary components to activate autophagy. Understanding the crosstalk between nutrients and autophagy in the intestine may provide novel targets that have therapeutics potential in intestinal inflammation. Nutrient activation of autophagy may contribute to restoring the Paneth cell loss of function in ileal CD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Intracellular ATP correlates with mode of pexophagy in Pichia pastoris.The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris can degrade peroxisomes selectively though two distinct pexophagic pathways  viz.  micropexophagy and macropexophagy. These micro- and macropexophagy pathways are induced by adaptation of methanol-grown cells to glucose-containing and ethanol-containing media respectively. However  our understanding of the molecular signal(s) that determine which pathway is activated or repressed in response to environmental changes is limited. In this study  the determinant for these pathways was sought using cells undergoing pexophagy under a variety of conditions. Micropexophagy and macropexophagy were distinguished in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. Our results indicate that glucose and ethanol were not specific inducers of micro- and macropexophagy respectively. Micropexophagy was found to be more sensitive to ATP-depletion than macropexophagy  suggesting that the micropexophagic process requires a higher level of ATP than the macropexophagic process. From these and other results  we postulate that intracellular ATP levels play an important role in determining which pexophagic pathway is activated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transglutaminase 2 is involved in autophagosome maturation.Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles. Autophagy occurs at low levels under normal conditions  but it is enhanced in response to stress  e.g. nutrient deprivation  hypoxia  mitochondrial dysfunction and infection. "Tissue" transglutaminase (TG2) accumulates  both in vivo and in vitro  to high levels in cells under stressful conditions. Therefore  in this study  we investigated whether TG2 could also play a role in the autophagic process. To this end  we used TG2 knockout mice and cell lines in which the enzyme was either absent or overexpressed. The ablation of TG2 protein both in vivo and in vitro  resulted in an evident accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 cleaved isoform II (LC3 II) on pre-autophagic vesicles  suggesting a marked induction of autophagy. By contrast  the formation of the acidic vesicular organelles in the same cells was very limited  indicating an impairment of the final maturation of autophagolysosomes. In fact  the treatment of TG2 proficient cells with NH4Cl  to inhibit lysosomal activity  led to a marked accumulation of LC3 II and damaged mitochondria similar to what we observed in TG2-deficient cells. These data indicate a role for TG2-mediated post-translational modifications of proteins in the maturation of autophagosomes accompanied by the accumulation of many damaged mitochondria.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification of small molecules enhancing autophagic function from drug network analysis.Enhancing autophagy is a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of several human disorders. Therefore  there is a great effort in developing drugs modulating autophagy  and various approaches have been taken towards this goal. Gene expression has been considered an important biomarker for drug activity for prediction of drug mode of action. However  the lack of efficient method of analysis has hampered recognition of drug mode of action based on the analysis of gene expression profiles. A novel and robust tool for prediction of drug mode of action and drug repositioning overcomes the limitations of previously available methods. This novel tool is based on a data set of expression profiles derived from a large number of drugs integrated into a "drug network" constructed by comparing the transcriptional responses induced in human cell lines. Automatic analysis of the topology of the drug network makes it possible to classify compounds and to predict unreported effects of well-known drugs. Using this tool  it was possible to identify fasudil as a new enhancer of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Kinetic analysis of autophagosome formation and turnover in primary mouse macrophages.Macrophages enlist autophagy to combat infection by a variety of bacteria  viruses  and parasites. In response to this selective pressure  some pathogenic microbes have acquired strategies to evade or tolerate autophagy. Accordingly  infected cells may accumulate numerous autophagic vacuoles/autophagosomes when microbial products either stimulate their formation or inhibit their maturation. To distinguish between the two mechanisms  we describe methods to assess the impact of infection on the kinetics and amplitude of autophagosome formation and maturation within mouse macrophages by microscopy or Western analysis using antibodies specific for endogenous or recombinant LC3 protein.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial autophagy/mitophagy in the heart.Mitochondrial quality is a crucial determinant of cell viability  and mitochondrial autophagy plays a central role in this control mechanism. Based on studies in yeast  numerous investigations of this process have been conducted  and the framework of mammalian mitochondrial autophagy is progressively appearing. However  many enigmas about the molecular mechanisms involved remain unsolved. Furthermore  the pathological significance of mitochondrial autophagy in the heart remains largely unclear. In this review  we discuss the current understanding of mitochondrial autophagy in mammals with reference to that in yeast. Regarding the process in yeast  some points of uncertainty have arisen. We also summarize recent advances in the research of autophagy and mitochondrial autophagy in the heart. This article is a part of a review series on Autophagy in Health and Disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hexosamine pathway metabolites enhance protein quality control and prolong life.Aging entails a progressive decline in protein homeostasis  which often leads to age-related diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis and maturation for secreted and membrane proteins. Correct folding of ER proteins requires covalent attachment of N-linked glycan oligosaccharides. Here  we report that increased synthesis of N-glycan precursors in the hexosamine pathway improves ER protein homeostasis and extends lifespan in C. elegans. Addition of the N-glycan precursor N-acetylglucosamine to the growth medium slows aging in wild-type animals and alleviates pathology of distinct neurotoxic disease models. Our data suggest that reduced aggregation of metastable proteins and lifespan extension depend on enhanced ER-associated protein degradation  proteasomal activity  and autophagy. Evidently  hexosamine pathway activation or N-acetylglucosamine supplementation induces distinct protein quality control mechanisms  which may allow therapeutic intervention against age-related and proteotoxic diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR

A diffraction-quality protein crystal processed as an autophagic cargo.Crystallization of proteins may occur in the cytosol of a living cell  but how a cell responds to intracellular protein crystallization remains unknown. We developed a variant of coral fluorescent protein that forms diffraction-quality crystals within mammalian cells. This expression system allowed the direct determination of its crystal structure at 2.9 Å  as well as observation of the crystallization process and cellular responses. The micron-sized crystal  which emerged rapidly  was a pure assembly of properly folded β-barrels and was recognized as an autophagic cargo that was transferred to lysosomes via a process involving p62 and LC3. Several lines of evidence indicated that autophagy was not required for crystal nucleation or growth. These findings demonstrate that in vivo protein crystals can provide an experimental model to study chemical catalysis. This knowledge may be beneficial for structural biology studies on normal and disease-related protein aggregation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy occurs within an hour of adenosine triphosphate treatment after nerve cell damage: the neuroprotective effects of adenosine triphosphate against apoptosis.After hypoxia  ischemia  or inflammatory injuries to the central nervous system  the damaged cells release a large amount of adenosine triphosphate  which may cause secondary neuronal death. Autophagy is a form of cell death that also has neuroprotective effects. Cell Counting Kit assay  monodansylcadaverine staining  flow cytometry  western blotting  and real-time PCR were used to determine the effects of exogenous adenosine triphosphate treatment at different concentrations (2  4  6  8  10 mmol/L) over time (1  2  3  and 6 hours) on the apoptosis and autophagy of SH-SY5Y cells. High concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate induced autophagy and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. The enhanced autophagy first appeared  and peaked at 1 hour after treatment with adenosine triphosphate. Cell apoptosis peaked at 3 hours  and persisted through 6 hours. With prolonged exposure to the adenosine triphosphate treatment  the fraction of apoptotic cells increased. These data suggest that the SH-SY5Y neural cells initiated autophagy against apoptosis within an hour of adenosine triphosphate treatment to protect themselves against injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly stem cell (hWJSC) extracts inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro.Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell growth but it is not known whether this effect is specific to only breast cancer cells. We compared the effects of human Wharton's jelly stem cell (hWJSC) extracts [conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM) and cell lysate (hWJSC-CL)] on breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231)  ovarian carcinoma (TOV-112D)  and osteosarcoma (MG-63) cells. The cells were treated with either hWJSC-CM (50%) or hWJSC-CL (15 µg/ml) for 48-72 h and changes in cell morphology  proliferation  cycle  gene expression  migration  and cell death studied. All three cancer cell lines showed cell shrinkage  blebbing  and vacuolations with hWJSC-CL and hWJSC-CM compared to controls. MTT and BrdU assays showed inhibition of cell growth by 2-6% and 30-60%  while Transwell migration assay showed inhibition by 20-26% and 31-46% for hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL  respectively  for all three cancer cell lines. Cell cycle assays showed increases in sub-G1 and G2/M phases for all three cancer cell lines suggestive of apoptosis and metaphase arrest. AnnexinV-FITC and TUNEL positive cells seen in TOV-112D and MDA-MB-231 suggested that inhibition was via apoptosis while the presence of anti-BECLIN1 and anti-LC3B antibodies seen with MG-63 indicated autophagy. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic BAX and downregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2 and SURVIVIN genes were observed in all three cancer cell lines and additionally the autophagy genes (ATG5  ATG7  and BECLIN1) were upregulated in MG-63 cells. hWJSCs possess tumor inhibitory properties that are not specific to breast cancer cells alone and these effects are mediated via agents in its extracts.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cell death by incompatibility in the fungus Podospora.Filamentous fungi are naturally able of somatic fusions. When cells of unlike genotype at specific het loci fuse  non-self recognition operates in the fusion cell and a cell death reaction termed cell death by incompatibility is triggered. In Podospora anserina cell death by incompatibility is characterized by a dramatic vacuolar enlargement  induction of autophagy and cell lysis. Autophagy contributes neither to vacuolar morphological changes nor to cell death but rather protects cells against death. Autophagy could be involved in selective elimination of pro-death signals. Vacuole collapse and cytoplasm acidification might be the cause of cell death by incompatibility.,Autophagy_notLIR
A short polypeptide from the herpes simplex virus type 2 ICP10 gene can induce antigen aggregation and autophagosomal degradation for enhanced immune presentation.It has been reported that certain polypeptides derived from aggregation-prone cellular proteins can turn soluble green fluorescent protein (GFP) into aggregates. Here we report our finding that a short peptide derived from a viral gene  ICP10 of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2  also possesses such a property. A sequence as short as 13 amino acids from the middle region of the gene can convert GFP into an aggregation-prone toxic protein once it is fused to the C terminus. Moreover  this short peptide can direct a surrogate tumor antigen into the autophagosome/lysosome degradation pathway  drastically increasing both MHC class I and class II antigen presentation. The simultaneous induction of both arms of the T cell immune response to the tumor antigen effectively protects the immunized animals from tumor challenge. Designated VIPA (i.e.  viral inducer of protein aggregation)  this unique viral sequence may represent an attractive candidate as a molecular adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy and for other immunologically preventable diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Melanosome abnormalities of ocular pigmented epithelial cells in beagle dogs with hereditary tapetal degeneration.Eyes of laboratory beagle dogs with an inherited tapetal degeneration were abnormally lightly pigmented. The development of pigmentation was followed morphologically from 7 days postnatal to 9 years of age. At all postnatal ages the iris pigmented epithelia contained no normal melanosomes  only organelles resembling secondary lysosomes or residual bodies. The ciliary body pigmented epithelium contained a variety of melanosome organelles at the earliest stages examined  but in fewer numbers than in normal animals. These included premelanosomes  partially melanized and some fully melanized pigment granules. However  the melanin deposition was usually patchy and irregular. With time  many of these granules appeared to condense into residual bodies. The retinal pigmented epithelium in peripheral and inferior posterior regions of affected animals never contained normal appearing melanin granules at any stage of postnatal development. The iris and choroidal stroma had melanosomes of normal size and shape  but many fewer than in normal animals. These results imply that there is local cellular control over melanosome production and regression  since the melanosome abnormalities do not follow the anterior to posterior development of pigment in ocular epithelia. It is proposed that a defect in synthesis of the matrix component of melanosomes could result in absent or abnormal deposition of melanin and initiate a process of autophagy of these organelles.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rationale for using intermittent calorie restriction as a dietary treatment for drug resistant epilepsy.There has been resurgence in the use of dietary treatment  principally the classical ketogenic diet and its variants  for people with epilepsy. These diets generally require significant medical and dietician support. An effective but less restrictive dietary regimen is likely to be more acceptable and more widely used. Calorie-restricted diets appear to produce a range of biochemical and metabolic changes including reduced glucose levels  reduced inflammatory markers  increased sirtuins  increased AMPK signaling  inhibition of mTOR signaling  and increase in autophagy. There are studies in animal seizure models that suggest that these biochemical and metabolic changes may decrease ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. A calorie-restricted diet might be effective in reducing seizures in people with epilepsy. Hence  there is a sufficient rationale to undertake clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of calorie-restricted diets in people with epilepsy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Increased protein aggregation in Zucker diabetic fatty rat brain: identification of key mechanistic targets and the therapeutic application of hydrogen sulfide.Diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration.

Prospective impact of 5-FU in the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress  modulation of GRP78 expression and autophagy in Sk-Hep1 cells.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive malignant diseases and is highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Therefore  HCC requires more effective prevention and treatment strategies. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains the most widely used chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of gastrointestinal  breast  head and neck  and ovarian cancers. In pursuit of a novel effective strategy  we have evaluated the potential of 5-FU to promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in Sk-Hep1 HCC cells. We found that 5-FU profoundly induces ER stress in Sk-Hep1 cells and upregulates p53 and activates CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12. Activation of CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12 promotes mitochondrial cell death in Sk-Hep1 cells followed by ER stress. Changes in calcium homeostasis and the protein folding machinery cause stress in the ER  leading to apoptotic cell death. Stress in the ER activates autophagy to remove the misfolded protein aggregates and recover from the stress environment. Our study demonstrates that 5-FU-induced ER stress suppresses autophagy and also downregulates GRP78 expression. Activation of autophagy followed by ER stress facilitates the cell survival response. Therefore  the inhibition of protective autophagy may provide a useful pharmacological target. Taken together  these results indicate that 5-FU-induced ER stress activates the mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway by downregulating GRP78 and protective autophagy proteins in Sk-Hep1 cells  raising the possibility of using 5-FU as a therapeutic agent to target human HCC.,Autophagy_notLIR
The generation of neutrophils in the bone marrow is controlled by autophagy.Autophagy has been demonstrated to have an essential function in several cellular hematopoietic differentiation processes  for example  the differentiation of reticulocytes. To investigate the role of autophagy in neutrophil granulopoiesis  we studied neutrophils lacking autophagy-related (Atg) 5  a gene encoding a protein essential for autophagosome formation. Using Cre-recombinase mediated gene deletion  Atg5-deficient neutrophils showed no evidence of abnormalities in morphology  granule protein content  apoptosis regulation  migration  or effector functions. In such mice  however  we observed an increased proliferation rate in the neutrophil precursor cells of the bone marrow as well as an accelerated process of neutrophil differentiation  resulting in an accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow  blood  spleen  and lymph nodes. To directly study the role of autophagy in neutrophils  we employed an in vitro model of differentiating neutrophils that allowed modulating the levels of ATG5 expression  or  alternatively  intervening pharmacologically with autophagy-regulating drugs. We could show that autophagic activity correlated inversely with the rate of neutrophil differentiation. Moreover  pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or mTORC1 induced autophagy in neutrophilic precursor cells and blocked their differentiation  suggesting that autophagy is negatively controlled by the p38 MAPK-mTORC1 signaling pathway. On the other hand  we obtained no evidence for an involvement of the PI3K-AKT or ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the regulation of neutrophil differentiation. Taken together  these findings show that  in contrast to erythropoiesis  autophagy is not essential for neutrophil granulopoiesis  having instead a negative impact on the generation of neutrophils. Thus  autophagy and differentiation exhibit a reciprocal regulation by the p38-mTORC1 axis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease: update from the alzgene database and analysis of shared pathways.The genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has taken impressive steps forwards in the last few years. To date  more than six-hundred genes have been linked to the disorder. However  only a minority of them are supported by a sufficient level of evidence. This review focused on such genes and analyzed shared biological pathways. Genetic markers were selected from a web-based collection (Alzgene). For each SNP in the database  it was possible to perform a meta-analysis. The quality of studies was assessed using criteria such as size of research samples  heterogeneity across studies  and protection from publication bias. This produced a list of 15 top-rated genes: APOE  CLU  PICALM  EXOC3L2  BIN1  CR1  SORL1  TNK1  IL8  LDLR  CST3  CHRNB2  SORCS1  TNF  and CCR2. A systematic analysis of gene ontology terms associated with each marker showed that most genes were implicated in cholesterol metabolism  intracellular transport of beta-amyloid precursor  and autophagy of damaged organelles. Moreover  the impact of these genes on complement cascade and cytokine production highlights the role of inflammatory response in AD pathogenesis. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are prominent issues in AD genetics  but they are not specifically featured in the Alzgene database.,Autophagy_notLIR

Epidemiological-molecular evidence of metabolic reprogramming on proliferation  autophagy and cell signaling in pancreas cancer.Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest human cancers with little progress made in survival over the past decades  and 5-year survival usually below 5%. Despite this dismal scenario  progresses have been made in understanding of the underlying tumor biology through among other definition of precursor lesions  delineation of molecular pathways  and advances in genome-wide technology. Further  exploring the relationship between epidemiological risk factors involving metabolic features to that of an altered cancer metabolism may provide the foundation for new therapies. Here we explore how nutrients and caloric intake may influence the KRAS-driven ductal carcinogenesis through mediators of metabolic stress  including autophagy in presence of TP53  advanced glycation end products (AGE) and the receptors (RAGE) and ligands (HMGB1)  as well as glutamine pathways  among others. Effective understanding the cancer metabolism mechanisms in pancreatic cancer may propose new ways of prevention and treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Deletion of ATG5 shows a role of autophagy in salivary homeostatic control.Autophagy is a catabolic pathway utilized to maintain a balance among the synthesis  degradation  and recycling of cellular components  thereby playing a role in cell growth  development  and homeostasis. Previous studies revealed that a conditional knockout of essential member(s) of autophagy in a variety of tissues causes changes in structure and function of these tissues. Acinar cell-specific expression of knocked-in Cre recombinase through control of aquaporin 5 (Aqp5) promoter/enhancer (Aqp5-Cre) allows us to specifically inactivate Atg5  a protein necessary for autophagy  in salivary acinar cells of Atg5(f/f);Aqp5-Cre mice. There was no difference in apoptotic or proliferation levels in salivary glands of Atg5/Cre mice from each genotype. However  H&E staining and electron microscopy studies revealed modestly enlarged acinar cells and accumulated secretory granules in salivary glands of Atg5(f/f);Aqp5-Cre mice. Salivary flow rates and amylase contents of Atg5/Cre mice indicated that acinar-specific inactivation of ATG5 did not alter carbachol-evoked saliva and amylase secretion. Conversely  autophagy intersected with salivary morphological and secretory manifestations induced by isoproterenol administration. These results identified a role for autophagy as a homeostasis control in salivary glands. Collectively  Atg5(f/f);Aqp5-Cre mice would be a useful tool to enhance our understanding of autophagy in adaptive responses following targeted head and neck radiation or Sjögren syndrome.,Autophagy_notLIR
A second report from the EMBO conference on autophagy: mechanism  regulation and selectivity of autophagy.Some key questions being examined in the field of autophagy concern the origin of the membrane that forms the sequestering vesicle  the function of the related machinery  including the identification of new components and binding partners of previously identified autophagy-related proteins and the mechanism of autophagic selectivity. Another general area of intense focus pertains to the physiological role of autophagy and its connection with various pathologies including neurodegeneration  muscle wasting and mitochondrially related diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis].Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a facultative intracellular pathogen with which over a billion people have been infected and 3 million people die annually. The bacterium induces vigorous immune responses  yet evades host immunity  persisting within phagosomes of the infected macrophages. Thus  it is necessary to delineate that the virulence-related intracellular survival mechanism and the host immune responses to eradicate M. tuberculosis on the molecular basis. In this regard  recent findings clearly indicated that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in the recognition of MTB components by macrophages and dendritic cells  resulting in not only activation of innate immunity but also development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. It has been also reported that induction of early death of the infected cells may be one of the strategy of host defense against MTB because macrophages go into apoptosis upon infection with MTB  resulting in suppression of the intracellular replication. Furthermore  recent report has shown that autophagy is induced by IFN-gamma and suppress intracellular survival of mycobacteria  suggesting that activation of autophagy pathway is required to overcome phagosome maturation arrest induced by MTB. In addition  it is known that IFN-gamma plays an important role in protection. The cytokine that is produced from NK cells and dendritic cells at the early period of infection strongly induces not only macrophage activation but also development of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD4+T cells. Since antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and CD1-restricted T cells are also reported to contribute to the protective immunity  cooperation of these T cells is essential for the host resistance. In this paper  I am going to summarize the recent progress of the understanding of protective immunity against MTB.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Autophagy in Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains a major complication of liver resection  transplantation  and hemorrhagic shock. Although the mechanisms that contribute to hepatic I/R are complex and diverse involving the interaction of cell injury in hepatocytes  immune cells  and endothelium  mitochondrial dysfunction is a cardinal event culminating in hepatic reperfusion injury. Mitochondrial autophagy  so-called mitophagy  is a key cellular process that regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and eliminates damaged mitochondria in a timely manner. Growing evidence accumulates that I/R injury is attributed to defective mitophagy. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of autophagy and its role in hepatic I/R injury and highlight the various therapeutic approaches that have been studied to ameliorate injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Comparative pathology of the canine model of glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe's disease).The pathology of canine glycogen storage disease type II (acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency  GSD II) was studied in three genetically related Lapland dogs and compared to the pathology of human GSD II (McKusick 23230). Canine GSD II closely parallels the infantile form of the human disease  except for the presence of oesophageal dilatation. Generalized glycogen storage particularly affected muscular tissues (skeletal  oesophageal  cardiac and smooth muscle). The altered cells showed glycogen accumulation in the cytosol and in autophagic membrane-bound vacuoles (glycogenosomes). They also showed increased acid phosphatase activity consistent with the lysosomal nature of this storage disorder. The cytopathology in canine and human GSD II appears to evolve from segregation of glycogen during regular cellular autophagy  phagolysosomal accumulation of the undigested glycogen  and eventually rupture of distended glycogenosomes. This study indicates that the usefulness of canine GSD II as an animal model of human disease  extends to the area of pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR

The antioxidant function of sestrins is mediated by promotion of autophagic degradation of Keap1 and Nrf2 activation and by inhibition of mTORC1.Sestrins 1 to 3 constitute a family of proteins that are induced in mammalian cells in response to environmental stressors. Despite their apparent lack of intrinsic catalytic antioxidant activity  Sestrins protect cells from oxidative stress by lowering intracellular levels of H2O2. Here we review the mechanisms by which various types of cellular stress induce Sestrin gene transcription as well as those underlying the antioxidant function of these proteins. Several transcriptional factors  including p53  HIF-1  FoxO  C/EBP-β  ATF4  Nrf2  and PGC-1α  contribute directly to the transcriptional activation of Sestrin genes in response to various types of stress. The antioxidant function of Sestrins is mediated by two main pathways. In one pathway  Sestrins promote the p62-dependent autophagic degradation of Keap1 and thereby upregulate Nrf2 signaling and the consequent expression of genes for antioxidant enzymes. In the second pathway  Sestrins block mTORC1 activation and thereby attenuate reactive oxygen species accumulation. This inhibition of mTORC1 activity is achieved either via the AMPK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of TSC2 and consequent inhibition of the GTPase Rheb or via inhibition of the GTPase Rag and consequent prevention of the lysosomal localization of mTORC1 triggered by amino acids. Elucidation of how these pathways operate individually or cooperatively under different stress conditions awaits further study.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ganoderic Acid and Lucidenic Acid (Triterpenoid).Ganoderma species is known as a functional mushroom used in many Asian countries. Triterpenoids  ganoderic acids  and lucidenic acids have been isolated from Ganoderma species (Ganodermataceae family)  such as Ganoderma lucidum. Triterpenoids have been investigated for their biological activities  including antibacterial  antiviral  antitumor  antiosteoclastic differentiation activity  anti-HIV-1  hepatoprotection  antioxidation  antihypertension  cholesterol reduction  and antiaggregation functions. In this chapter  the sources  biosynthesis  biological functions (including cell cytotoxicity  cell apoptosis  cell cycle arrest  anti-invasion  autophagy  anti-inflammation  antiosteoclastogenesis  antiasthma  and antihepatitis B activity)  and pharmacokinetics of lucidenic acids and ganoderic acids are considered in detail here. This chapter briefly summarizes the multiple functions of lucidenic acids and ganoderic acids and their potential for fighting against human diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rheb regulates mitophagy induced by mitochondrial energetic status.Mitophagy has been recently described as a mechanism of elimination of damaged organelles. Although the regulation of the amount of mitochondria is a core issue concerning cellular energy homeostasis  the relationship between mitochondrial degradation and energetic activity has not yet been considered. Here  we report that the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enhances mitochondrial renewal by increasing its degradation rate. Upon high oxidative phosphorylation activity  we found that the small GTPase Rheb is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This mitochondrial localization of Rheb promotes mitophagy through a physical interaction with the mitochondrial autophagic receptor Nix and the autophagosomal protein LC3-II. Thus  Rheb-dependent mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial energy production. Our data suggest that mitochondrial degradation contributes to a bulk renewal of the organelle in order to prevent mitochondrial aging and to maintain the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation.,Autophagy_notLIR
MODULATION OF AUTOPHAGY AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR CANCER THERAPY.Autophagy is a process in which cellular contents are captured in specialized  membrane-bounded vesicles and delivered to lysosomes for final degradation. Most studies support an inherent connection between autophagy and survival  but increasing evidence also suggests an association between autophagy and cell death. The therapeutic potential of targeting the autophagy pathway in cancer seems clear  but specific strategies for achieving successful eradication of cancer cells are less obvious. Recent developments in the fields of autophagy and programmed cell death  nevertheless  have shed light on therapeutic strategies with significant potential. In this review  we provide an overview of the autophagy process  pathways that modulate autophagy  and promising autophagy-based therapeutic strategies for cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Flow cytometric assays for the study of autophagy.The use of flow cytometry to study the autophagic process has recently led to the development of numerous assays measuring various aspects of the autophagic process. These include the detection of the autophagy marker  the microtubule associated protein LC3B  cell cycle analysis of LC3B expression  increase in lysosomal mass  as well as organelle specific autophagy and the measurement of mitochondrial function. We employed a range of autophagy inducing agents to determine the degree of LC3B up-regulation and corresponding cell cycle distribution  increase in lysosomal mass and mitochondrial dysfunction  as well as the relative preference for the specific type of microautophagy or organelle phagy. A variety of autophagy inducing agents were compared these included rapamycin  chloroquine  various nutrient starvation treatments on two cell types  Jurkat T-cell leukaemia and K562 erythromyeloid leukaemia cell lines. Given that numerous autophagy inducing agents cause cell cycle arrest  the cell cycle phase distribution was investigated and LC3B antigen was shown to increase as cells progressed through the cell cycle. LysoTracker dyes have been previously employed to investigate the autophagic process and here the LysoTracker signal increased in autophagic cells in relation to controls. Organelle autophagy of mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)  termed mitophagy and ER phagy was determined flow cytometrically by the employment of organelle mass probes  MitoTracker Green (MTG) and ER Tracker Green (ERTG). A modification of the cell cycle analysis width and area analysis employed for DNA content determinations was developed to show changes in organelle mass on a linear scale. Relative changes in linear scaled median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared to control cells to determine the degree and type of organelle phagy induced by a range of autophagy inducing agents and treatments. These flow cytometric organelle phagy and lysosome mass assays can be used by researchers to study the autophagic process further in terms of cell and mitochondrial functionality over time in a cell dependent manner as an adjunct to LC3B measurements.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction as emerging mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity.The study of the potential risks associated with the manufacture  use  and disposal of nanoscale materials  and their mechanisms of toxicity  is important for the continued advancement of nanotechnology. Currently  the most widely accepted paradigms of nanomaterial toxicity are oxidative stress and inflammation  but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. This review will highlight the significance of autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction as emerging mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity. Most endocytic routes of nanomaterial cell uptake converge upon the lysosome  making the lysosomal compartment the most common intracellular site of nanoparticle sequestration and degradation. In addition to the endo-lysosomal pathway  recent evidence suggests that some nanomaterials can also induce autophagy. Among the many physiological functions  the lysosome  by way of the autophagy (macroautophagy) pathway  degrades intracellular pathogens  and damaged organelles and proteins. Thus  autophagy induction by nanoparticles may be an attempt to degrade what is perceived by the cell as foreign or aberrant. While the autophagy and endo-lysosomal pathways have the potential to influence the disposition of nanomaterials  there is also a growing body of literature suggesting that biopersistent nanomaterials can  in turn  negatively impact these pathways. Indeed  there is ample evidence that biopersistent nanomaterials can cause autophagy and lysosomal dysfunctions resulting in toxicological consequences.,Autophagy_notLIR

AMBRA1: When autophagy meets cell proliferation.A growing amount of evidence reported in the literature in recent years strongly supports the relevance of the interplay between autophagy and other pathways. In this context  the study of the link between autophagy and cell proliferation regulation has been among the most challenging. In our recent publications  we finely characterize a role for the pro-autophagic protein AMBRA1 in the regulation of cell proliferation. AMBRA1 modulates autophagy and interacts with PPP2/PP2A (protein phosphatase 2)  thus also modulating MYC protein levels and the cell proliferation rate. Interestingly  this pathway of regulation is controlled by the master regulator of autophagy and cell growth  MTORC1. Notably  in our study we demonstrate the relevance of the AMBRA1-mediated regulation of MYC in tumorigenesis  also identifying AMBRA1 as a tumor suppressor gene.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genetic variants associated with Crohn's disease.Crohn's disease is an immune-related disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa  which can occur in any area throughout the digestive tract. This life-long disease commonly presents with abdominal pain  diarrhea  vomiting  and weight loss. While the exact etiology of this disease is largely unknown  it is thought to arise from an interaction between microbial  immunological  and environmental factors in a genetically susceptible host  whereby the immune system attacks the intestine as it cross reacts against gut microbial antigens. The study of genetic variants associated with Crohn's disease has shed light on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. A large number of genetic variants identified in Crohn's disease are related to genes targeting microbial recognition and bacterial wall sensing  the most common being NOD2/CARD15 gene. This review will discuss the recent advance in our knowledge of genetic variants of this disease and how they influence the disease course and prognosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inflammatory and cell death pathways in brain and peripheral blood in Parkinson's disease.Evidence has been accumulated showing that inflammatory and cell death pathways are altered both in brain and periphery during Parkinson disease (PD). Neuronal loss in PD is associated with chronic neuroinflammation characterized by microglia activation through the release of reactive oxygen radicals  cytokines  and Prostaglandin E2. The release of these inflammatory mediators in addition to deprivation in growth factors and increase of calcium and dopamine seem implicated in triggering apoptosis. The interaction of leucine-rich repeat kinase and Fas- Associated protein with Death Domain has been implicated in the switching-on of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via caspase-8 activation  while deficiency in PTEN induced putative kinase 1 has been shown to cause Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria  increased generation of reactive oxygen species and intrinsic cell death. Autophagy/mitophagy appears to be impaired in the brain during PD; this impairment could be related to defective degradation of mutant α-synuclein and consequent apoptotic cell death. Regarding the peripheral blood  reduced amounts of dopamine  reduced levels of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine active transporter  and alterations of dopamine receptor expression have been detected in mononuclear cells from PD patients. In addition  mononuclear cells from PD patients show mitochondrial  ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction and up-regulation of α-synuclein gene  associated to high expression of the Fas molecule  activation of caspase-3 and -9 and proneness to apoptosis. These and other observations reported in this mini-review suggest that a better understanding of molecular dysfunctions in inflammatory and cell death/autophagy pathways  both in the brain and peripheral blood  could provide useful targets for future investigation on drug-discovery and biomarker identification in PD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Curvature of double-membrane organelles generated by changes in membrane size and composition.Transient double-membrane organelles are key players in cellular processes such as autophagy  reproduction  and viral infection. These organelles are formed by the bending and closure of flat  double-membrane sheets. Proteins are believed to be important in these morphological transitions but the underlying mechanism of curvature generation is poorly understood. Here  we describe a novel mechanism for this curvature generation which depends primarily on three membrane properties: the lateral size of the double-membrane sheets  the molecular composition of their highly curved rims  and a possible asymmetry between the two flat faces of the sheets. This mechanism is evolutionary advantageous since it does not require active processes and is readily available even when resources within the cell are restricted as during starvation  which can induce autophagy and sporulation. We identify pathways for protein-assisted regulation of curvature generation  organelle size  direction of bending  and morphology. Our theory also provides a mechanism for the stabilization of large double-membrane sheet-like structures found in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi cisternae.,Autophagy_notLIR
HCV infection selectively impairs type I but not type III IFN signaling.A stable and persistent Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cell culture model was developed to examine clearance of viral replication during long-term treatment using interferon-α (IFN-α)  IFN-λ  and ribavirin (RBV). Persistently HCV-infected cell culture exhibited an impaired antiviral response to IFN-α+RBV combination treatment  whereas IFN-λ treatment produced a strong and sustained antiviral response that cleared HCV replication. HCV replication in persistently infected cells induced chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and an autophagy response that selectively down-regulated the functional IFN-α receptor-1 chain of type I  but not type II (IFN-γ) or type III (IFN-λ) IFN receptors. Down-regulation of IFN-α receptor-1 resulted in defective JAK-STAT signaling  impaired STAT phosphorylation  and impaired nuclear translocation of STAT. Furthermore  HCV replication impaired RBV uptake  because of reduced expression of the nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT1. Silencing ER stress and the autophagy response using chemical inhibitors or siRNA additively inhibited HCV replication and induced viral clearance by the IFN-α+RBV combination treatment. These results indicate that HCV induces ER stress and that the autophagy response selectively impairs type I (but not type III) IFN signaling  which explains why IFN-λ (but not IFN-α) produced a sustained antiviral response against HCV. The results also indicate that inhibition of ER stress and of the autophagy response overcomes IFN-α+RBV resistance mechanisms associated with HCV infection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antioxidant supplement inhibits skeletal muscle constitutive autophagy rather than fasting-induced autophagy in mice.In this study  we tested the hypothesis that NAC administration leads to reduced oxidative stress and thus to decreased expression of autophagy markers in young mice. Our results reveal that NAC administration results in reduced muscle mRNA levels of several autophagy markers  including Beclin-1  Atg7  LC3  Atg9  and LAMP2. However  NAC supplement fails to block the activation of skeletal muscle autophagy in response to fasting  because fasting significantly increases the mRNA level of several autophagy markers and LC3 lipidation. We further examined the effects of NAC administration on mitochondrial antioxidant capacity in fed and 24-hour fasted mice. Our results clearly show that NAC administration depresses the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR)  both of which play a predominant antioxidant role in mitochondria by reducing ROS level. In addition  we found no beneficial effect of NAC supplement on muscle mass but it can protect from muscle loss in response to fasting. Collectively  our findings indicate that ROS is required for skeletal muscle constitutive autophagy  rather than starvation-induced autophagy  and that antioxidant NAC inhibits constitutive autophagy by the regulation of mitochondrial ROS production and antioxidant capacity.,Autophagy_notLIR
ERK1/2 is involved in luteal cell autophagy regulation during corpus luteum regression via an mTOR-independent pathway.Autophagy is known to be regulated by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways  leading to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  a major negative regulator of autophagy. However  some reports have also suggested that autophagic regulation by the PI3K-AKT and/or MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways may not be mediated by mTOR activity  and there is no direct evidence of the involvement of these pathways in luteal cell autophagy regulation. To elucidate the luteal cell-specific regulatory mechanisms of autophagy induction during corpus luteum (CL) regression  we evaluated whether luteal cell autophagy is regulated by the PI3K-AKT pathway and/or MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway and if this regulation is mediated by mTOR. We found that autophagy induction increased despite mTOR activation in luteal cells cultured with prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)  an important mediator of CL regression  suggesting that PGF2α-induced autophagy is independent of mTOR regulation. We also found that PGF2α-induced autophagy was not mediated by AKT activity  because AKT inhibition using a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) did not change autophagy induction or mTOR activity. In contrast  ERK1/2 activity increased in PGF2α-treated luteal cells  as did the levels of autophagy induction despite increased mTOR activity. Furthermore  PGF2α-mediated up-regulation of luteal cell autophagy was reversed by addition of ERK1/2 inhibitors  despite a decrease in mTOR activity. These in vitro results suggest that luteal cell autophagy is induced by increased ERK1/2 activity during CL regression  and is independent of mTOR activity. This finding was further supported by in vivo experiments in a pseudo-pregnant rat model  which showed that induction of luteal cell autophagy increased during luteal stage progression and that this was accompanied by increased ERK1/2 and mTOR activity. Taken together  our findings indicate that activation of ERK1/2 is a key event in the induction of luteal cell autophagy during CL regression which is not associated with mTOR regulation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Polyubiquitin chain-dependent protein degradation in TRIM30 cytoplasmic bodies.Viral infection induces numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins to control antiviral immune signaling and viral replication. Particularly  SPRY-containing TRIM proteins are found only in vertebrates and they control target protein degradation by their RING-finger and SPRY domains  and proper cytoplasmic localization. To understand TRIM30 function  we analyzed its localization pattern and putative roles of its RING-finger and SPRY domains. We found that TRIM30 is located in actin-mediated cytoplasmic bodies and produces colocalized ubiquitin chains in SPRY domain- and RING-finger domain-dependent ways that are degraded by autophagy and the proteasome. These results suggest a TRIM protein-dependent degradation mechanism by cytoplasmic body formation with actin networks.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy as a Stress Response Pathway in the Immune System.Macroautophagy  hereafter  referred to as autophagy  has long been regarded as a housekeeping pathway involved in intracellular degradation and energy recycling. These housekeeping and homeostatic functions are especially important during cellular stress  such as periods of nutrient deprivation. However  importance of autophagy extends far beyond its degradative functions. Recent evidence shows that autophagy plays an essential role in development  organization and functions of the immune system  and defects in autophagy lead to several diseases  including cancer and autoimmunity. In the immune system  autophagy is important in regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. This review focuses on the roles of autophagy in the adaptive immune system. We first introduce the autophagy pathway and provide a brief description of the major molecular players involved in autophagy. We then discuss the importance of autophagy as a stress integrator mechanism and provide relevant examples of this role of autophagy in adaptive immune cells. Then we proceed to describe how autophagy regulates development  activation and functions of different adaptive immune cells. In these contexts  we mention both degradative and non-degradative roles of autophagy  and illustrate their importance. We also discuss role of autophagy in antigen presenting cells  which play critical roles in the activation of adaptive immune cells. Further  we describe how autophagy regulates functions of different adaptive immune cells during infection  inflammation and autoimmunity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Skn1 and Ipt1 negatively regulate autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We demonstrated that a yeast deletion mutant in IPT1 and SKN1  encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of mannosyldiinositolphosphoryl ceramides  is characterized by increased autophagy and DNA fragmentation upon nitrogen (N) starvation as compared with the single deletion mutants or wild type (WT). Apoptotic features were not significantly different between single and double deletion mutants upon N starvation  pointing to increased autophagy in the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant independent of apoptosis. We observed increased basal levels of phytosphingosine in membranes of the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant as compared with the single deletion mutants or WT. These data point to a negative regulation of autophagy by both Ipt1 and Skn1 in yeast  with a putative involvement of phytosphingosine in this process.,Autophagy_notLIR
Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3): Novel ligands mediate unexpected functions.In addition to its important role in the regulation of somatic growth by acting as the major circulating transport protein for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)  IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has a variety of intracellular ligands that point to its function within major signaling pathways. The discovery of its interaction with the retinoid X receptor has led to the elucidation of roles in regulating the function of several nuclear hormone receptors including retinoic acid receptor-α  Nur77 and vitamin D receptor. Its interaction with the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ is believed to be involved in regulating adipocyte differentiation  which is also modulated by IGFBP-3 through an interaction with TGFβ/Smad signaling. IGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis alone or in conjunction with other agents  and in different systems can activate caspases -8 and -9. At least two unrelated proteins (LRP1 and TMEM219) have been designated as receptors for IGFBP-3  the latter with a demonstrated role in inducing caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. In contrast  IGFBP-3 also has demonstrated roles in survival-related functions  including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor and DNA-dependent protein kinase  and the induction of autophagy through interaction with GRP78. The ability of IGFBP-3 to modulate the balance between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival sphingolipids by regulating sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingomyelinases may be integral to its role at the crossroads between cell death and survival in response to a variety of stimuli. The pleiotropic nature of IGFBP-3 activity supports the idea that IGFBP-3 itself  or pathways with which it interacts  should be investigated as targets of therapy for a variety of diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of autophagy in the ω-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced death of lung cancer A549 cells.The present study identified that ω-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs)  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) demonstrate anti-proliferative effects in lung cancer A549 cells. MTS and cytotoxicity assays were conducted to confirm that ω-3 PUFAs induced cell death. Autophagy-associated gene and signaling pathways were also detected. Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression was found to be increased subsequent to treatment with DHA and EPA  and the expression of LC3-II was particularly increased. mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence staining and p62 expression levels were used to detect autophagic flux. The present results indicate that DHA and EPA block autophagic flux  suggesting autophagosome accumulation. Subsequent to treatment with DHA and EPA  which interfered with autophagosomes  the expression of Beclin 1 was significantly decreased  while the expression of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin was significantly increased. Therefore  DHA and EPA exert anti-proliferative effects by inhibiting autophagy in A549 cells  which highlights the potential of DHA and EPA for use in the prevention or treatment of lung cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Increased reactive oxygen species  metabolic maladaptation  and autophagy contribute to pulmonary arterial hypertension-induced ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic heart failure.Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating and deadly disease with no known cure. Heart failure is a major comorbidity and a common cause of the premature death of patients with PAH. Increased asymmetrical right ventricular hypertrophy and septal wall thickening compress the left ventricular cavity and elicit diastolic heart failure. In this study  we used the Sugen5416/hypoxia/normoxia-induced PAH rat to determine whether altered pyridine nucleotide signaling in the failing heart contributes to 1) increased oxidative stress  2) changes in metabolic phenotype  3) autophagy  and 4) the PAH-induced failure. We found that increased reactive oxygen species  metabolic maladaptation  and autophagy contributed to the pathogenesis of right ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy that lead to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In addition  arterial elastance increased in PAH rats. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a major source of pyridine molecule (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)  which is a substrate for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases in the heart. Dehydroepiandrosterone  a 17-ketosteroid that reduces pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy  inhibited glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  decreased oxidative stress  increased glucose oxidation and acetyl-coA  and reduced autophagy in the hearts of PAH rats. It also decreased arterial stiffness and improved left ventricular diastolic function. These findings demonstrate that pyridine nucleotide signaling  at least partly  mediates PAH-induced diastolic heart failure  and that reduction of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-derived nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is beneficial to improve left ventricle diastolic function.,Autophagy_notLIR
Conophylline protects cells in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases by inducing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-independent autophagy.Macroautophagy is a cellular response that leads to the bulk  nonspecific degradation of cytosolic components  including organelles. In recent years  it has been recognized that autophagy is essential for prevention of neurodegenerative diseases  including Parkinson disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD). Here  we show that conophylline (CNP)  a vinca alkaloid  induces autophagy in an mammalian target of rapamycin-independent manner. Using a cellular model of PD  CNP suppressed protein aggregation and protected cells from cell death caused by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  a neurotoxin  by inducing autophagy. Moreover  in the HD model  CNP also eliminated mutant huntingtin aggregates. Our findings demonstrate the possible use of CNP as a therapeutic drug for neurodegenerative disorders  including PD and HD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Upregulation of ATG3 contributes to autophagy induced by the detachment of intestinal epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix  but promotes autophagy-independent apoptosis of the attached cells.Detachment of nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers their growth arrest and  ultimately  apoptosis. In contrast  colorectal cancer cells can grow without attachment to the ECM. This ability is critical for their malignant potential. We found previously that detachment-induced growth arrest of nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells is driven by their detachment-triggered autophagy  and that RAS  a major oncogene  promotes growth of detached cells by blocking such autophagy. In an effort to identify the mechanisms of detachment-induced autophagy and growth arrest of nonmalignant cells we found here that detachment of these cells causes upregulation of ATG3 and that ATG3 upregulation contributes to autophagy and growth arrest of detached cells. We also observed that when ATG3 expression is artificially increased in the attached cells  ATG3 promotes neither autophagy nor growth arrest but triggers their apoptosis. ATG3 upregulation likely promotes autophagy of the detached but not that of the attached cells because detachment-dependent autophagy requires other detachment-induced events  such as the upregulation of ATG7. We further observed that those few adherent cells that do not die by apoptosis induced by ATG3 become resistant to apoptosis caused by cell detachment  a property that is critical for the ability of normal epithelial cells to become malignant. We conclude that cell-ECM adhesion can switch ATG3 functions: when upregulated in detached cells in the context of other autophagy-promoting events  ATG3 contributes to autophagy. However  when overexpressed in the adherent cells  in the circumstances not favoring autophagy  ATG3 triggers apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Acute hyperglycemia abolishes cardioprotection by remote ischemic perconditioning.Remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPerC) has a promising therapeutic insight to improve the prognosis of acute myocardial infarction. Chronic comorbidities such as diabetes are known to interfere with conditioning interventions by modulating cardioprotective signaling pathways  such as e.g.  mTOR pathway and autophagy. However  the effect of acute hyperglycemia on RIPerC has not been studied so far. Therefore  here we investigated the effect of acute hyperglycemia on cardioprotection by RIPerC.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of integrin-mediated crosstalk with epidermal growth factor receptor/Erk or Src signaling pathways in autophagic prostate epithelial cells induces caspase-independent death.In vivo in the prostate gland  basal epithelial cells adhere to laminin 5 (LM5) via alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins. When placed in culture primary prostate basal epithelial cells secrete and adhere to their own LM5-rich matrix. Adhesion to LM5 is required for cell survival that is dependent on integrin-mediated  ligand-independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src  but not PI-3K. Integrin-mediated adhesion via alpha3beta1  but not alpha6beta4 integrin  supports cell survival through EGFR by signaling downstream to Erk. PC3 cells  which do not activate EGFR or Erk on LM5-rich matrices  are not dependent on this pathway for survival. PC3 cells are dependent on PI-3K for survival and undergo caspase-dependent death when PI-3K is inhibited. The death induced by inhibition of EGFR or Src in normal primary prostate cells is not mediated through or dependent on caspase activation  but depends on the induction of reactive oxygen species. In addition the presence of an autophagic pathway  maintained by adhesion to matrix through alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4  prevents the induction of caspases when EGFR or Src is inhibited. Suppression of autophagy is sufficient to induce caspase activation and apoptosis in LM5-adherent primary prostate epithelial cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
A role for Rac3 GTPase in the regulation of autophagy.The process of autophagy is situated at the intersection of multiple cell signaling pathways  including cell metabolism  growth  and death  and hence is subject to multiple forms of regulation. We previously reported that inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt)  which catalyzes the final step in the post-translational prenylation of so-called CAAX proteins  results in the induction of autophagy which enhances cell death in some cancer cells. In this study  using siRNA-mediated knockdown of a group of small GTPases that are predicted Icmt substrates  we identify Rac3 GTPase as a negative regulator of the process of autophagy. Knockdown of Rac3  but not the closely related isoforms Rac1 and Rac2  results in induction of autophagy. Ectopic expression of Rac3  significantly rescues cells from autophagy and cell death induced by Icmt inhibition  strengthening the notion of an isoform-specific autophagy regulatory function of Rac3. This role of Rac3 was observed in multiple cell lines with varying Rac subtype expression profiles  suggesting its broad involvement in the process. The identification of this less-studied Rac member as a novel regulator provides new insight into autophagy and opens opportunities in identifying additional regulatory inputs of the process.,Autophagy_notLIR
Physiological functions of autophagy.The field of autophagy research has advanced rapidly in recent years  with important discoveries made in relation to both molecular mechanisms and physiological functions. Initially  autophagy was thought to be primarily a response to starvation. Although this might be true in lower eukaryotes  this catabolic process exerts various physiological functions in higher eukaryotes. This review summarizes the physiological roles of autophagy in amino acid pool maintenance  intracellular quality control  development  cell death  tumor suppression and anti-aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
The TP53 tumor suppressor and autophagy in malignant lymphoma.The TP53 (p53) protein is a well-known tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability under various cellular stresses. Loss of TP53 causes lymphomagenesis in mouse models and/or promotes tumor progression. However  the prognostic significance of TP53 has been inconsistent in human cancers including malignant lymphoma. In our recent review of TP53 dysfunction in lymphoid malignancies  we discussed the fact that the TP53 function in autophagy may be one of the important mechanisms responsible for the inconsistency of TP53 prognostic value  in that autophagy can promote survival of lymphoma cells by recycling toxic intracellular materials and inhibiting apoptosis. Here we discuss the biological mechanisms of TP53 functional switches from apoptosis to autophagy  and provide a brief summary of how TP53 regulates autophagy through its transcriptional activity on 14 genes of the TP53 pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation where autophagy intersects the inflammasome.The autophagy and inflammasome pathways are ancient innate immune mechanisms for controlling invading pathogens that are linked by mutual regulation. In addition to controlling the metabolic homeostasis of the cell through nutrient recycling  the "self-eating" process of autophagy is also responsible for the degradation of damaged organelles  cells  and pathogens to protect the integrity of the organism. As a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) complex  the inflammasome both induces and is induced by autophagy through direct interactions with autophagy proteins or through the effects of secondary molecules  such as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA.,Autophagy_notLIR
The antifungal occidiofungin triggers an apoptotic mechanism of cell death in yeast.Occidiofungin is a nonribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide having a base mass of 1200 Da. It is naturally produced by the soil bacterium Burkholderia contaminans MS14 and possesses potent broad-spectrum antifungal properties. The mechanism of action of occidiofungin is unknown. Viability  terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)  reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection  membrane and cell wall stability  and membrane mimetic assays were used to characterize the effect of occidiofungin on yeast cells. Confocal and electron microscopy experiments were used to visualize morphological changes within treated cells. TUNEL and ROS detection assays revealed an increase in fluorescence with increasing concentrations of the antifungal. Yeast cells appeared to shrink in size and showed the presence of 'dancing bodies' at low drug concentrations (1 μg/mL). A screen carried out on Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion mutants in the apoptotic and autophagy pathways identified the apoptotic gene for YCA1  as having an important role in occidiofungin response as cells deleted for this gene exhibit a 2-fold increase in resistance. Results from our experiments demonstrate that the mechanism of action for occidiofungin in yeast is different from that of the common classes of antifungals used in the clinic  such as azoles  polyenes  and echinocandins. Our study also indicates that occidiofungin causes cell death in yeast through an apoptotic mechanism of action.,Autophagy_notLIR
Donkey orchid symptomless virus: a viral 'platypus' from Australian terrestrial orchids.Complete and partial genome sequences of two isolates of an unusual new plant virus  designated Donkey orchid symptomless virus (DOSV) were identified using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The virus was identified from asymptomatic plants of Australian terrestrial orchid Diuris longifolia (Common donkey orchid) growing in a remnant forest patch near Perth  western Australia. DOSV was identified from two D. longifolia plants of 264 tested  and from at least one plant of 129 Caladenia latifolia (pink fairy orchid) plants tested. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome revealed open reading frames (ORF) encoding seven putative proteins of apparently disparate origins. A 69-kDa protein (ORF1) that overlapped the replicase shared low identity with MPs of plant tymoviruses (Tymoviridae). A 157-kDa replicase (ORF2) and 22-kDa coat protein (ORF4) shared 32% and 40% amino acid identity  respectively  with homologous proteins encoded by members of the plant virus family Alphaflexiviridae. A 44-kDa protein (ORF3) shared low identity with myosin and an autophagy protein from Squirrelpox virus. A 27-kDa protein (ORF5) shared no identity with described proteins. A 14-kDa protein (ORF6) shared limited sequence identity (26%) over a limited region of the envelope glycoprotein precursor of mammal-infecting Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Bunyaviridae). The putative 25-kDa movement protein (MP) (ORF7) shared limited (27%) identity with 3A-like MPs of members of the plant-infecting Tombusviridae and Virgaviridae. Transmissibility was shown when DOSV systemically infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Structure and organization of the domains within the putative replicase of DOSV suggests a common evolutionary origin with 'potexvirus-like' replicases of viruses within the Alphaflexiviridae and Tymoviridae  and the CP appears to be ancestral to CPs of allexiviruses (Alphaflexiviridae). The MP shares an evolutionary history with MPs of dianthoviruses  but the other putative proteins are distant from plant viruses. DOSV is not readily classified in current lower order virus taxa.,Autophagy_notLIR
A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in selective mitochondria autophagy.Mitophagy is the process of selective mitochondrial degradation via autophagy  which has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. Very little is known  however  about the molecular mechanism of mitophagy. A genome-wide yeast mutant screen for mitophagy-defective strains identified 32 mutants with a block in mitophagy  in addition to the known autophagy-related (ATG) gene mutants. We further characterized one of these mutants  ylr356wDelta that corresponds to a gene whose function has not been identified. YLR356W is a mitophagy-specific gene that was not required for other types of selective autophagy or macroautophagy. The deletion of YLR356W partially inhibited mitophagy during starvation  whereas there was an almost complete inhibition at post-log phase. Accordingly  we have named this gene ATG33. The new mutants identified in this analysis will provide a useful foundation for researchers interested in the study of mitochondrial homeostasis and quality control.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting the lysosome in cancer.Lysosomes are membrane-bound intracellular organelles that receive macromolecules delivered by endocytosis  phagocytosis  and autophagy for degradation and recycling. Over the last decade  advances in lysosome research have established a broad role for the lysosome in the pathophysiology of disease. In this review  we highlight the recent discoveries in lysosome biology  with an emphasis on their implications for cancer therapy. We focus on targeting the lysosome in cancer by exploring lysosomal biogenesis and its role in the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy. We also discuss how lysosomal inhibition could emerge as a new therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Selective autophagy.During the last decade it has become evident that autophagy is not simply a non-selective bulk degradation pathway for intracellular components. On the contrary  the discovery and characterization of autophagy receptors which target specific cargo for lysosomal degradation by interaction with ATG8 (autophagy-related protein 8)/LC3 (light-chain 3) has accelerated our understanding of selective autophagy. A number of autophagy receptors have been identified which specifically mediate the selective autophagosomal degradation of a variety of cargoes including protein aggregates  signalling complexes  midbody rings  mitochondria and bacterial pathogens. In the present chapter  we discuss these autophagy receptors  their binding to ATG8/LC3 proteins and how they act in ubiquitin-mediated selective autophagy of intracellular bacteria (xenophagy) and protein aggregates (aggrephagy).,Autophagy_notLIR
Toll-like receptor-4-mediated autophagy contributes to microglial activation and inflammatory injury in mouse models of intracerebral haemorrhage.Much evidence demonstrates that Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-mediated microglial activation is an important contributor to the inflammatory injury in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). However  the exact mechanism of TLR4-mediated microglial activation induced by ICH is not clear. In addition  microglial autophagy is involved other forms of nervous system injury. To explore the relationship between TLR4 and autophagy  we investigated the role of TLR4-mediated microglial autophagy and inflammation in ICH.,Autophagy_notLIR
Preserving organelle vitality: peroxisomal quality control mechanisms in yeast.Cellular proteins and organelles such as peroxisomes are under continuous quality control. Upon synthesis in the cytosol  peroxisomal proteins are kept in an import-competent state by chaperones or specific proteins with an analogous function to prevent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. During protein translocation into the organelle  the peroxisomal targeting signal receptors (Pex5  Pex20) are also continuously undergoing quality control to enable efficient functioning of the translocon (RADAR pathway). Even upon maturation of peroxisomes  matrix enzymes and peroxisomal membranes remain subjected to quality control. As a result of their oxidative metabolism  peroxisomes are producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)  which may damage proteins and lipids. To counteract ROS-induced damage  yeast peroxisomes contain two important antioxidant enzymes: catalase and an organelle-specific peroxiredoxin. Additionally  a Lon-type protease has recently been identified in the peroxisomal matrix  which is capable of degrading nonfunctional proteins. Finally  cellular housekeeping processes keep track of the functioning of peroxisomes so that dysfunctional organelles can be quickly removed via selective autophagy (pexophagy). This review provides an overview of the major processes involved in quality control of yeast peroxisomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Withaferin A synergizes the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin through ROS-mediated autophagy in ovarian cancer.Application of doxorubicin (Dox) for the treatment of cancer is restricted due to its severe side effects. We used combination strategy by combining doxorubicin (Dox) with withaferin A (WFA) to minimize the ill effects of Dox. Treatment of various epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780  A2780/CP70 and CaOV3) with combination of WFA and Dox (WFA/DOX) showed a time- and dose-dependent synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death  thus reducing the dosage requirement of Dox. Combination treatment resulted in a significant enhancement of ROS production resulting in immense DNA damage  induction of autophagy analyzed by transmission electron microscope and increase in expression of autophagy marker LC3B  and culminated in cell death analyzed by cleaved caspase 3. We validated combination therapy on tumor growth using an in vitro 3Dimension (3D) tumor model and the more classic in vivo xenograft model of ovarian cancer. Both tumor models showed a 70 to 80% reduction in tumor growth compared to control or animals treated with WFA or Dox alone. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissues from animals treated with WFA/Dox combination showed a significant reduction in cell proliferation and formation of microvessels accompanied by increased in LC3B level  cleaved caspase 3  and DNA damage. Taken together  our data suggest that combining WFA with Dox decreases the dosage requirement of Dox  therefore  minimizing/eliminating the severe side effects associated with high doses of DOX  suggesting the application of this combination strategy for the treatment of ovarian and other cancers with no or minimum side effects.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cigarette smoke metabolically promotes cancer  via autophagy and premature aging in the host stromal microenvironment.Cigarette smoke has been directly implicated in the disease pathogenesis of a plethora of different human cancer subtypes  including breast cancers. The prevailing view is that cigarette smoke acts as a mutagen and DNA damaging agent in normal epithelial cells  driving tumor initiation. However  its potential negative metabolic effects on the normal stromal microenvironment have been largely ignored. Here  we propose a new mechanism by which carcinogen-rich cigarette smoke may promote cancer growth  by metabolically "fertilizing" the host microenvironment. More specifically  we show that cigarette smoke exposure is indeed sufficient to drive the onset of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype via the induction of DNA damage  autophagy and mitophagy in the tumor stroma. In turn  cigarette smoke exposure induces premature aging and mitochondrial dysfunction in stromal fibroblasts  leading to the secretion of high-energy mitochondrial fuels  such as L-lactate and ketone bodies. Hence  cigarette smoke induces catabolism in the local microenvironment  directly fueling oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in neighboring epithelial cancer cells  actively promoting anabolic tumor growth. Remarkably  these autophagic-senescent fibroblasts increased breast cancer tumor growth in vivo by up to 4-fold. Importantly  we show that cigarette smoke-induced metabolic reprogramming of the fibroblastic stroma occurs independently of tumor neo-angiogenesis. We discuss the possible implications of our current findings for the prevention of aging-associated human diseases and  especially  common epithelial cancers  as we show that cigarette smoke can systemically accelerate aging in the host microenvironment. Finally  our current findings are consistent with the idea that cigarette smoke induces the "reverse Warburg effect " thereby fueling "two-compartment tumor metabolism" and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
An initial step of GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles formation requires Rab7.Group A streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a common pathogen that invades non-phagocytic human cells via endocytosis. Once taken up by cells  it escapes from the endocytic pathway to the cytoplasm  but here it is contained within a membrane-bound structure termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). The autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 associates with GcAVs  and other components of the autophagosomal pathway are involved in GcAV formation. However  the mechanistic relationship between GcAV and canonical autophagy is largely unknown. Here  we morphologically analyzed GcAV formation in detail. Initially  a small  GFP-LC3-positive GcAV sequesters each streptococcal chain  and these then coalesce into a single  large GcAV. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab7 or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rab7 prevented the initial formation of small GcAV structures. Our results demonstrate that mechanisms of GcAV formation includes not only the common machinery of autophagy  but also Rab7 as an additional component  which is dispensable in canonical autophagosome formation.,Autophagy_notLIR

Dysregulation of autophagy in murine fibroblasts resistant to HSV-1 infection.The mouse L cell mutant  gro29  was selected for its ability to survive infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). gro29 cells are fully susceptible to HSV-1 infection  however  they produce 2000-fold less infectious virus than parental L cells despite their capacity to synthesize late viral gene products and assemble virions. Because productive HSV-1 infection is presumed to result in the death of the host cell  we questioned how gro29 cells might survive infection. Using time-lapse video microscopy  we demonstrated that a fraction of infected gro29 cells survived infection and divided. Electron microscopy of infected gro29 cells  revealed large membranous vesicles that contained virions as well as cytoplasmic constituents. These structures were reminiscent of autophagosomes. Autophagy is an ancient cellular process that  under nutrient deprivation conditions  results in the degradation and catabolism of cytoplasmic components and organelles. We hypothesized that enhanced autophagy  and resultant degradation of virions  might explain the ability of gro29 to survive HSV-1 infection. Here we demonstrate that gro29 cells have enhanced basal autophagy as compared to parental L cells. Moreover  treatment of gro29 cells with 3-methyladenine  an inhibitor of autophagy  failed to prevent the formation of autophagosome-like organelles in gro29 cells indicating that autophagy was dysregulated in these cells. Additionally  we observed robust co-localization of the virion structural component  VP26  with the autophagosomal marker  GFP-LC3  in infected gro29 cells that was not seen in infected parental L cells. Collectively  these data support a model whereby gro29 cells prevent the release of infectious virus by directing intracellular virions to an autophagosome-like compartment. Importantly  induction of autophagy in parental L cells did not prevent HSV-1 production  indicating that the relationship between autophagy  virus replication  and survival of HSV-1 infection by gro29 cells is complex.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Molecular mechanism of ophiopogonin B induced cellular autophagy of human cervical cancer HeLa cells].This study is to investigate the antitumor activity of ophiopogonin B (OP-B). MTT assay  flow cytometric analysis  acridine orange staining  Lyso-Tracker Red staining and HeLa-GFP-LC3 transfect cells assay were used to detect the proliferation activity  apoptosis and autophagy of HeLa cells. The results showed that OP-B exerted potent antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells  the cell growth inhibition effect of OP-B was not due to apoptosis and OP-B could induce autophagy of HeLa cells. OP-B also induced the protein expression up-regulation of Beclin-1 and promoted LC3 I transformation LC3 II  which were representative proteins of autophagy. Furthermore  3-MA  an inhibitor of autophagy  not only inhibited OP-B-mediated autophagy but also almost completely reversed the antiproliferative effect of OP-B  suggesting that the growth inhibition effect of OP-B was autophagy dependent. Western blotting demonstrated that OP-B inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and its' downstream vital protein  such as mTOR and p70S6K. In addition  OP-B also induced the protein expression up-regulation of PTEN  which is a negative regulation protein for Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. However  OP-B did not affect the protein expression of total Akt. Collectively  the antitumor effects of OP-B were autophagy-dependent via repression Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore  OP-B is a prospective inhibitor of Akt/mTOR and may be used as an alternative compound to treat cervical carcinoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Increased expression of ATG genes during nonfeeding periods in the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis.Ticks are long-lived hematophagous arthropods and have tolerance to starvation. They can survive without food during the host-seeking period for several months to years. To understand how ticks obtain energy over a long period of non-feeding (starvation)  we focused on autophagy  a crucial proteolysis system via the lysosomes for various cellular processes that is induced during starvation in eukaryotes. In the present study  EST databases for several organs of the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis led to the identification of HlATG3  HlATG4 and HlATG8  homologues of 3 autophagy-related (ATG) genes  ATG3  ATG4 and ATG8/LC3/GABARAP  respectively  which are essential for the Atg8 conjugation system in model animals. Real-time PCR results revealed that the expression of HlATG3  HlATG4 and HlATG8 in the tick showed higher levels during the non-feeding period than the feeding period  suggesting that the Atg8 conjugation system is at work in unfed ticks. Notably  their expression levels were higher in the midgut  a digestive organ  of unfed than fed adults. Histological analysis demonstrated that lipids and glycogen accumulated within the epithelial cells of the midgut in unfed ticks  implying that the midgut of unfed ticks serves as storage of those components as nutrients during non-feeding. Furthermore  autophagic organelles were found in the midgut undifferentiated cells of unfed ticks. The starved condition appears to be associated with the increased expression of HlATG genes in the midgut of unfed ticks. Tick autophagy might help compensate for the loss of nutrients derived from host blood components during the non-feeding period.,Autophagy_notLIR
Many mechanisms  one entrance: membrane protein translocation into the nucleus.The inner nuclear membrane harbors a unique set of membrane proteins  many of which interact with nuclear intermediate filaments and chromatin components and thus play an important role in nuclear organization and gene expression regulation. These membrane proteins have to be constantly transported into the nucleus from their sites of synthesis in the ER to match the growth of the nuclear membrane during interphase. Many mechanisms have evolved to enable translocation of these proteins to the nucleus. The full range of mechanisms goes from rare autophagy events to regulated translocation using the nuclear pore complexes. Though mechanisms involving nuclear pores are predominant  within this group an enormous mechanistic range is observed from free diffusion through the peripheral channels to many distinct mechanisms involving different nucleoporins and other components of the soluble protein transport machinery in the central channels. This review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into this mechanistic diversity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting autophagy as a potential therapeutic approach for melanoma therapy.Melanoma  occurring as a rapidly progressive skin cancer  is resistant to current chemo- and radiotherapy  especially after metastases to distant organs has taken place. Most chemotherapeutic drugs exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptosis  which  however  is often deficient in cancer cells. Thus  it is appropriate to attempt the targeting of alternative pathways  which regulate cellular viability. Recent studies of autophagy  a well-conserved cellular catabolic process  promise to improve the therapeutic outcome in melanoma patients. Although a dual role for autophagy in cancer therapy has been reported  both protecting against and promoting cell death  the potential for using autophagy in cancer therapy seems to be promising. Here  we review the recent literature on the role of autophagy in melanoma with respect to the expression of autophagic markers  the involvement of autophagy in chemo- and immunotherapy  as well as the role of autophagy in hypoxia and altered metabolic pathways employed for melanoma therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of membrane proteins in mammalian autophagy.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradative process that is initiated by autophagosomes  double-membrane structures that sequester cytoplasmic material and fuse with endosomes and lysosomes to become autolysosomes. Recent progress in the identification of proteins required for autophagy has led to a substantial understanding of the process involved in making an autophagosome. Mammalian Atg9  a multi-spanning transmembrane protein  is one of the possible keys to understanding how autophagosomes are formed. Current and future advances in understanding the function of mammalian Atg9 will provide a basis for further progress. In addition  the identification of so far uncharacterized transmembrane proteins which are involved in autophagy will also help to address the important questions of where  how  and why autophagosomes form.,Autophagy_notLIR

ORMDL orosomucoid-like proteins are degraded by free-cholesterol-loading-induced autophagy.Eukaryotic cells have evolved robust mechanisms to counter excess cholesterol including redistribution of lipids into different compartments and compensatory up-regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. We demonstrate here that excess cellular cholesterol increased the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT)  the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingomyelin synthesis. This increased SPT activity was not due to altered levels of SPTLC1 or SPTLC2  the major subunits of SPT. Instead  cholesterol loading decreased the levels of ORMDL1  a negative regulator of SPT activity  due to its increased turnover. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that free-cholesterol-induced autophagy  which led to increased turnover of ORMDL1. Cholesterol loading induced ORMDL1 redistribution from the ER to cytoplasmic p62 positive autophagosomes. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of cholesterol-loaded cells showed increased association between ORMDL1 and p62. The lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine or siRNA knockdown of Atg7 inhibited ORMDL1 degradation by cholesterol  whereas proteasome inhibitors showed no effect. ORMDL1 degradation was specific to free-cholesterol loading as autophagy induced by serum starvation or general ER stress did not lead to ORMDL1 degradation. ORMDL proteins are thus previously unidentified responders to excess cholesterol  exiting the ER to activate SPT and increase sphingomyelin biosynthesis  which may buffer excess cellular cholesterol.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chaperone-mediated autophagy: dedicated saviour and unfortunate victim in the neurodegeneration arena.The importance of cellular quality-control systems in the maintenance of neuronal homoeostasis and in the defence against neurodegeneration is well recognized. Chaperones and proteolytic systems  the main components of these cellular surveillance mechanisms  are key in the fight against the proteotoxicity that is often associated with severe neurodegenerative diseases. However  in recent years  a new theme has emerged which suggests that components of protein quality-control pathways are often targets of the toxic effects of pathogenic proteins and that their failure to function properly contributes to pathogenesis and disease progression. In the present mini-review  we describe this dual role as 'saviour' and 'victim' in the context of neurodegeneration for chaperone-mediated autophagy  a cellular pathway involved in the selective degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and UPR in alpha-crystallin mutant knock-in mouse models of hereditary cataracts.Knock-in mice provide useful models of congenital and age-related cataracts caused by α-crystallin mutations. R49C αA-crystallin and R120G αB-crystallin mutations are linked with hereditary cataracts. Knock-in αA-R49C+/- heterozygotes develop cataracts by 1-2months  whereas homozygote mice have cataracts at birth. The R49C mutation drastically reduces lens protein water solubility and causes cell death in knock-in mouse lenses. Mutant crystallin cannot function as a chaperone  which leads to protein aggregation and lens opacity. Protein aggregation disrupts the lens fiber cell structure and normal development and causes cell death in epithelial and fiber cells. We determined what aspects of the wild-type phenotype are age-dependently altered in the mutant lens.,Autophagy_notLIR
FOXO1 silence aggravates oxidative stress-promoted apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by reducing autophagy.Mechanisms underlining oxidative stress-induced injury to cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction (MI) or acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) are not well recognized. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have been defined as critical mediators of oxidative stress resistance in multiple cell types  but their cardioprotective functions have not been reported previously. In the present study  we investigated the promotion to FOXO1 by the treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during the H2O2-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells. We then silenced FOXO1 with FOXO1-specific siRNA  and re-evaluated the H2O2-induced apoptosis. In addition  we also examined the H2O2-induced autophagy and the autophagy induction post FOXO1 silence. Results demonstrated that H2O2 induced a significantly high level of apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Interestingly  the FOXO1 in both mRNA and protein levels were not significantly regulated  however  the phosphorylated form of FOXO1 was significantly promoted in the H2O2-treated H9c2 cells. On the other hand  post the significant knockout of FOXO1 with the transfection with FOXO1-specific siRNA  the apoptosis induction was more significant in H9c2 cells subjected to H2O2. In addition  we found a significantly higher level of autophagy induction in the H2O2-treated H9c2 cells. However  the autophagy was markedly reduced by the knockout of FOXO1. In summary  these data support the critical role for FOXO1 in promoting cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress probably through inducing autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Spread of neuronal degeneration in a dopaminergic  Lrrk-G2019S model of Parkinson disease.Flies expressing the most common Parkinson disease (PD)-related mutation  LRRK2-G2019S  in their dopaminergic neurons show loss of visual function and degeneration of the retina  including mitochondrial abnormalities  apoptosis and autophagy. Since the photoreceptors that degenerate are not dopaminergic  this demonstrates nonautonomous degeneration  and a spread of pathology. This provides a model consistent with Braak's hypothesis on progressive PD. The loss of visual function is specific for the G2019S mutation  implying the cause is its increased kinase activity  and is enhanced by increased neuronal activity. These data suggest novel explanations for the variability in animal models of PD. The specificity of visual loss to G2019S  coupled with the differences in neural firing rate  provide an explanation for the variability between people with PD in visual tests.,Autophagy_notLIR
Proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii suppresses host cell autophagy.Autophagy is a process of cytoplasmic degradation of endogenous proteins and organelles. Although its primary role is protective  it can also contribute to cell death. Recently  autophagy was found to play a role in the activation of host defense against intracellular pathogens. The aims of our study was to investigate whether host cell autophagy influences Toxoplasma gondii proliferation and whether autophagy inhibitors modulate cell survival. HeLa cells were infected with T. gondii with and without rapamycin treatment to induce autophagy. Lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that cell death was extensive at 36-48 hr after infection in cells treated with T. gondii with or without rapamycin. The autophagic markers  LC3 II and Beclin 1  were strongly expressed at 18-24 hr after exposure as shown by Western blotting and RT-PCR. However  the subsequent T. gondii proliferation suppressed autophagy at 36 hr post-infection. Pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor  3-methyladenine (3-MA)  down-regulated LC3 II and Beclin 1. The latter was also down-regulated by calpeptin  a calpain inhibitor. Monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) staining detected numerous autophagic vacuoles (AVs) at 18 hr post-infection. Ultrastructural observations showed T. gondii proliferation in parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) coinciding with a decline in the numbers of AVs by 18 hr. FACS analysis failed to confirm the presence of cell apoptosis after exposure to T. gondii and rapamycin. We concluded that T. gondii proliferation may inhibit host cell autophagy and has an impact on cell survival.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Inclusion body myositis].Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is an intractable and progressive skeletal muscle disease of unknown cause that has no curative treatment. Its prevalence varies among countries and ethnic groups. The clinical course is slow and chronic worsening. Diagnosis of sIBM is usually made 5 years after onset. Muscle weakness and atrophy in the quadriceps  wrist flexor  and finger flexors are the typical neurological findings of sIBM. Dysphagia and asymmetric weakness are often found as well. Serum creatine kinase is usually below 2 000 IU/L. Muscle biopsy typically reveals endomysial inflammation  invasion of mononuclear cells into non-necrotic fibers  and rimmed vacuoles  suggesting that inflammation and degeneration are coexist in the pathomechanism. The etiology of sIBM is still unknown; however  genetic factors  aging  lifestyle  and environmental factors may be involved. Recent studies have implicated amyloid beta accumulation  defects of proteolysis  and immune system abnormalities in the pathomechanism of sIBM. sIBM is generally refractory to current therapy  such as steroids or immunosuppressants. Recently  alemtuzumab  which targets T cells  has resulted in improvement in quantitative muscle strength testing. New strategies to induce proteolysis and autophagy  accelerate muscle regeneration  inhibit myostatin  and modulate inflammatory cells are promising. Elucidation of the pathomechanism of sIBM is the key to developing effective therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Novel features of Brassica napus embryogenic microspores revealed by high pressure freezing and freeze substitution: evidence for massive autophagy and excretion-based cytoplasmic cleaning.Induction of embryogenesis from isolated microspore cultures is a complex experimental system where microspores undergo dramatic changes in developmental fate. After ~40 years of application of electron microscopy to the study of the ultrastructural changes undergone by the induced microspore  there is still room for new discoveries. In this work  high pressure freezing and freeze substitution (HPF/FS)  the best procedures known to date for ultrastructural preservation  were used to process Brassica napus microspore cultures covering all the stages of microspore embryogenesis. Analysis of these cultures by electron microscopy revealed massive processes of autophagy exclusively in embryogenic microspores  but not in other microspore-derived structures also present in cultures. However  a significant part of the autophagosomal cargo was not recycled. Instead  it was transported out of the cell  producing numerous deposits of extracytoplasmic fibrillar and membranous material. It was shown that commitment of microspores to embryogenesis is associated with both massive autophagy and excretion of the removed material. It is hypothesized that autophagy would be related to the need for a profound cytoplasmic cleaning  and excretion would be a mechanism to avoid excessive growth of the vacuolar system. Together  the results also demonstrate that the application of HPF/FS to the study of the androgenic switch is the best option currently available to identify the complex and dramatic ultrastructural changes undergone by the induced microspore. In addition  they provide significant insights to understand the cellular basis of induction of microspore embryogenesis  and open a new door for the investigation of this intriguing developmental pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of 3-styrylchromones on metabolic profiles and cell death in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.4<i>H</i>-1-benzopyran-4-ones (chromones) are important naturally-distributing compounds. As compared with flavones  isoflavones and 2-styrylchromones  there are only few papers of 3-styrylchromones that have been published. We have previously reported that among fifteen 3-styrylchromone derivatives  three new synthetic compounds that have OCH<sub>3</sub> group at the C-6 position of chromone ring  (<i>E</i>)-3-(4-hydroxystyryl)-6-methoxy-4<i>H</i>-chromen-4-one (compound <b>11</b>)  (<i>E</i>)-6-methoxy-3-(4-methoxystyryl)-4<i>H</i>-chromen-4-one (compound <b>4</b>)  (<i>E</i>)-6-methoxy-3-(3 4 5-trimethoxystyryl)-4<i>H</i>-chromen-4-one (compound <b>6</b>) showed much higher cytotoxicities against four epithelial human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lines than human normal oral mesenchymal cells. In order to further confirm the tumor specificities of these compounds  we compared their cytotoxicities against both human epithelial malignant and non-malignant cells  and then investigated their effects on fine cell structures and metabolic profiles and cell death in human OSCC cell line HSC-2. Cytotoxicities of compounds <b>4</b>  <b>6</b>  <b>11</b> were assayed with MTT method. Fine cell structures were observed under transmission electron microscope. Cellular metabolites were extracted with methanol and subjected to CE-TOFMS analysis. Compounds <b>4</b>  <b>6</b>  <b>11</b> showed much weaker cytotoxicity against human oral keratinocyte and primary human gingival epithelial cells  as compared with HSC-2  confirming their tumor-specificity  whereas doxorubicin and 5-FU were highly cytotoxic to these normal epithelial cells  giving unexpectedly lower tumor-specificity. The most cytotoxic compound <b>11</b>  induced the mitochondrial vacuolization  autophagy suppression followed by apoptosis induction  and changes in the metabolites involved in amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolisms. Chemical modification of lead compound <b>11</b> may be a potential choice for designing new type of anticancer drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR
ULK1: a promising biomarker in predicting poor prognosis and therapeutic response in human nasopharygeal carcinoma.Plenty of studies have established that dysregulation of autophagy plays an essential role in cancer progression. The autophagy-related proteins have been reported to be closely associated with human cancer patients' prognosis. We explored the expression dynamics and prognostic value of autophagy-related protein ULK1 by immunochemistry (IHC) method in two independent cohorts of nasopharygeal carcinoma (NPC) cases. The X-tile program was applied to determine the optimal cut-off value in the training cohort. This derived cutoff value was then subjected to analysis the association of ULK1 expression with patients' clinical characteristics and survival outcome in the validation cohort and overall cases. High ULK1 expression was closely associated with aggressive clinical feature of NPC patients. Furthermore  high expression of ULK1 was observed more frequently in therapeutic resistant group than that in therapeutic effective group. Our univariate and multivariate analysis also showed that higher ULK1 expression predicted inferior disease-specific survival (DSS) (P<0.05). Consequently  a new clinicopathologic prognostic model with 3 poor prognostic factors (ie  ULK1 expression  overall clinical stage and therapeutic response) could significantly stratify risk (low  intermediate and high) for DSS in NPC patients (P<0.001). These findings provide evidence that  the examination of ULK1 expression by IHC method  could serve as an effective additional tool for predicting therapeutic response and patients' survival outcome in NPC patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lack of intestinal epithelial atg7 affects paneth cell granule formation but does not compromise immune homeostasis in the gut.Genetic polymorphisms of autophagy-related genes have been associated with an increased risk to develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Autophagy is an elementary process participating in several cellular events such as cellular clearance and nonapoptotic programmed cell death. Furthermore  autophagy may be involved in intestinal immune homeostasis due to its participation in the digestion of intracellular pathogens and in antigen presentation. In the present study  the role of autophagy in the intestinal epithelial layer was investigated. The intestinal epithelium is essential to maintain gut homeostasis  and defects within this barrier have been associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore  mice with intestinal epithelial deletion of Atg7 were generated and investigated in different mouse models. Knockout mice showed reduced size of granules and decreased levels of lysozyme in Paneth cells. However  this was dispensable for gut immune homeostasis and had no effect on susceptibility in mouse models of experimentally induced colitis.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role and modulation of autophagy in experimental models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.A physiological sequence called autophagy qualitatively determines cellular viability by removing protein aggregates and damaged cytoplasmic constituents  and contributes significantly to the degree of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This tightly orchestrated catabolic cellular 'housekeeping' process provides cells with a new source of energy to adapt to stressful conditions. This process was first described as a pro-survival mechanism  but increasing evidence suggests that it can also lead to the demise of the cell. Autophagy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cardiac conditions including myocardial I/R injury. However  a debate persists as to whether autophagy acts as a protective mechanism or contributes to the injurious effects of I/R injury in the heart. This controversy may stem from several factors including the variability in the experimental models and species  and the methodology used to assess autophagy. This review provides updated knowledge on the modulation and role of autophagy in isolated cardiac cells subjected to I/R  and the growing interest towards manipulating autophagy to increase the survival of cardiac myocytes under conditions of stress-most notably being I/R injury. Perturbation of this evolutionarily conserved intracellular cleansing autophagy mechanism  by targeted modulation through  among others  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulators  calcium lowering agents  resveratrol  longevinex  sirtuin activators  the proapoptotic gene Bnip3  IP3 and lysosome inhibitors  may confer resistance to heart cells against I/R induced cell death. Thus  therapeutic manipulation of autophagy in the challenged myocardium may benefit post-infarction cardiac healing and remodeling.,Autophagy_notLIR

The R740S mutation in the V-ATPase a3 subunit results in osteoclast apoptosis and defective early-stage autophagy.Vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) are located in lysosomes and at the ruffled border in osteoclasts. We showed previously that the R740S mutation is dominant negative for V-ATPase activity  uncouples proton transport from ATP hydrolysis and causes osteopetrosis in heterozygous mice (+/R740S). Here we show mice homozygous for R740S (R740S/R740S) have more severe osteopetrosis and die by postnatal day 14. Although R740S/R740S osteoclasts express wild-type levels of a3  it is mislocalized. Acridine orange staining of R740S/R740S osteoclasts grown on a Corning resorptive surface reveals no resorption and no acidification of intracellular compartments. Whereas osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis is normal  R740S/R740S osteoclasts exhibit increased apoptosis compared with wild-type osteoclasts. Localization of the enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is also aberrant. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that R740S/R740S osteoclasts do not polarize  lack ruffled borders  and contain fewer autophagosomes. Consistent with an early stage defect in autophagy  expression of LC3II is reduced and expression of p62 is increased in R740S/R740S compared to wild-type osteoclasts. These results indicate the importance of intracellular acidification for the early stages of autophagy as well as for osteoclast survival  maturation  and polarization with appropriate cytoplasmic distribution of key osteoclast enzymes such as TRAP.,Autophagy_notLIR
Short mitochondrial ARF triggers Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy.Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Multiple genes have been associated with PD  including Parkin and PINK1. Recent studies have established that the Parkin and PINK1 proteins function in a common mitochondrial quality control pathway  whereby disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to PINK1 stabilization at the mitochondrial outer surface. PINK1 accumulation leads to Parkin recruitment from the cytosol  which in turn promotes the degradation of the damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). Most studies characterizing PINK1/Parkin mitophagy have relied on high concentrations of chemical uncouplers to trigger mitochondrial depolarization  a stimulus that has been difficult to adapt to neuronal systems and one unlikely to faithfully model the mitochondrial damage that occurs in PD. Here  we report that the short mitochondrial isoform of ARF (smARF)  previously identified as an alternate translation product of the tumor suppressor p19ARF  depolarizes mitochondria and promotes mitophagy in a Parkin/PINK1-dependent manner  both in cell lines and in neurons. The work positions smARF upstream of PINK1 and Parkin and demonstrates that mitophagy can be triggered by intrinsic signaling cascades.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apoptosis and autophagy: regulatory connections between two supposedly different processes.Apoptosis and autophagy are genetically-regulated  evolutionarily-conserved processes that regulate cell fate. Both apoptosis and autophagy are important in development and normal physiology and in a wide range of diseases. Recent studies show that despite the marked differences between these two processes  their regulation is intimately connected and the same regulators can sometimes control both apoptosis and autophagy. In this review  I discuss some of these findings  which provide possible molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest that it may be useful to think of these processes as different facets of the same cell death continuum rather than completely separate processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Recent advances in the biology of heavy-ion cancer therapy.Superb biological effectiveness and dose conformity represent a rationale for heavy-ion therapy  which has thus far achieved good cancer controllability while sparing critical normal organs. Immediately after irradiation  heavy ions produce dense ionization along their trajectories  cause irreparable clustered DNA damage  and alter cellular ultrastructure. These ions  as a consequence  inactivate cells more effectively with less cell-cycle and oxygen dependence than conventional photons. The modes of heavy ion-induced cell death/inactivation include apoptosis  necrosis  autophagy  premature senescence  accelerated differentiation  delayed reproductive death of progeny cells  and bystander cell death. This paper briefly reviews the current knowledge of the biological aspects of heavy-ion therapy  with emphasis on the authors' recent findings. The topics include (i) repair mechanisms of heavy ion-induced DNA damage  (ii) superior effects of heavy ions on radioresistant tumor cells (intratumor quiescent cell population  TP53-mutated and BCL2-overexpressing tumors)  (iii) novel capacity of heavy ions in suppressing cancer metastasis and neoangiogenesis  and (iv) potential of heavy ions to induce secondary (especially breast) cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Role of Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase in Cerebral Ischemia.As recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the only drug approved for the clinical treatment of acute ischemic stroke  there is an urgent unmet need for novel stroke treatments. Endogenous defense mechanisms against stroke may hold the key to new therapies for stroke. A large number of studies suggest that nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (NAMPT is an attractive candidate to improve post-stroke recovery. NAMPT is a multifunctional protein and plays important roles in immunity  metabolism  aging  inflammation  and stress responses. NAMPT exists in both the intracellular and extracellular space. As a rate-limiting enzyme  the intracellular form (iNAMPT catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD from nicotinamide. iNAMPT closely regulates energy metabolism  enhancing the proliferation of endothelial cells  inhibiting apoptosis  regulating vascular tone  and stimulating autophagy in disease conditions such as stroke. Extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT is also known as visfatin (visceral fat-derived adipokine and has pleotropic effects. It is widely believed that the diverse biological functions of eNAMPT are attributed to its NAMPT enzymatic activity. However  the effects of eNAMPT on ischemic injury are still controversial. Some authors have argued that eNAMPT exacerbates ischemic neuronal injury non-enzymatically by triggering the release of TNF-α from glial cells. In addition  NAMPT also participates in several pathophysiological processes such as hypertension  atherosclerosis  and ischemic heart disease. Thus  it remains unclear under what conditions NAMPT is beneficial or destructive. Recent work using in vitro and in vivo genetic/ pharmacologic manipulations  including our own studies  has greatly improved our understanding of NAMPT. This review focuses on the multifaceted and complex roles of NAMPT under both normal and ischemic conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and mechanisms of effective immunity.Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a cellular pathway facilitating several critical functions. First  autophagy is a major pathway of degradation. It enables elimination of microbes that have invaded intracellular compartments. In addition  it promotes degradation of damaged cellular content  thereby acting to limit inflammatory signals. Second  autophagy is a major trafficking pathway  shuttling content between the cytosol and the lysosomal compartment. Given these two key roles  autophagy can have significant and sometimes unexpected consequences on mechanisms that initiate robust immunity. Here  we will discuss the impact of autophagy on pathways of innate and adaptive immune responses including microbe elimination  inflammatory cytokine production  antigen processing and T and B lymphocyte immunity.,Autophagy_notLIR
AKT3 controls mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy via regulation of the major nuclear export protein CRM-1.Our previous work has shown that Akt3 is required for mitochondrial biogenesis in primary human endothelial cells (ECs) and in Akt3-null mice; Akt3 affects subcellular localization of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1α)  the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism by which Akt3 controls the subcellular distribution of PGC-1α and to explore the effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover during angiogenesis. Here we use standard biochemical analyses and Akt3-knockdown strategies to show that Akt3 controls the stabilization of chromosome maintenance region-1 (CRM-1)  the major nuclear export receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis and association analyses show that PGC-1α nuclear export is CRM-1 dependent. Akt3 knockdown and CRM-1 overexpression cause 3-fold reductions in PGC-1α target gene expression  compared to control levels. Akt3 inhibition causes autophagy  as measured by autophagosome formation  in a CRM-1-dependent  Akt1/mTOR-independent pathway. In vivo  Akt3-null and heterozygous mice show dose-dependent decreases in angiogenesis compared to wild-type littermates (~5- and 2.5-fold decreases  respectively)  as assessed by Matrigel plug assays. This correlates with an ~1.5-fold decrease in mitochondrial Cox IV expression. Our studies suggest that Akt3 is a regulator of mitochondrial dynamics in the vasculature via regulation of CRM-1-dependent nuclear export.,Autophagy_notLIR

LAMP2A overexpression in breast tumors promotes cancer cell survival via chaperone-mediated autophagy.Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A) is a key protein in the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. LAMP2A helps in lysosomal uptake of modified and oxidatively damaged proteins directly into the lumen of lysosomes for degradation and protein turnover. Elevated expression of LAMP2A was observed in breast tumor tissues of all patients under investigation  suggesting a survival mechanism via CMA and LAMP2A. Reduced expression of the CMA substrates  GAPDH and PKM  was observed in most of the breast tumor tissues when compared with the normal adjacent tissues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated oxidative stress damages regulatory cellular components such as DNA  proteins and/or lipids. Protein carbonyl content (PCC) is widely used as a measure of total protein oxidation in cells. Ectopic expression of LAMP2A reduces PCC and thereby promotes cell survival during oxidative stress. Furthermore  inhibition of LAMP2A stimulates accumulation of GAPDH  AKT1 phosphorylation  generation of ROS  and induction of cellular apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin  which is a chemotherapeutic drug  often becomes ineffective against tumor cells with time due to chemotherapeutic resistance. Breast cancer cells deficient of LAMP2A demonstrate increased sensitivity to the drug. Thus  inhibiting CMA activity in breast tumor cells can be exploited as a potential therapeutic application in the treatment of breast cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quantitation of (a)symmetric inheritance of functional and of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial aconitase in the cell division of old yeast mother cells.Asymmetric segregation of oxidatively damaged proteins is discussed in the literature as a mechanism in cell division cycles which at the same time causes rejuvenation of the daughter cell and aging of the mother cell. This process must be viewed as cooperating with the cellular degradation processes like autophagy  proteasomal degradation and others. Together  these two mechanisms guarantee survival of the species and prevent clonal senescence of unicellular organisms  like yeast. It is widely believed that oxidative damage to proteins is primarily caused by oxygen radicals and their follow-up products produced in the mitochondria. As we have shown previously  old yeast mother cells in contrast to young cells contain reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. Here we show that aconitase of the mitochondrial matrix is readily inactivated by oxidative stress  but even in its inactive form is relatively long-lived and retains fluorescence in the Aco1p-eGFP form. The fluorescent protein is distributed between old mothers and their daughters approximately corresponding to the different sizes of mother and daughter cells. However  the remaining active enzyme is primarily inherited by the daughter cells. This indicates that asymmetric distribution of the still active enzyme takes place and a mechanism for discrimination between active and inactive enzyme must exist. As the aconitase remains mitochondrial during aging and cell division  our findings could indicate discrimination between active and no longer active mitochondria during the process.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effect of dual inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy in prostate cancer.Targeting multiple anti-apoptotic proteins is now possible with the small molecule BH3 domain mimetics such as ABT-737.

Regulation of skeletal muscle protein degradation and synthesis by oral administration of lysine in rats.Several catabolic diseases and unloading induce muscle mass wasting  which causes severe pathological progression in various diseases and aging. Leucine is known to attenuate muscle loss via stimulation of protein synthesis and suppression of protein degradation in skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lysine intake on protein degradation and synthesis in skeletal muscle. Fasted rats were administered 22.8-570 mg Lys/100 g body weight and the rates of myofibrillar protein degradation were assessed for 0-6 h after Lys administration. The rates of myofibrillar protein degradation evaluated by MeHis release from the isolated muscles were markedly suppressed after administration of 114 mg Lys/100 g body weight and of 570 mg Lys/100 g body weight. LC3-II  a marker of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway  tended to decrease (p=0.05  0.08) after Lys intake (114 mg/100 g body weight). However  expression of ubiquitin ligase E3 atrogin-1 mRNA and levels of ubiquitinated proteins were not suppressed by Lys intake. Phosphorylation levels of mTOR  S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the gastrocnemius muscle were not altered after Lys intake. These results suggest that Lys is able to suppress myofibrillar protein degradation at least partially through the autophagic-lysosomal pathway  not the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway  whereas Lys might be unable to stimulate protein synthesis within this time frame.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-dependent anticancer immune responses induced by chemotherapeutic agents in mice.Antineoplastic chemotherapies are particularly efficient when they elicit immunogenic cell death  thus provoking an anticancer immune response. Here we demonstrate that autophagy  which is often disabled in cancer  is dispensable for chemotherapy-induced cell death but required for its immunogenicity. In response to chemotherapy  autophagy-competent  but not autophagy-deficient  cancers attracted dendritic cells and T lymphocytes into the tumor bed. Suppression of autophagy inhibited the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from dying tumor cells. Conversely  inhibition of extracellular ATP-degrading enzymes increased pericellular ATP in autophagy-deficient tumors  reestablished the recruitment of immune cells  and restored chemotherapeutic responses but only in immunocompetent hosts. Thus  autophagy is essential for the immunogenic release of ATP from dying cells  and increased extracellular ATP concentrations improve the efficacy of antineoplastic chemotherapies when autophagy is disabled.,Autophagy_notLIR
LC3B-II deacetylation by histone deacetylase 6 is involved in serum-starvation-induced autophagic degradation.Autophagy is a conserved mechanism for controlling the degradation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in eukaryotes and can be induced by nutrient withdrawal  including serum starvation. Although differential acetylation of autophagy-related proteins has been reported to be involved in autophagic flux  the regulation of acetylated microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is incompletely understood. In this study  we found that the acetylation levels of phosphotidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated LC3B (LC3B-II)  which is a critical component of double-membrane autophagosome  were profoundly decreased in HeLa cells upon autophagy induction by serum starvation. Pretreatment with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine did not attenuate such deacetylation. Under normal culture medium  we observed increased levels of acetylated LC3B-II in cells treated with tubacin  a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). However  tubacin only partially suppressed serum-starvation-induced LC3B-II deacetylation  suggesting that HDAC6 is not the only deacetylase acting on LC3B-II during serum-starvation-induced autophagy. Interestingly  tubacin-induced increase in LC3B-II acetylation was associated with p62/SQSTM1 accumulation upon serum starvation. HDAC6 knockdown did not influence autophagosome formation but resulted in impaired degradation of p62/SQSTM1 during serum starvation. Collectively  our data indicated that LC3B-II deacetylation  which was partly mediated by HDAC6  is involved in autophagic degradation during serum starvation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of autophagy in immunity and autoimmunity  with a special focus on systemic lupus erythematosus.Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process that allows cells to degrade unwanted cytoplasmic constituents and to recycle nutrients. Autophagy is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses  playing a key role in interactions against microbes  in antigen processing for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation  and in lymphocyte development  survival  and proliferation. Over recent years  perturbations in autophagy have been implicated in a number of diseases  including autoimmunity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial disease characterized by autoimmune responses against self-antigens generated by dying cells. Genome-wide association studies have linked several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the autophagy-related gene Atg5 to SLE susceptibility. Loss of Atg5-dependent effects  including clearance of dying cells and cell antigen presentation  might contribute to the autoimmunity and inflammation associated with SLE. Moreover  activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  a key player in the autophagy regulation  has recently been demonstrated in SLE  confirming an altered autophagy pathway in this disease. In the present review  we summarize the autophagy mechanisms  their molecular regulation  and their relevance in immunity and autoimmunity. The potential of targeting autophagy pathway in SLE  by developing innovative therapeutic approaches  has finally been discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
UNC-51/ATG1 kinase regulates axonal transport by mediating motor-cargo assembly.Axonal transport mediated by microtubule-dependent motors is vital for neuronal function and viability. Selective sets of cargoes  including macromolecules and organelles  are transported long range along axons to specific destinations. Despite intensive studies focusing on the motor machinery  the regulatory mechanisms that control motor-cargo assembly are not well understood. Here we show that UNC-51/ATG1 kinase regulates the interaction between synaptic vesicles and motor complexes during transport in Drosophila. UNC-51 binds UNC-76  a kinesin heavy chain (KHC) adaptor protein. Loss of unc-51 or unc-76 leads to severe axonal transport defects in which synaptic vesicles are segregated from the motor complexes and accumulate along axons. Genetic studies show that unc-51 and unc-76 functionally interact in vivo to regulate axonal transport. UNC-51 phosphorylates UNC-76 on Ser(143)  and the phosphorylated UNC-76 binds Synaptotagmin-1  a synaptic vesicle protein  suggesting that motor-cargo interactions are regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In addition  defective axonal transport in unc-76 mutants is rescued by a phospho-mimetic UNC-76  but not a phospho-defective UNC-76  demonstrating the essential role of UNC-76 Ser(143) phosphorylation in axonal transport. Thus  our data provide insight into axonal transport regulation that depends on the phosphorylation of adaptor proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Synthesis of novel oxime-containing pyrazole derivatives and discovery of regulators for apoptosis and autophagy in A549 lung cancer cells.A series of novel oxime-containing pyrazole derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of ethyl 3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate derivatives and 2-bromo-1-phenylethanone followed by the reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The structures were determined by IR  (1)H NMR  HRMS  and X-ray analysis. A dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation was observed in A549 lung cancer cell after compound treatment. Inhibition of growth was mainly attributed to the autophagy induction.,Autophagy_notLIR
The homozygote VCP(R¹⁵⁵H/R¹⁵⁵H) mouse model exhibits accelerated human VCP-associated disease pathology.Valosin containing protein (VCP) mutations are the cause of hereditary inclusion body myopathy  Paget's disease of bone  frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). VCP gene mutations have also been linked to 2% of isolated familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). VCP is at the intersection of disrupted ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy pathways  mechanisms responsible for the intracellular protein degradation and abnormal pathology seen in muscle  brain and spinal cord. We have developed the homozygous knock-in VCP mouse (VCP(R155H/R155H)) model carrying the common R155H mutations  which develops many clinical features typical of the VCP-associated human diseases. Homozygote VCP(R155H/R155H) mice typically survive less than 21 days  exhibit weakness and myopathic changes on EMG. MicroCT imaging of the bones reveal non-symmetrical radiolucencies of the proximal tibiae and bone  highly suggestive of PDB. The VCP(R155H/R155H) mice manifest prominent muscle  heart  brain and spinal cord pathology  including striking mitochondrial abnormalities  in addition to disrupted autophagy and ubiquitin pathologies. The VCP(R155H/R155H) homozygous mouse thus represents an accelerated model of VCP disease and can be utilized to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inflammatory bowel disease: review from the aspect of genetics.Regardless of how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is defined  the term "genetic susceptibility" is always included. Due to substantial progress in the characterization of susceptible genes that interact with environmental influences  a number of review articles offering the latest insights continue to be presented. To date  more than 30 novel IBD susceptible loci have been found  while several promising associations between IBD and gene variants have also been identified and replicated effectively. The present review highlights recent insights regarding linkage analysis and genome-wide association presented in studies of IBD susceptible genes  which provide additional evidence supporting their involvement in disease pathogenesis  based on linking to innate immune systems as a result of interactions with intestinal microbial flora. An improved understanding of IBD genetics will promote the identification of novel therapeutic agents  making it possible to identify environmental factors related to intestinal inflammation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oxidative stress and altered mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases: lessons from mouse models.Oxidative stress has been consistently linked to ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases leading to the generation of lipid peroxides  carbonyl proteins and oxidative DNA damage in tissue samples from affected brains. Studies from mouse models that express disease-specific mutant proteins associated to the major neurodegenerative processes have underscored a critical role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of these diseases. There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in neurodegeneration. Mitochondria are the main cellular source of reactive oxygen species and key regulators of cell death. Moreover  mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that divide  fuse and move along axons and dendrites to supply cellular energetic demands; therefore  impairment of any of these processes would directly impact on neuronal viability. Most of the disease-specific pathogenic mutant proteins have been shown to target mitochondria  promoting oxidative stress and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In addition  disease-specific mutant proteins may also impair mitochondrial dynamics and recycling of damaged mitochondria via autophagy. Collectively  these data suggest that ROS-mediated defective mitochondria may accumulate during and contribute to disease progression. Strategies aimed to improve mitochondrial function or ROS scavenging may thus be of potential clinical relevance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Intermittent Hypoxia Affects the Spontaneous Differentiation In Vitro of Human Neutrophils into Long-Lived Giant Phagocytes.Previously we identified  for the first time  a new small-size subset of neutrophil-derived giant phagocytes (Gϕ) which spontaneously develop in vitro without additional growth factors or cytokines. Gϕ are CD66b(+)/CD63(+)/MPO(+)/LC3B(+) and are characterized by extended lifespan  large phagolysosomes  active phagocytosis  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production  and autophagy largely controls their formation. Hypoxia  and particularly hypoxia/reoxygenation  is a prominent feature of many pathological processes. Herein we investigated Gϕ formation by applying various hypoxic conditions. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) (29 cycles/day for 5 days) completely abolished Gϕ formation  while acute IH had dose-dependent effects. Exposure to 24 h (56 IH cycles) decreased their size  yield  phagocytic ability  autophagy  mitophagy  and gp91-phox/p22-phox expression  whereas under 24 h sustained hypoxia (SH) the size and expression of LC3B and gp91-phox/p22-phox resembled Gϕ formed in normoxia. Diphenyl iodide (DPI)  a NADPH oxidase inhibitor  as well as the PI3K/Akt and autophagy inhibitor LY294002 abolished Gϕ formation at all oxygen conditions. However  the potent antioxidant  N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abrogated the effects of IH by inducing large CD66b(+)/LC3B(+) Gϕ and increased both NADPH oxidase expression and phagocytosis. These findings suggest that NADPH oxidase  autophagy  and the PI3K/Akt pathway are involved in Gϕ development.,Autophagy_notLIR
Combined treatment with quercetin and imperatorin as a potent strategy for killing HeLa and Hep-2 cells.The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of quercetin and imperatorin administered separately and in combination on apoptosis and autophagy induction in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells cultured in vitro. Conducted MTT measurements proved that quercetin and imperatorin displayed a strong antiproliferative activity manifested in markedly reduction of HeLa and Hep-2 cells viability as a result of treatment with 50 μM of each compound. Further cell staining assays revealed that concentration mentioned above generated the highest percentage of apoptotic cells especially in the case of application of both drugs for 48 h. Simultaneous quercetin and imperatorin administration induced apoptosis remarkably stronger than treatment with single drugs. Experiments at the molecular level confirmed these results accompanied with the decreased Hsp27 and Hsp72 expression and  in addition  with increased caspases activity. Autophagy was not observed and no significant changes in the expression of beclin-1 were noticed. Additionally  experiments were performed on the above-mentioned cell lines with blocked Hsp27 and Hsp72 expression. In these cells  no significant changes in the sensitivity to apoptosis induction upon quercetin and imperatorin treatment were observed. The present study has provided evidence supporting the potential of the combination of quercetin and imperatorin drugs as a novel tool to be used in anticancer therapy. Our results have also demonstrated that blocking of the Hsp27 and Hsp72 gene expression is not enough to sensitize cancer cells to programmed cell death induction in HeLa and Hep-2 cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chediak-Higashi syndrome: studies in long-term bone marrow culture.The granulocyte defects of Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) include neutropenia  characteristic giant lysosomal granule morphology  and functionally abnormal cell motility  degranulation  and bacterial killing. Findings of elevated levels of adenosine 3'  5' cyclic monophosphate nucleotide (cAMP) and of concanavalin A (Con A) capping have suggested a pathogenic role of a cyclic-nucleotide-related defect in microtubule polymerization  but not all patients exhibit these abnormalities. In order to test which defects derive from the cells' genetic program and which from the host environment  we examined granulocytes produced by CHS bone marrow progenitors in long-term in vitro bone marrow cultures. These cells exhibited the characteristic giant-granule morphology and defective cell motility of CHS. However  culture-derived CHS granulocytes had normal cAMP contents and normal spontaneous capping of Con A. Granulopoiesis diminished dramatically after five weeks in culture  with accompanying autophagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes. In mixing experiments  the phenotype of the mature granulocytes corresponded to the genotype of the hematopoietic component of the culture rather than the stroma. These results indicate that the hallmark giant-granule morphology and cell motility defect of CHS are expressions of the genetic program of the hematopoietic cells. However the abnormalities in resting cyclic nucleotide levels and in Con-A capping may be secondary manifestations of the disease and are not essential to the pathogenesis of the chemotactic defect.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular characterization of propolis-induced cell death in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Propolis  a natural product of plant resins  is used by the bees to seal holes in their honeycombs and protect the hive entrance. However  propolis has also been used in folk medicine for centuries. Here  we apply the power of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism for studies of genetics  cell biology  and genomics to determine how propolis affects fungi at the cellular level. Propolis is able to induce an apoptosis cell death response. However  increased exposure to propolis provides a corresponding increase in the necrosis response. We showed that cytochrome c but not endonuclease G (Nuc1p) is involved in propolis-mediated cell death in S. cerevisiae. We also observed that the metacaspase YCA1 gene is important for propolis-mediated cell death. To elucidate the gene functions that may be required for propolis sensitivity in eukaryotes  the full collection of about 4 800 haploid S. cerevisiae deletion strains was screened for propolis sensitivity. We were able to identify 138 deletion strains that have different degrees of propolis sensitivity compared to the corresponding wild-type strains. Systems biology revealed enrichment for genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain  vacuolar acidification  negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter  regulation of macroautophagy associated with protein targeting to vacuoles  and cellular response to starvation. Validation studies indicated that propolis sensitivity is dependent on the mitochondrial function and that vacuolar acidification and autophagy are important for yeast cell death caused by propolis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hyperosmotic stress induces autophagy and apoptosis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell culture.During recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cell culture  various events  such as feeding with concentrated nutrient solutions or the addition of base to maintain an optimal pH  increase the osmolality of the medium. To determine the effect of hyperosmotic stress on two types of programmed cell death (PCD)  apoptosis and autophagy  of rCHO cells  two rCHO cell lines  producing antibody and erythropoietin  were subjected to hyperosmotic stress resulting from NaCl addition (310-610 mOsm/kg). For both rCHO cell lines  hyperosmolality up to 610 mOsm/kg increased cleaved forms of PARP  caspase-3  caspase-7  and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA  confirming the previous observation that apoptosis was induced by hyperosmotic stress. Concurrently  hyperosmolality increased the level of accumulation of LC3-II  a widely used autophagic marker  which was determined by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. When glucose and glutamine concentrations were measured during the cultures  glucose and glutamine concentrations in the culture medium at various osmolalities (310-610 mOsm/kg) showed no significant differences. This result suggests that induction of PCD by hyperosmotic stress occurred independently of nutrient depletion. Taken together  autophagy as well as apoptosis was observed in rCHO cells subjected to hyperosmolality.,Autophagy_notLIR

The first molecular evidence that autophagy relates rimmed vacuole formation in chloroquine myopathy.Chloroquine myopathy is a drug poisoning disease involving rimmed vacuole formation. By Western blot analysis  we investigated posttranslational modification of LC3 in cultured cells with a high concentration of chloroquine  and found that the autophagosome membrane-bound form of LC3 increased dose-dependently. We also constructed a disease model by excessive chloroquine injection into rats and unusual immunohistochemical alteration was chased using anti-LC3 antibodies. With chloroquine treatment  muscle atrophy occurred predominantly in soleus muscle and unusual autophagosomes were accumulated. Therefore  we concluded that autophagy plays an important role in rimmed vacuole formation in certain muscular atrophies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Understanding the Warburg effect and the prognostic value of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of a lethal tumor microenvironment.Cancer cells show a broad spectrum of bioenergetic states  with some cells using aerobic glycolysis while others rely on oxidative phosphorylation as their main source of energy. In addition  there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors  between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment  and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma  due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction  is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression. More specifically   increased autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stroma drives a form of parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy  as both would disrupt this energetic coupling. We also discuss evidence that glutamine addiction in cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production in cancer cells  in turn  could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle  the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus  we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy  for example  in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies. In direct support of this notion  we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of oxidative stress  hypoxia  and autophagy in the tumor microenvironment  explaining its powerful predictive value. Loss of stromal caveolin-1 in breast cancers is associated with early tumor recurrence  metastasis  and drug resistance  leading to poor clinical outcome.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lithium and autophagy.Lithium  a drug used to treat bipolar disorders  has a variety of neuroprotective mechanisms  including autophagy regulation  in various neuropsychiatric conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases  lithium enhances degradation of aggregate-prone proteins  including mutated huntingtin  phosphorylated tau  and α-synuclein  and causes damaged mitochondria to degrade  while in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease autophagy downregulation by lithium is observed. The signaling pathway of lithium as an autophagy enhancer might be associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-independent pathway  which is involved in myo-inositol-1 4 5-trisphosphate (IP3) in Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. However  the mTOR-dependent pathway might be involved in inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) in other diseases. Lithium's autophagy-enhancing property may contribute to the therapeutic benefit of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Critical role of autophage in ischemia/reperfusion injury to aged livers.A steady increase in life expectancy has resulted in an equivalent increase in elderly patients who are more susceptible to diseases than young patients. In a recent study  we found that in both in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)  a loss of ATG4B is causatively associated with the increased sensitivity of the liver to I/R injury with age. Our work suggests that a restoration or enhancement of autophagy is a novel therapeutic modality to ameliorate liver function after I/R to aged livers.,Autophagy_notLIR
miR-17-5p downregulation contributes to paclitaxel resistance of lung cancer cells through altering beclin1 expression.Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Paclitaxel based combination therapies have long been used as a standard treatment in aggressive NSCLCs. But paclitaxel resistance has emerged as a major clinical problem in combating non-small-cell lung cancer and autophagy is one of the important mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. In this study  we used microRNA (miRNA) arrays to screen differentially expressed miRNAs between paclitaxel sensitive lung cancer cells A549 and its paclitaxel-resistant cell variant (A549-T24). We identified miR-17-5p was one of most significantly downregulated miRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells compared to paclitaxel sensitive parental cells. We found that overexpression of miR-17-5p sensitized paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cells to paclitaxel induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover  in this report we demonstrated that miR-17-5p directly binds to the 3'-UTR of beclin 1 gene  one of the most important autophagy modulator. Overexpression of miR-17-5p into paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cells reduced beclin1 expression and a concordant decease in cellular autophagy. We also observed similar results in another paclitaxel resistant lung adenosquamous carcinoma cells (H596-TxR). Our results indicated that paclitaxel resistance of lung cancer is associated with downregulation of miR-17-5p expression which might cause upregulation of BECN1 expression.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effective prevention and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection using a combination of catechins and sialic acid in AGS cells and BALB/c mice.The increasing emergence of Helicobacter pylori strains resistant to antibiotics may cause unsuccessful treatment. An alternative agent or mixture with anti-H. pylori effect is urgently required to reduce H. pylori infection. We explored the preventive and therapeutic potential of a combination of catechins and sialic acid on H. pylori-infected human gastric cells in vitro and in mice in vivo. We evaluated the anti-H. pylori activity of catechins and/or sialic acid using the agar dilution and checkerboard methods. The effect of catechins and/or sialic acid on H. pylori infection-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis/autophagy in cell culture was explored using an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence analyzer  immunocytochemistry  and Western blotting. Specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice were divided into uninfected control  infected control  pretreated  and post-treated groups. The effects of catechins/sialic acid were determined by histology and immunocytochemistry. The combination of catechins and sialic acid showed synergistic or additive anti-H. pylori activity and significantly reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and Bax/Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis but enhanced Beclin-1-mediated autophagy. All mice infected with H. pylori displayed gastritis and accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal. Pretreatment with catechins/sialic acid completely prevented H. pylori infection and resulted in normal histology. Post-treatment with catechins/sialic acid decreased the bacterial load and gastritis score and eradicated up to 60% of H. pylori infections in a dose-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge of a nonprobiotic  nonantibiotic treatment that is 100% effective in preventing and has promising possibilities for treating H. pylori infection. Further studies are needed to confirm this result in humans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cloning  expression analysis  and RNA interference study of a HORMA domain containing autophagy-related gene 13 (ATG13) from the coleopteran beetle  Tenebrio molitor.Autophagy is a process that is necessary during starvation  as it replenishes metabolic precursors by eliminating damaged organelles. Autophagy is mediated by more than 35 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins that participate in the nucleation  elongation  and curving of the autophagosome membrane. In a pursuit to address the role of autophagy during development and immune resistance of the mealworm beetle  Tenebrio molitor  we screened ATG gene sequences from the whole-larva transcriptome database. We identified a homolog of ATG13 gene in T. molitor (designated as TmATG13) that comprises a cDNA of 1176 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 391 amino acids. Analyses of the structure-specific features of TmAtg13 showed an intrinsically disordered middle and C-terminal region that was rich in regulatory phosphorylation sites. The N-terminal Atg13 domain had a HORMA (Hop1  Rev7  and Mad2) fold containing amino acid residues conserved across the Atg13 insect orthologs. A quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that TmATG13 was expressed ubiquitously during all developmental stages of the insect. TmATG13 mRNA expression was high in the fat body and gut of the larval and adult stages of the insect. The TmATG13 transcripts were expressed at a high level until 6 days of ovarian development  followed by a significant decline. Silencing of ATG13 transcripts in T. molitor larvae showed a reduced survivability of 39 and 38% in response to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Furthermore  the role of TmAtg13 in initiating autophagy as a part of the host cell autophagic complex of the host cells against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is currently under study and will be critical to unfold the structure-function relationships.,Autophagy_notLIR
Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 regulates autophagosome formation in human intestinal cells.Autophagy is a process of central importance for maintaining cell homeostasis  survival  and the regulation of inflammation. Recent studies associated variants within the gene loci  encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2)  and autophagy genes  such as autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1)  with chronic inflammatory disorders  such as Crohn's disease (CD). We show that PTPN2 regulates autophagy in human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and primary colonic lamina propria fibroblasts (CLPF).,Autophagy_notLIR
Purification and characterization of a ubiquitin-like system for autophagosome formation.Autophagy refers to the bulk degradation of cellular proteins and organelles through an autophagosome and plays a pivotal role in the development  cellular differentiation  aging  and elimination of aberrant structures. A failure of autophagy has been implicated in a growing list of mammalian disease states  including cancer and cardiomyopathy. Two ubiquitin-like systems are highly involved in autophagy  especially in the formation of autophagosomes. Here  we purified and characterized Atg7 (an E1-like enzyme)  and Atg3 and Atg10 (E2-like enzymes) in order to gain an insight into the role played by ubiquitin-like systems in the formation of autophagosomes. Interestingly  we observed that Atg7 forms a homodimer to construct an active conformation  unlike other E1-like enzymes. Although Atg3 was detected as a monomer under physiological conditions  Atg10 existed in an oligomeric form  indicating that the mechanism by which Atg10 functions may differ from that of Atg3.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apoptosis and autophagy in mammary gland remodeling and breast cancer chemotherapy.Apoptosis - programmed cell death (PCD) type I is physiological process responsible for cell loss during mammary gland involution after natural weaning or litter removal in rodents  after weaning in sow and during drying off in goat and cow. The regulation of mammary epithelial cell (MEC) apoptosis in bovine mammary gland occurs at three levels. The first level comprises intracellular regulatory proteins  e.g. Bcl-2 family death promoters and inhibitors. The second level is represented by intramammary inductors of apoptosis  e.g. FIL  IGFBPs  Fas ligand  TGF-betas. The expression and activity of these auto/paracrine inductors of apoptosis is controlled and modulated by the third level factors  e.g. systemic galactopoetic hormones  nutrition  reproductive status and milking management. Our recent study proved that apoptosis in involuting bovine mammary gland is accompanied by increased intensity of autophagy  regarded as a cytoprotective process but in advanced stage as a PCD type II. Moreover  we have reported for the first time the ability of TGF-beta(1) to induce both apoptosis and autophagy in bovine BME-UV1 MEC. Much more pronounced heterogeneity of PCD was observed when breast cancer cells were exposed to anticancer drugs. The primary responses of breast cancer MCF-7 cells to camptothecin (CPT) are apoptosis and autophagy (as a cytoprotective process). In this case autophagy occurs in cells which are resistant to apoptosis as a tool of cancer cell survival. The fail-safe responses of breast cancer cells to persisting CPT-induced stress are apoptosis accompanied by morphological and biochemical features of autophagy or type II PCD with advanced subcellular degradation. The threshold between autophagy as a cytoprotective process (reversible) or PCD (irreversible) is difficult to establish and probably depends on the extent of degradation of cellular components. Proapoptotic protein Bid may serve as a molecular switch between apoptosis and autophagy. Bid knock down in MCF-7 cells exposed to CPT leads to a shift of cell death from apoptosis to autophagy. Since bid and other proapoptotic genes undergo mutations in malignant cells  the ability of cancer cells commitment to autophagy may have important therapeutic implications.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysophosphatidic acid inhibits serum deprivation-induced autophagy in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a platelet-enriched bioactive lysophospholipid. By binding to its cognitive G protein-coupled receptors  which are encoded by endothelial differentiation genes (edgs)  LPA regulates various cellular activities including proliferation  survival  and migration. Currently  little is known about the influences of LPA on autophagy  a pivotal mechanism for cell survival during conditions of starvation. Herein we present data indicating that LPA attenuates starvation-induced autophagy  by monitoring the percentage of LC3-II  an autophagy indicator  in human prostate PC-3 cells. In addition  by using cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3  LPA is shown to inhibit the formation of autophagosomes in serum-starved conditions. Our results suggest that in these conditions  LPA inhibits autophagy  which might facilitate early cancer development.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy pathways in glioblastoma.Glioma cells are more likely to respond to therapy through autophagy than through apoptosis. The most efficacious cytotoxic drugs employed in glioma therapy  such as temozolomide and rapamycin  induce autophagy. Oncolytic adenoviruses  which will soon be tested in patients with gliomas at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center  also induce autophagy. Autophagy in gliomas thus represents a promising mechanism that may lead to new glioma therapies. In this chapter  we present the methods for studying autophagy in glioma cells  including assessment of in vitro cellular markers acidic vesicle organelles  and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 punctation; biochemical markers LC3-I/II conversion  p62 degradation  Atg12-Atg5 accumulation  and p70S6K dephosphorylation; and ultrastucture of the autophagosomes. In addition  we will address how LC3B and Atg5 up-regulation during autophagy can be examined through immunostaining in treated tumors and the potential of these proteins for use as surrogate markers to monitor therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Finally  we will discuss the challenges of studying autophagy in gliomas and the future directions of such use.,Autophagy_notLIR
TP53 dysfunction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.The aberrations of TP53 gene and dysregulation of the TP53 pathway are important in the pathogenesis of many human cancers  including malignant lymphomas  especially for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). By regulating many downstream target genes or molecules  TP53 governs major defenses against tumor growth and promotes cellular DNA repair  apoptosis  autophagy  cell cycle arrest  signaling  transcription  immune or inflammatory responses and metabolism. Dysfunction of TP53  including microRNA regulations  copy number alterations of TP53 pathway and TP53 itself  dysregulation of TP53 regulators  and somatic mutations by abnormal TP53 function modes  play an important role in lymphoma generation  progression and invasion. The role of TP53 in DLBCL has been widely explored recently. In this review  we summarized recent advances on different mechanisms of TP53 in DLBCL and new therapeutic approaches to overcome TP53 inactivation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Heavy ion microbeam irradiation induces ultrastructural changes in isolated single fibers of skeletal muscle.The effects of heavy ion microbeams on muscle fibers isolated from mouse skeletal muscles were examined by electron microscopy. The plasma membranes of heavy ion beam-irradiated areas of muscle fibers showed irregular protrusions and invaginations. In the cytoplasm  an irregular distribution of microfilaments was found near the plasma membrane. Sarcoplasmic reticula in the irradiated regions showed a distended appearance with flocculent material within the lumen. These changes were seen as early as 2 min after irradiation  and persisted until as late as 22 min after irradiation. Many autophagic vacuoles could be seen at 7 min after irradiation. At 22 min  the vacuoles became more prominent and showed more variety. These observations suggest that heavy ion beam irradiation causes disruption of the cellular architecture and the autophagy is involved in removal of this disruption.,Autophagy_notLIR
Downregulated adaptor protein p66(Shc) mitigates autophagy process by low nutrient and enhances apoptotic resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.Macroautophagy or autophagy is a lysosome-dependent process in which enzymatic degradation and recycling of cytosolic components occur in stressful contexts. The mechanisms underlying the signaling from starvation to the regulation of autophagy are not fully understood. We previously showed that the Src family member p66(Shc) (focal adhesion-associated 66 kDa isoform of the Src homology and collagen) promotes anoikis and suppresses tumor metastasis via k-Ras-dependent control of proliferation and survival. However  the role of p66(Shc) in low-nutrient-induced autophagy-related pathways remains elusive. In this work  human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were used to further investigate the biological effects of p66(Shc) on autophagy and apoptotic resistance. Here  we show that deficiency of p66(Shc) mitigates the low-nutrient-induced autophagy process in the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain protein 3B (LC3B) conversion  in the number of autophagic vacuoles and in p62/sequestosome 1 protein degradation. However  autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 was not significantly changed during low-nutrient treatment. Furthermore  we found that prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2  but not phosphorylation of Akt is significantly sustained when p66(Shc) expression is inhibited by shRNA. In addition  cleavage of caspase 7 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase  but not caspase 6 and 9 are retarded with this effect compared to the shRNA control cells. Together  these findings suggest the possibility that p66(Shc) plays a pivotal role in coordinately regulating autophagy process and apoptotic resistance in A549 cells under nutrient-limited conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
In vitro reconstitution of plant Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation systems essential for autophagy.Genetic and biochemical analyses using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems  the Atg8 and Atg12 systems  exist and play essential roles in autophagy  the bulk degradation system conserved in yeast and mammals. These conjugation systems are also conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana; however  further detailed study of plant ATG (autophagy-related) conjugation systems in relation to those in yeast and mammals is needed. Here  we describe the in vitro reconstitution of Arabidopsis thaliana ATG8 and ATG12 (AtATG8 and AtATG12) conjugation systems using purified recombinant proteins. AtATG12b was conjugated to AtATG5 in a manner dependent on AtATG7  AtATG10  and ATP  whereas AtATG8a was conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a manner dependent on AtATG7  AtATG3  and ATP. Other AtATG8 homologs (AtATG8b-8i) were similarly conjugated to PE. The AtATG8 conjugates were deconjugated by AtATG4a and AtATG4b. These results support the hypothesis that the ATG conjugation systems in Arabidopsis are very similar to those in yeast and mammals. Intriguingly  in vitro analyses showed that AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates accelerated the formation of AtATG8-PE  whereas AtATG3 inhibited the formation of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates. The in vitro conjugation systems reported here will afford a tool with which to investigate the cross-talk mechanism between two conjugation systems.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy and Lipid Droplets in the Liver.Autophagy is a conserved quality-control pathway that degrades cytoplasmic contents in lysosomes. Autophagy degrades lipid droplets through a process termed lipophagy. Starvation and an acute lipid stimulus increase autophagic sequestration of lipid droplets and their degradation in lysosomes. Accordingly  liver-specific deletion of the autophagy gene Atg7 increases hepatic fat content  mimicking the human condition termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In this review  we provide insights into the molecular regulation of lipophagy  discuss fundamental questions related to the mechanisms by which autophagosomes recognize lipid droplets and how ATG proteins regulate membrane curvature for lipid droplet sequestration  and comment on the possibility of cross talk between lipophagy and cytosolic lipases in lipid mobilization. Finally  we discuss the contribution of lipophagy to the pathophysiology of human fatty liver disease. Understanding how lipophagy clears hepatocellular lipid droplets could provide new ways to prevent fatty liver disease  a major epidemic in developed nations.,Autophagy_notLIR
Combined therapy with m-TOR-dependent and -independent autophagy inducers causes neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Machado-Joseph disease.A major pathological hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders  like polyglutamine disorders (polyQ)  including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)  is the formation of protein aggregates. MJD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene  resulting in an abnormal protein  which is prone to misfolding and forms cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons  ultimately inducing neurodegeneration. Treatment of proteinopathies with drugs that up-regulate autophagy has shown promising results in models of polyQ diseases. Temsirolimus (CCI-779) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR)  while lithium chloride (LiCl) acts by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase  both being able to induce autophagy. We have previously shown that chronic treatment with LiCl (10.4 mg/kg) had limited effects in a transgenic MJD mouse model. Also  others have shown that CCI-779 had mild positive effects in a different mouse model of the disease. It has been suggested that the combination of mTOR-dependent and -independent autophagy inducers could be a more effective therapeutic approach. To further explore this avenue toward therapy  we treated CMVMJD135 transgenic mice with a conjugation of CCI-779 and LiCl  both at concentrations known to induce autophagy and not to be toxic. Surprisingly  this combined treatment proved to be deleterious to both wild-type (wt) and transgenic animals  failing to rescue their neurological symptoms and actually exerting neurotoxic effects. These results highlight the possible dangers of manipulating autophagy in the nervous system and suggest that a better understanding of the potential disruption in the autophagy pathway in MJD is required before successful long-term autophagy modulating therapies can be developed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inflammasome and atherogenesis.Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease starting with accumulation of lipids  lipoproteins  and immune cells in the arterial wall. Inflammation and the innate immune response are involved in the formation of early atherosclerotic lesion. A protein complex known as the inflammasome is stimulated to activate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18  which are responsible for activation of inflammatory processes. Inflammasome-mediated processes are important in the process of atherosclerosis. The front of structure domains as well as IL-1  and IL-18 stands at the threshold of the adaptive immune response that accelerates full-blown atherosclerotic disease progression. This review is intended to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and indicate new potential molecular targets for therapy of this disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Expression and functional importance of innate immune receptors by intestinal epithelial cells.Pattern recognition receptors are somatically encoded and participate in the innate immune responses of a host to microbes. It is increasingly acknowledged that these receptors play a central role both in beneficial and pathogenic interactions with microbes. In particular  these receptors participate actively in shaping the gut environment to establish a fruitful life-long relationship between a host and its microbiota. Commensal bacteria engage Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) to induce specific responses by intestinal epithelial cells such as production of antimicrobial products or of a functional mucus layer. Furthermore  a complex crosstalk between intestinal epithelial cells and the immune system is initiated leading to a mature gut-associated lymphoid tissue to secrete IgA. Impairment in NLR and TLR functionality in epithelial cells is strongly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease  cancer  and with control of the commensal microbiota creating a more favorable environment for the emergence of new infections.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of p38 in irinotecan-induced DNA damage and apoptosis of colon cancer cells.The role of p38 in irinotecan (CPT-11)-induced damage and cell death in colon cancer cell line SW620 was investigated. We demonstrate that CPT-11 treatment activates p38 in exposed cells  however with concentration dependent dynamics and differing consequences. Higher CPT-11 concentrations induce a massive early but relatively short-lasting p38 activity leading to apoptosis mediated by mitochondria and caspases. Pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of p38 then significantly prevents CPT-11-dependent cell death. Conversely  lower CPT-11 concentrations activate p38 in a delayed  however sustained manner  with apoptosis occurring only in a fraction of cells and in the absence of significant autophagy. Blocking p38 in thus treated cells increases their sensitivity toward CPT-11 and increases cell death. In summary  our results confirm the involvement of p38 in colon cancer cells response to CPT-11 while indicating a varying role of p38 in the final biological response.,Autophagy_notLIR
Fasciola hepatica: disruption of spermatogenesis by the fasciolicide compound alpha.Sheep infected with the triclabendazole-susceptible Cullompton isolate of Fasciola hepatica were dosed with 15 mg/kg of compound alpha at 12 weeks post-infection. Adult flukes were recovered from the bile ducts at 24  48  and 72 h post-treatment (p.t.). Changes to the spermatogenic cells in the testis were examined by histology and transmission electron microscopy. Disruption to the testes became increasingly severe over time. The testis tubules shrank in size  became vacuolated  and contained fewer cells. Identification of cell types became difficult  and apoptotic eosinophilic bodies were the predominant feature at 72 h p.t. Changes to the spermatogonia were evident at 24 h p.t.  the cells containing swollen and electron-lucent mitochondria. The proportion of tertiary spermatogonia increased at 48 h p.t.  and they showed signs of autophagy. Multinucleate spermatogonia were a feature of drug treatment at this time point  and they contained autophagic vacuoles. By 72 h p.t.  it was difficult to identify primary and secondary spermatogonia  and there were no recognisable clusters of tertiary spermatogonia. Most spermatogonial cells were multinucleate and in the process of breaking down. With regard to the primary spermatocytes  fragmentation of the cytophore was observed at 24 h p.t. Intact rosettes were rare after 48 h treatment; collections of cells were seen  but were not organised into clusters. By 72 h p.t.  no spermatocyte cells could be recognised. The results indicate that spermatogenesis was severely affected by compound alpha.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inflamed gut mucosa: downstream of interleukin-10.Interleukin-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine  whose main function is limitation and ultimately termination of immune responses. This is especially true for environmental interfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract. IL-10 acts as a key mediator for maintaining gut homeostasis. IL-10 knockout mice are well established as a genetic model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  and sequence variants in the IL-10 locus contribute to ulcerative colitis (UC).,Autophagy_notLIR
Different types of cell death in organismal aging and longevity: state of the art and possible systems biology approach.Cell death is as important as cell proliferation for cell turn-over  and susceptibility to cell death is affected by a number of parameters that change with time. A time-dependent derangement of such a crucial process  or even the simple cell loss mediated by cell death impinges upon aging and longevity. In this review we will discuss how cell death phenomena are modulated during aging and what is their possible role in the aging process. We will focus on apoptosis and autophagy  which affect mostly proliferating and post-mitotic cells  respectively  and on mitochondrial degradation in long living cells. Since the "decisional process" that leads the cell to death is very complex  we will also discuss the possibility to address this topic with a systems biology approach.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of Coatomer Protein I in Virus Replication.Coatomer protein I (COPI) is well known as the protein coat surrounding vesicles involved in returning endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins to the ER. COPI coats are also found in vesicles involved in other trafficking processes including endocytosis  autophagy and anterograde transport in the secretory pathway. In view of the diverse functions of COPI proteins  it is expected that they will affect virus replication  and many reports of such COPI involvement have now appeared. The experimental approaches most often employ specific siRNA to deplete COPI subunits or brefeldin A to block COPI activation. Here we briefly describe the results obtained with viruses in which COPI is found to have a role in replication. The results demonstrate that COPI affects viruses quite differently with effects observed in processes such as entry  RNA replication  and intracellular transport of viral proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
A conserved mechanism of TOR-dependent RCK-mediated mRNA degradation regulates autophagy.Autophagy is an essential eukaryotic pathway requiring tight regulation to maintain homeostasis and preclude disease. Using yeast and mammalian cells  we report a conserved mechanism of autophagy regulation by RNA helicase RCK family members in association with the decapping enzyme Dcp2. Under nutrient-replete conditions  Dcp2 undergoes TOR-dependent phosphorylation and associates with RCK members to form a complex with autophagy-related (ATG) mRNA transcripts  leading to decapping  degradation and autophagy suppression. Simultaneous with the induction of ATG mRNA synthesis  starvation reverses the process  facilitating ATG mRNA accumulation and autophagy induction. This conserved post-transcriptional mechanism modulates fungal virulence and the mammalian inflammasome  the latter providing mechanistic insight into autoimmunity reported in a patient with a PIK3CD/p110δ gain-of-function mutation. We propose a dynamic model wherein RCK family members  in conjunction with Dcp2  function in controlling ATG mRNA stability to govern autophagy  which in turn modulates vital cellular processes affecting inflammation and microbial pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Drosophila parkin requires PINK1 for mitochondrial translocation and ubiquitinates mitofusin.Loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin causes early onset Parkinson's disease  a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. Parkin has been linked to multiple cellular processes including protein degradation  mitochondrial homeostasis  and autophagy; however  its precise role in pathogenesis is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Parkin is recruited to damaged mitochondria  possibly affecting mitochondrial fission and/or fusion  to mediate their autophagic turnover. The precise mechanism of recruitment and the ubiquitination target are unclear. Here we show in Drosophila cells that PINK1 is required to recruit Parkin to dysfunctional mitochondria and promote their degradation. Furthermore  PINK1 and Parkin mediate the ubiquitination of the profusion factor Mfn on the outer surface of mitochondria. Loss of Drosophila PINK1 or parkin causes an increase in Mfn abundance in vivo and concomitant elongation of mitochondria. These findings provide a molecular mechanism by which the PINK1/Parkin pathway affects mitochondrial fission/fusion as suggested by previous genetic interaction studies. We hypothesize that Mfn ubiquitination may provide a mechanism by which terminally damaged mitochondria are labeled and sequestered for degradation by autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase-1 regulates ER stress-induced autophagy.The sphingolipid metabolites ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have recently been implicated in autophagy. In this study  we report that depletion of sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase-1 (SPP1)  an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident enzyme that specifically dephosphorylates S1P  induced autophagy. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin and class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Beclin-1 pathways were not involved and this autophagy was p53 independent  C/EBP homologous protein  BiP  and phospho-eucaryotic translation initiation factor-2α  and cleavage of procaspases 2 and 4  downstream targets of ER stress  were increased after SPP1 depletion. Autophagy was suppressed by depletion of protein kinase regulated by RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)  inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease-1α  or activating transcription factor 6  three sensors of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress. Autophagy triggered by downregulation of SPP1 did not lead to apoptosis but rather stimulated  in a PERK dependent manner  the survival signal Akt  whose inhibition then sensitized cells to apoptosis. Although depletion of SPP1 increased intracellular levels of S1P and its secretion  activation of cell surface S1P receptors did not induce autophagy. Nevertheless  increases in intracellular pools of S1P  but not dihydro-S1P  induced autophagy and ER stress. Thus  SPP1  by regulating intracellular S1P homeostasis  can control the UPR and ER stress-induced autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular cloning and characterization of rat LC3A and LC3B--two novel markers of autophagosome.Rat microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is a homologue of yeast Atg8  an essential component of autophagy. Following synthesis  the C-terminus of rat LC3 is cleaved by a cysteine protease-Atg4  to produce LC3-I  which is located in cytosolic fraction. LC3-I can be converted to LC3-II through the processing by Atg7 (E1-like enzyme) and Atg3 (E2-like enzyme). LC3-II is modified by phosphatidylethanolamine on C-terminus and binds tightly to autophagosomal membrane. Here we reported the cloning of two novel variants of rat LC3  named LC3A and LC3B  respectively  and LC3B is an alternative splicing variant of LC3. LC3A  LC3B  and LC3 showed different expression patterns in rat tissues  suggesting a functional divergence among these proteins. When LC3A and LC3B were overexpressed  both exhibited two forms (18 and 16 kDa  representing types of I and II  separately)  which might be due to post-translational modification including the characteristic C-terminal cleavage at these two proteins as similar to that found in rat LC3 and yeast Atg8. Subcellular localization demonstrated that both LC3A and LC3B are colocalized with LC3 and associated with the autophagic membranes. Mutation analysis further revealed that the conserved Gly120 residues of LC3A and LC3B are essential for their characteristic C-terminal cleavage and localization to autophagic membranes. Present data suggested that LC3A and LC3B could also be used as two novel autophagosomal markers.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy and neurodegeneration.All cellular components are subjected to continuous surveillance by intracellular quality control systems. The major players involved in this quality control are molecular chaperones  which detect the abnormal components  and proteases  which eliminate them from the cell. Malfunctioning of the cellular surveillance systems inexorably leads to cell toxicity  and often cell death  due to the accumulation of unwanted nonfunctional components inside cells. In this work  we review the contribution of the autophagic system to cellular quality control and the consequences that autophagy malfunction has on cellular function. Special emphasis is made on the recently identified role of this system in maintenance of neuronal homeostasis and in the links currently established between alterations in the autophagic system and major neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease  Parkinson's disease  and Huntington's disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Terpinen-4-ol induces autophagic and apoptotic cell death in human leukemic HL-60 cells.Terpinen-4-ol  a monoterpene  is found as the main component of essential oil extracts from many plants.

A systems biology investigation of neurodegenerative dementia reveals a pivotal role of autophagy.Neurodegenerative dementia comprises chronic and progressive illnesses with major clinical features represented by progressive and permanent loss of cognitive and mental performance  including impairment of memory and brain functions. Many different forms of neurodegenerative dementia exist  but they are all characterized by death of specific subpopulation of neurons and accumulation of proteins in the brain. We incorporated data from OMIM and primary molecular targets of drugs in the different phases of the drug discovery process to try to reveal possible hidden mechanism in neurodegenerative dementia. In the present study  a systems biology approach was used to investigate the molecular connections among seemingly distinct complex diseases with the shared clinical symptoms of dementia that could suggest related disease mechanisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
Muscle segmentation in time series images of Drosophila metamorphosis.In order to study genes associated with muscular disorders  we characterize the phenotypic changes in Drosophila muscle cells during metamorphosis caused by genetic perturbations. We collect in vivo images of muscle fibers during remodeling of larval to adult muscles. In this paper  we focus on the new image processing pipeline designed to quantify the changes in shape and size of muscles. We propose a new two-step approach to muscle segmentation in time series images. First  we implement a watershed algorithm to divide the image into edge-preserving regions  and then  we classify these regions into muscle and non-muscle classes on the basis of shape and intensity. The advantage of our method is two-fold: First  better results are obtained because classification of regions is constrained by the shape of muscle cell from previous time point; and secondly  minimal user intervention results in faster processing time. The segmentation results are used to compare the changes in cell size between controls and reduction of the autophagy related gene Atg 9 during Drosophila metamorphosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Beclin 1-independent autophagy induced by a Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 targeting compound  Z18.Inhibitors of Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 can induce autophagy by releasing the autophagic protein Beclin 1 from its complexes with these proteins. Here we report a novel compound targeting the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-XL/Bcl-2  Z18  which efficiently induces autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells  without apparent apoptosis. Unexpectedly  the inhibition of Beclin 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have no obvious effect on Z18-induced autophagy in HeLa cells  implying that it is a non-canonical Beclin 1-independent autophagy. Meanwhile  the accumulation of autophagosomes is positively correlated with Z18-induced cell death and the full flux of autophagy is not necessary.,Autophagy_notLIR

Metabolic contribution of hepatic autophagic proteolysis: old wine in new bottles.Pioneering work on autophagy was achieved soon after the discovery of lysosomes more than 50 years ago. Due to its prominent lysosomal activity and technical ease of handling  the liver has been at the center of continuous and vigorous investigations into autophagy. Many important discoveries  including suppression by insulin and plasma amino acids and stimulation by glucagon  have been made through in vivo and in vitro studies using perfused liver and cultured hepatocytes. The long-term controversy about the origin and nature of the autophagosome membrane has finally led to the conclusion of "phagophore " through extensive molecular cell biological approaches enlightened by the discovery of autophagy-essential ATG genes. Furthermore  recent studies using liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice have thrown light on the unique role of a selective substrate of autophagy  p62. The stabilized p62 accumulating in autophagy-deficient liver manipulates Nrf2-dependent transcription activation through specific binding to Keap1  which results in the elevated gene expression involved in detoxification. This is the first example of the dysregulation of gene expression under autophagy deficiency. Thus  basal liver autophagy makes a large contribution to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and health. Meanwhile  precise comparisons of wild-type and liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice under starvation conditions have revealed that amino acids released by autophagic degradation can be metabolized to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis for the maintenance of blood glucose  and can also be excreted to the circulation to supply serum amino acids. These results strongly confirm that induced liver autophagy plays a pivotal role in metabolic compensation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.,Autophagy_notLIR
Seeing is believing: the impact of electron microscopy on autophagy research.Autophagy was first discovered by transmission electron microscopy more than 50 years ago. For decades  electron microscopy was the only way to reliably detect autophagic compartments in cells because no specific protein markers were known. In the 1970s  however  the introduction of biochemical methods enabled quantitative studies of autophagic-lysosomal degradation  and in the 1980s specific biochemical assays for autophagic sequestration became available. Since the identification of autophagy-related genes in the 1990s  combined fluorescence microscopy  biochemical and genetic methods have taken the leading role in autophagy research. However  electron microscopy is still needed to confirm and verify results obtained by other methods  and also to produce novel knowledge that would not be achievable by any other experimental approach. Confocal microscopy  with its ever-improving resolution  is probably the best-suited morphological approach to investigate the dynamic aspects of autophagy. However  for analyzing the ultrastructural details of the many novel organelles and mechanisms involved in specific subtypes of autophagy  the electron microscope is still indispensable. This review will summarize the impact that electron microscopy has had on autophagy research since the discovery of this self-degradation process in the mid-1950s. Astonishingly  some of the "novel" concepts and principles of autophagy  presented in the recent studies  were already proposed several decades ago by the pioneering  accurate and passionate work of virtuoso electron microscopists.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy in zebrafish.From a hitherto underappreciated phenomenon  autophagy has become one of the most intensively studied cellular processes in recent years. Its role in cellular homeostasis  development and disease is supported by a fast growing body of evidence. Surprisingly  only a small fraction of new observations regarding the physiological functions of cellular "self-digestion" comes from zebrafish  one of the most popular vertebrate model organisms. Here we review the existing information about autophagy reporter lines  genetic knock-down assays and small molecular reagents that have been tested in this system. As we argue  some of these tools have to be used carefully due to possible pleiotropic effects. However  when applied rigorously  in combination with novel mutant strains and genome editing techniques  they could also transform zebrafish into an important animal model of autophagy research.,Autophagy_notLIR
GSK-3β controls autophagy by modulating LKB1-AMPK pathway in prostate cancer cells.Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3B  GSK-3β) is a multi-functional protein kinase involved in various cellular processes and its activity elevates after serum deprivation. We have shown that inhibition of GSK-3β activity triggered a profound autophagic response and subsequent necrotic cell death after serum deprivation in prostate cancer cells. In this study  we dissected the mechanisms involved in GSK-3β inhibition-triggered autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Emerging role of autophagy in pediatric neurodegenerative and neurometabolic diseases.Pediatric neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases that result from specific genetic and biochemical defects. In recent years  studies have revealed a wide spectrum of abnormal cellular functions that include impaired proteolysis  abnormal lipid trafficking  accumulation of lysosomal content  and mitochondrial dysfunction. Within neurons  elaborated degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway are critical for maintaining homeostasis and normal cell function. Recent evidence suggests a pivotal role for autophagy in major adult and pediatric neurodegenerative diseases. We herein review genetic  pathological  and molecular evidence for the emerging link between autophagy dysfunction and lysosomal storage disorders such as Niemann-Pick type C  progressive myoclonic epilepsies such as Lafora disease  and leukodystrophies such as Alexander disease. We also discuss the recent discovery of genetically deranged autophagy in Vici syndrome  a multisystem disorder  and the implications for the role of autophagy in development and disease. Deciphering the exact mechanism by which autophagy contributes to disease pathology may open novel therapeutic avenues to treat neurodegeneration. To this end  an outlook on novel therapeutic approaches targeting autophagy concludes this review.,Autophagy_notLIR
Loss of autophagy in hypothalamic POMC neurons impairs lipolysis.Autophagy degrades cytoplasmic contents to achieve cellular homeostasis. We show that selective loss of autophagy in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons decreases α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) levels  promoting adiposity  impairing lipolysis and altering glucose homeostasis. Ageing reduces hypothalamic autophagy and α-MSH levels  and aged-mice phenocopy  the adiposity and lipolytic defect observed in POMC neuron autophagy-null mice. Intraperitoneal isoproterenol restores lipolysis in both models  demonstrating normal adipocyte catecholamine responsiveness. We propose that an unconventional  autophagosome-mediated form of secretion in POMC neurons controls energy balance by regulating α-MSH production. Modulating hypothalamic autophagy might have implications for preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome of ageing.,Autophagy_notLIR
Induction of autophagy by anthrax lethal toxin.Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved intracellular process whereby cells break down long-lived proteins and organelles. Accumulating evidences suggest increasing physiological significance of autophagy in pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) exerts its influence on numerous cells and herein  we report a novel effect of LT-induced autophagy on mammalian cells. Several autophagy biochemical markers including LC3-II conversion  increased punctuate distribution of GFP-LC3 and development of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) were detected in cells treated with LT. Analysis of individual LT component revealed a moderate increase in LC3-II conversion for protective antigen-treated cells  whereas the LC3-II level in lethal factor-treated cells remained unchanged. In addition  our preliminary findings suggest a protective role of autophagy in LT intoxication as autophagy inhibition resulted in accelerated cell death. This study presents a hitherto undescribed effect of LT-induced autophagy on cells and provides the groundwork for future studies on the implication of autophagy in anthrax pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Does bafilomycin A1 block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes?Bafilomycin A(1) is a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) in cells  and inhibits the acidification of organelles containing this enzyme  such as lysosomes and endosomes. Recently  while editing and reviewing chapters on autophagy for Methods in Enzymology  we noticed repeated references to the effect of bafilomycin A(1) in blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Of course we have seen this in various research papers as well  but reading this routinely in chapters written by various people over a short period of time really caused this to stand out. Every one of these chapters referred to the paper by Yamamoto et al. In that paper  treatment with 100 nM bafilomycin A(1) for 1 h blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in the rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cell line  based on data from electron microscopy. However  data from one of our labs noted an apparently different result in a relatively recent manuscript. Therefore  we decided to look into this more carefully.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and cell growth--the yin and yang of nutrient responses.As a response to nutrient deprivation and other cell stresses  autophagy is often induced in the context of reduced or arrested cell growth. A plethora of signaling molecules and pathways have been shown to have opposing effects on cell growth and autophagy  and results of recent functional screens on a genomic scale support the idea that these processes might represent mutually exclusive cell fates. Understanding the ways in which autophagy and cell growth relate to one another is becoming increasingly important  as new roles for autophagy in tumorigenesis and other growth-related phenomena are uncovered. This Commentary highlights recent findings that link autophagy and cell growth  and explores the mechanisms underlying these connections and their implications for cell physiology and survival. Autophagy and cell growth can inhibit one another through a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms  and can be independently regulated by common signaling pathways. The central role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in regulating both autophagy and cell growth exemplifies one such mechanism. In addition  mTOR-independent signaling and other more direct connections between autophagy and cell growth will also be discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
mTOR Overactivation and Compromised Autophagy in the Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Fibrosis.The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in pulmonary fibrosis was investigated in cell and animal models. mTOR overactivation in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) was achieved in the conditional and inducible Tsc1 knock-down mice SPC-rtTA/TetO-Cre/Tsc1(fx/+) (STT). Doxycycline caused Tsc1 knock-down and consequently mTOR activation in AECs for the STT mice. Mice treated with bleomycin exhibited increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis compared with control mice. In wild-type C57BL/6J mice  pretreatment with rapamycin attenuated the bleomycin-mediated mortality and fibrosis. Rapamycin-mediated mouse survival benefit was inhibited by chloroquine  an autophagy inhibitor. Autophagosomes were decreased in the lungs after bleomycin exposure. Rapamycin induced the production of autophagosomes and diminished p62. We concluded that mTOR overactivation in AECs and compromised autophagy in the lungs are involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The suppression of mTOR and enhancement of autophagy may be used for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.,Autophagy_notLIR

Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) regulates the response to oxidative stress and migration of breast cancer cells.The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a class of heme-containing enzymes involved in phase I metabolism of a large number of xenobiotics. The CYP family member CYP2E1 metabolises many xenobiotics and pro-carcinogens  it is not just expressed in the liver but also in many other tissues such as the kidney  the lung  the brain  the gastrointestinal tract and the breast tissue. It is induced in several pathological conditions including cancer  obesity  and type II diabetes implying that this enzyme is implicated in other biological processes beyond its role in phase I metabolism. Despite the detailed description of the role of CYP2E1 in the liver  its functions in other tissues have not been extensively studied. In this study  we investigated the functional significance of CYP2E1 in breast carcinogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis.The association between altered proteostasis and inflammatory disorders has been increasingly recognized  but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study  we show that deficiency of either autophagy or sequestosome 1 (p62 or SQSTM) led to inflammasome hyperactivation in response to LPS and ATP in primary macrophages and in mice in vivo. Importantly  induction of protein misfolding by puromycin  thapsigargin  or geldanamycin resulted in inflammasome activation that was more pronounced in autophagy- or p62-deficient macrophages. Accumulation of misfolded proteins caused inflammasome activation by inducing generation of nonmitochondrial reactive oxygen species and lysosomal damage  leading to release of cathepsin B. Our results suggest that altered proteostasis results in inflammasome activation and thus provide mechanisms for the association of altered proteostasis with inflammatory disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Wss1 metalloprotease partners with Cdc48/Doa1 in processing genotoxic SUMO conjugates.Sumoylation during genotoxic stress regulates the composition of DNA repair complexes. The yeast metalloprotease Wss1 clears chromatin-bound sumoylated proteins. Wss1 and its mammalian analog  DVC1/Spartan  belong to minigluzincins family of proteases. Wss1 proteolytic activity is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding. Wss1 is required for cell survival following UV irradiation  the smt3-331 mutation and Camptothecin-induced formation of covalent topoisomerase 1 complexes (Top1cc). Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with the AAA ATPase Cdc48 and an adaptor  Doa1. Upon DNA damage Wss1/Cdc48/Doa1 is recruited to sumoylated targets and catalyzes SUMO chain extension through a newly recognized SUMO ligase activity. Activation of Wss1 results in metalloprotease self-cleavage and proteolysis of associated proteins. In cells lacking Tdp1  clearance of topoisomerase covalent complexes becomes SUMO and Wss1-dependent. Upon genotoxic stress  Wss1 is vacuolar  suggesting a link between genotoxic stress and autophagy involving the Doa1 adapter.,Autophagy_notLIR
PIPing on lysosome tubes.EMBO J (2013) 32  324–339 doi:; DOI: 10.1038/emboj.2012.341; published online December 21 2012 The role of lysosomes in important cellular responses  including phagocytosis  cell surface repair  and autophagy underlies a number of human diseases. Furthermore  the role of the lysosomal surface in TORC1 signalling has revealed unexpected properties of these organelles. In this issue  Sridhar et al (2013) uncover an important role for PI(4)P for lysosome function under normal nutrient conditions and after prolonged nutrient deprivation. Ana Maria Cuervo  the late Dennis Shields  and colleagues (Sridhar et al  2013) conclude that PI4 kinase IIIβ on the surface of the lysosome controls the fidelity of sorting from the lysosome  and is required for autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR). These novel findings provide important insights into the complexities of the lipid composition of the lysosome  and how these lipids may control lysosome function.,Autophagy_notLIR
The yeast autophagy protease Atg4 is regulated by thioredoxin.Autophagy is a membrane-trafficking process whereby double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes engulf and deliver intracellular material to the vacuole for degradation. Atg4 is a cysteine protease with an essential function in autophagosome formation. Mounting evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species may play a role in the control of autophagy and could regulate Atg4 activity but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In this study  we showed that reactive oxygen species activate autophagy in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and unraveled the molecular mechanism by which redox balance controls Atg4 activity. A combination of biochemical assays  redox titrations  and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Atg4 is regulated by oxidoreduction of a single disulfide bond between Cys338 and Cys394. This disulfide has a low redox potential and is very efficiently reduced by thioredoxin  suggesting that this oxidoreductase plays an important role in Atg4 regulation. Accordingly  we found that autophagy activation by rapamycin was more pronounced in a thioredoxin mutant compared with wild-type cells. Moreover  in vivo studies indicated that Cys338 and Cys394 are required for the proper regulation of autophagosome biogenesis  since mutation of these cysteines resulted in increased recruitment of Atg8 to the phagophore assembly site. Thus  we propose that the fine-tuning of Atg4 activity depending on the intracellular redox state may regulate autophagosome formation.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Alzheimer's β-secretase BACE1 localizes to normal presynaptic terminals and to dystrophic presynaptic terminals surrounding amyloid plaques.β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase that initiates Aβ production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 levels are increased in AD  which could contribute to pathogenesis  yet the mechanism of BACE1 elevation is unclear. Furthermore  the normal function of BACE1 is poorly understood. We localized BACE1 in the brain at both the light and electron microscopic levels to gain insight into normal and pathophysiologic roles of BACE1 in health and AD  respectively. Our findings provide the first ultrastructural evidence that BACE1 localizes to vesicles (likely endosomes) in normal hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of both non-transgenic and APP transgenic (5XFAD) mouse brains. In some instances  BACE1-positive vesicles were located near active zones  implying a function for BACE1 at the synapse. In addition  BACE1 accumulated in swollen dystrophic autophagosome-poor presynaptic terminals surrounding amyloid plaques in 5XFAD cortex and hippocampus. Importantly  accumulations of BACE1 and APP co-localized in presynaptic dystrophies  implying increased BACE1 processing of APP in peri-plaque regions. In primary cortical neuron cultures  treatment with the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin caused BACE1 levels to increase; however  exposure of neurons to the autophagy inducer trehalose did not reduce BACE1 levels. This suggests that BACE1 is degraded by lysosomes but not by autophagy. Our results imply that BACE1 elevation in AD could be linked to decreased lysosomal degradation of BACE1 within dystrophic presynaptic terminals. Elevated BACE1 and APP levels in plaque-associated presynaptic dystrophies could increase local peri-plaque Aβ generation and accelerate amyloid plaque growth in AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
The energy sensing LKB1-AMPK pathway regulates p27(kip1) phosphorylation mediating the decision to enter autophagy or apoptosis.Nutrients and bioenergetics are prerequisites for proliferation and survival of mammalian cells. We present evidence that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1)  is phosphorylated at Thr 198 downstream of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome protein-AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1-AMPK) energy-sensing pathway  thereby increasing p27 stability and directly linking sensing of nutrient concentration and bioenergetics to cell-cycle progression. Ectopic expression of wild-type and phosphomimetic Thr 198 to Asp 198 (T198D)  but not unstable Thr 198 to Ala 198 (p27(T198A)) is sufficient to induce autophagy. Under stress conditions that activate the LKB1-AMPK pathway with subsequent induction of autophagy  p27 knockdown results in apoptosis. Thus LKB1-AMPK pathway-dependent phosphorylation of p27 at Thr 198 stabilizes p27 and permits cells to survive growth factor withdrawal and metabolic stress through autophagy. This may contribute to tumour-cell survival under conditions of growth factor deprivation  disrupted nutrient and energy metabolism  or during stress of chemotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Stathmin interaction with a putative kinase and coiled-coil-forming protein domains.Stathmin is a ubiquitous  cytosolic 19-kDa protein  which is phosphorylated on up to four sites in response to many regulatory signals within cells. Its molecular characterization indicates a functional organization including an N-terminal regulatory domain that bears the phosphorylation sites  linked to a putative alpha-helical binding domain predicted to participate in coiled-coil  protein-protein interactions. We therefore proposed that stathmin may play the role of a relay integrating diverse intracellular regulatory pathways; its action on various target proteins would be a function of its combined phosphorylation state. To search for such target proteins  we used the two-hybrid screen in yeast  with stathmin as a "bait." We isolated and characterized four cDNAs encoding protein domains that interact with stathmin in vivo. One of the corresponding proteins was identified as BiP  a member of the hsp70 heat-shock protein family. Another is a previously unidentified  putative serine/threonine kinase  KIS  which might be regulated by stathmin or  more likely  be part of the kinases controlling its phosphorylation state. Finally  two clones code for subdomains of two proteins  CC1 and CC2  predicted to form alpha-helices participating in coiled-coil interacting structures. Their isolation by interaction screening further supports our model for the regulatory function of stathmin through coiled-coil interactions with diverse downstream targets via its presumed alpha-helical binding domain. The molecular and biological characterization of KIS  CC1  and CC2 proteins will give further insights into the molecular functions and mechanisms of action of stathmin as a relay of integrated intracellular regulatory pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hox proteins mediate developmental and environmental control of autophagy.Hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved transcription factors  providing positional information used for differential morphogenesis along the anteroposterior axis. Here  we show that Drosophila Hox proteins are potent repressors of the autophagic process. In inhibiting autophagy  Hox proteins display no apparent paralog specificity and do not provide positional information. Instead  they impose temporality on developmental autophagy and act as effectors of environmental signals in starvation-induced autophagy. Further characterization establishes that temporality is controlled by Pontin  a facultative component of the Brahma chromatin remodeling complex  and that Hox proteins impact on autophagy by repressing the expression of core components of the autophagy machinery. Finally  the potential of central and posterior mouse Hox proteins to inhibit autophagy in Drosophila and in vertebrate COS-7 cells indicates that regulation of autophagy is an evolutionary conserved feature of Hox proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Two-tiered control of epithelial growth and autophagy by the insulin receptor and the ret-like receptor  stitcher.Body size in Drosophila larvae  like in other animals  is controlled by nutrition. Nutrient restriction leads to catabolic responses in the majority of tissues  but the Drosophila mitotic imaginal discs continue growing. The nature of these differential control mechanisms that spare distinct tissues from starvation are poorly understood. Here  we reveal that the Ret-like receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)  Stitcher (Stit)  is required for cell growth and proliferation through the PI3K-I/TORC1 pathway in the Drosophila wing disc. Both Stit and insulin receptor (InR) signaling activate PI3K-I and drive cellular proliferation and tissue growth. However  whereas optimal growth requires signaling from both InR and Stit  catabolic changes manifested by autophagy only occur when both signaling pathways are compromised. The combined activities of Stit and InR in ectodermal epithelial tissues provide an RTK-mediated  two-tiered reaction threshold to varying nutritional conditions that promote epithelial organ growth even at low levels of InR signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Modulation of P2X4/P2X7/Pannexin-1 sensitivity to extracellular ATP via Ivermectin induces a non-apoptotic and inflammatory form of cancer cell death.Overexpression of P2X7 receptors correlates with tumor growth and metastasis. Yet  release of ATP is associated with immunogenic cancer cell death as well as inflammatory responses caused by necrotic cell death at sites of trauma or ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using an FDA-approved anti-parasitic agent Ivermectin as a prototype agent to allosterically modulate P2X4 receptors  we can switch the balance between the dual pro-survival and cytotoxic functions of purinergic signaling in breast cancer cells. This is mediated through augmented opening of the P2X4/P2X7-gated Pannexin-1 channels that drives a mixed apoptotic and necrotic mode of cell death associated with activation of caspase-1 and is consistent with pyroptosis. We show that cancer cell death is dependent on ATP release and death signals downstream of P2X7 receptors that can be reversed by inhibition of NADPH oxidases-generated ROS  Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Ivermectin induces autophagy and release of ATP and HMGB1  key mediators of inflammation. Potentiated P2X4/P2X7 signaling can be further linked to the ATP rich tumor microenvironment providing a mechanistic explanation for the tumor selectivity of purinergic receptors modulation and its potential to be used as a platform for integrated cancer immunotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitophagy in yeast occurs through a selective mechanism.The regulation of mitochondrial degradation through autophagy is expected to be a tightly controlled process  considering the significant role of this organelle in many processes ranging from energy production to cell death. However  very little is known about the specific nature of the degradation process. We developed a new method to detect mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) by fusing the green fluorescent protein at the C terminus of two endogenous mitochondrial proteins and monitored vacuolar release of green fluorescent protein. Using this method  we screened several atg mutants and found that ATG11  a gene that is essential only for selective autophagy  is also essential for mitophagy. In addition  we found that mitophagy is blocked even under severe starvation conditions  if the carbon source makes mitochondria essential for metabolism. These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles are largely protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 lowers proliferation and induces macroautophagy in colon cancer cells.Evolving evidence supports that cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) takes part in colon carcinogenesis. The effects of COX-1 inhibition on colon cancer cells  however  remains obscured. In this study  we demonstrate that COX-1 inhibitor sc-560 inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation with concomitant G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with down-regulation of c-Fos  cyclin E(2) and E(2)F-1 and up-regulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). In addition  sc-560 induced macroautophagy  an emerging mechanism of tumor suppression  as evidenced by the formation of LC3(+) autophagic vacuoles  enhanced LC3 processing  and the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles and autolysosomes. In this connection  3-methyladenine  a Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor  significantly abolished the formation of LC3(+) autophagic vacuoles and the processing of LC3 induced by sc-560. To conclude  this study reveals the unreported relationship between COX-1 and proliferation/macroautophagy of colon cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
APP overexpression in the absence of NPC1 exacerbates metabolism of amyloidogenic proteins of Alzheimer's disease.Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides originating from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cellular cholesterol levels/distribution can regulate production and clearance of Aβ peptides  albeit with contradictory outcomes. To better understand the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and APP/Aβ metabolism  we have recently generated a bigenic ANPC mouse line overexpressing mutant human APP in the absence of Niemann-Pick type C-1 protein required for intracellular cholesterol transport. Using this unique bigenic ANPC mice and complementary stable N2a cells  we have examined the functional consequences of cellular cholesterol sequestration in the endosomal-lysosomal system  a major site of Aβ production  on APP/Aβ metabolism and its relation to neuronal viability. Levels of APP C-terminal fragments (α-CTF/β-CTF) and Aβ peptides  but not APP mRNA/protein or soluble APPα/APPβ  were increased in ANPC mouse brains and N2a-ANPC cells. These changes were accompanied by reduced clearance of peptides and an increased level/activity of γ-secretase  suggesting that accumulation of APP-CTFs is due to decreased turnover  whereas increased Aβ levels may result from a combination of increased production and decreased turnover. APP-CTFs and Aβ peptides were localized primarily in early-/late-endosomes and to some extent in lysosomes/autophagosomes. Cholesterol sequestration impaired endocytic-autophagic-lysosomal  but not proteasomal  clearance of APP-CTFs/Aβ peptides. Moreover  markers of oxidative stress were increased in vulnerable brain regions of ANPC mice and enhanced β-CTF/Aβ levels increased susceptibility of N2a-ANPC cells to H2O2-induced toxicity. Collectively  our results show that cellular cholesterol sequestration plays a key role in APP/Aβ metabolism and increasing neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress in AD-related pathology.,Autophagy_notLIR
Production of free methylarginines via the proteasome and autophagy pathways in cultured cells.ω-NG-monomethylarginine (MMA) and asymmetric ω-NG  ω-NG-dimethylarginine (ADMA)  are endogenous competitive inhibitors for three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Although free methylarginines are thought to be liberated through the intracellular proteolysis of proteins methylated by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs)  the degradation pathways of the arginine-methylated proteins involved in the biosynthesis of free methylarginines have yet to be determined. In this study  the biosynthesis of free methylarginines with cultured cells was analyzed as follows: first  we established a method for quantifying trace amounts of free intracellular methylarginines by means of ultra high‑performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Second  we determined the type of methylation produced in the cultured cell lines using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-QIT-TOF/MS). Finally  we investigated whether methylarginines are generated via the proteasome and autophagy pathways  the primary intracellular protein degradation systems. By using specific inhibitors for each pathway  we found that the blockade of proteasome activity reduced the amount of free ADMA and symmetric ω-NG  ω-N'G-dimethylarginine (SDMA)  while the inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced cellular ADMA only. These results suggest that both the proteasome and autophagy pathways play an essential role in the production of free methylarginines.,Autophagy_notLIR
The proteolytic landscape of the yeast vacuole.The vacuole in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> plays a number of essential roles  and to provide some of these required functions the vacuole harbors at least seven distinct proteases. These proteases exhibit a range of activities and different classifications  and they follow unique paths to arrive at their ultimate  common destination in the cell. This review will first summarize the major functions of the yeast vacuole and delineate how proteins are targeted to this organelle. We will then describe the specific trafficking itineraries and activities of the characterized vacuolar proteases  and outline select features of a new member of this protease ensemble. Finally  we will entertain the question of why so many proteases evolved and reside in the vacuole  and what future research challenges exist in the field.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inactivation of Snt2  a BAH/PHD-containing transcription factor  impairs pathogenicity and increases autophagosome abundance in Fusarium oxysporum.The soil-borne  asexual fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. melonis (FOM) is a causal agent of muskmelon wilt disease. The current study focused on the most virulent race of FOM-race 1 2. The tagged mutant D122  generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  caused the delayed appearance of initial wilt disease symptoms  as well as a 75% reduction in pathogenicity. D122 was impaired in the gene product homologous to the Snt2-like transcription factor of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Involvement of snt2 in the early stage of FOM pathogenesis and its requirement for host colonization were confirmed by targeted disruption followed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of snt2 expression in planta. Δsnt2 mutants of FOM and Neurospora crassa exhibited similar morphological abnormalities  including a reduction in conidia production and biomass accumulation  slower vegetative growth and frequent hyphal septation. In N. crassa  snt-2 is required for sexual development  as Δsnt-2 mutants were unable to produce mature perithecia. Suppressive subtraction hybridization analysis of the D122 mutant versus wild-type isolate detected four genes (idi4  pdc  msf1  eEF1G) that were found previously in association with the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway. Expression of the autophagy-related idi4 and pdc genes was found to be up-regulated in the Δsnt2 FOM mutant. In N. crassa  disruption of snt-2 also conferred a significant over-expression of idi4.,Autophagy_notLIR
LC3  a microtubule-associated protein1A/B light chain3  is involved in cytoplasmic lipid droplet formation.The cytoplasmic lipid droplet (LD) is one of organelles that has a neutral lipid core with a single phospholipid layer. LDs are believed to be generated between the two leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and to play various roles  such as high effective energy storage. However  it remains largely unknown how LDs are generated and grow in the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that the Atg conjugation system that is essential for autophagosome formation is involved in LD formation in hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes. We show here that LC3 itself is involved in LD formation by using RNA interference (RNAi). All cultured cell lines examined  in which the expression of LC3 was suppressed by RNAi  showed reduced LD formation. Triacylglycerol  a major component of LDs  was synthesized and degraded in LC3 mRNA-knockdown cells as well as in control cells. Interestingly  potential of the bulk protein degradation in the knockdown-cells was also evident in the control cells. These findings indicate that LC3 is involved in the LD formation regardless of the bulk degradation  and that LC3 has two pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis mediated by autophagy and lipid metabolism.,Autophagy_notLIR
IL23R R381Q and ATG16L1 T300A are strongly associated with Crohn's disease in a study of New Zealand Caucasians with inflammatory bowel disease.Recently  separate genome-wide association analyses have identified nonsynonymous SNPs in IL23R and ATG16L1 (rs11209026; c1142G>A  R381Q  and rs2241880; c1338A>G  T300A  respectively) as strong candidate susceptibility factors for Crohn's disease (CD) in whites. The aim of our study was to test whether these SNPs are associated with CD in a population-based cohort of New Zealand Caucasian inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Differentiation-dependent autophagy controls the fate of newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins in the colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cell line.Our previous results have demonstrated that  in undifferentiated human colon cancer HT-29 cells  a pool of glycoproteins bearing high-mannose oligosaccharides rapidly escapes the exocytic pathway to be degraded in the lysosomal compartment [Trugnan  Ogier-Denis  Sapin  Darmoul  Bauvy  Aubery and Codogno (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266  20849-20855]. We report here on the mechanism that governs this degradative pathway. Using pulse-chase experiments in combination with subcellular fractionation  we have observed that the sequestration of high-mannose glycoproteins in lysosomes was impaired by drugs which interfere with the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. The accumulation of high-mannose glycoproteins in the lysosomal fraction was shown to be part of the general autophagic pathway constitutively expressed in undifferentiated cells  as independently measured by the sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and electroloaded raffinose. Furthermore  when HT-29 cells were cultured under differentiation-permissive conditions  the decreased accumulation of high-mannose glycoproteins in the lysosomal compartment was correlated with the decrease in autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
To be or not to be? How selective autophagy and cell death govern cell fate.The health of metazoan organisms requires an effective response to organellar and cellular damage either by repair of such damage and/or by elimination of the damaged parts of the cells or the damaged cell in its entirety. Here  we consider the progress that has been made in the last few decades in determining the fates of damaged organelles and damaged cells through discrete  but genetically overlapping  pathways involving the selective autophagy and cell death machinery. We further discuss the ways in which the autophagy machinery may impact the clearance and consequences of dying cells for host physiology. Failure in the proper removal of damaged organelles and/or damaged cells by selective autophagy and cell death processes is likely to contribute to developmental abnormalities  cancer  aging  inflammation  and other diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
BH3-mimetics- and cisplatin-induced cell death proceeds through different pathways depending on the availability of death-related cellular components.Owing to their important function in regulating cell death  pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 proteins by dubbed BH3-mimetics is a promising strategy for apoptosis induction or sensitization to chemotherapy. However  the role of Apaf-1  the main protein constituent of the apoptosome  in the process has yet not been analyzed. Furthermore as new chemotherapeutics develop  the possible chemotherapy-induced toxicity to rapidly dividing normal cells  especially sensitive differentiated cells  has to be considered. Such undesirable effects would probably be ameliorated by selectively and locally inhibiting apoptosis in defined sensitive cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genetics and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.Recent advances have provided substantial insight into the maintenance of mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Cellular programs responsible for intestinal homeostasis use diverse intracellular and intercellular networks to promote immune tolerance  inflammation or epithelial restitution. Complex interfaces integrate local host and microbial signals to activate appropriate effector programs selectively and even drive plasticity between these programs. In addition  genetic studies and mouse models have emphasized the role of genetic predispositions and how they affect interactions with microbial and environmental factors  leading to pro-colitogenic perturbations of the host-commensal relationship.,Autophagy_notLIR
The neuroprotective effect of modified Yeoldahanso-tang via autophagy enhancement in models of Parkinson's disease.Modified Yeoldahanso-tang (MYH) is a Korean herbal formula  containing 10 herbs: Pueraria lobata (Willd.)

MYH has been used to treat amnesia  hypochondria and dementia in Korea. In this study  we explored the possibility of using MYH in the prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically  we made an effort to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of MYH using experimental methods similar to those used in a recent study of PD.,Autophagy_notLIR

Insects recycle endosymbionts when the benefit is over.Symbiotic associations are widespread in nature and represent a driving force in evolution. They are known to impact fitness  and thereby shape the host phenotype. Insects subsisting on nutritionally poor substrates have evolved mutualistic relationships with intracellular symbiotic bacteria (endosymbionts) that supply them with metabolic components lacking in their diet. In many species  endosymbionts are hosted within specialized host cells  called the bacteriocytes  and transmitted vertically across host generations. How hosts balance the costs and benefits of having endosymbionts  and whether and how they adjust symbiont load to their physiological needs  remains largely unexplored. By investigating the cereal weevil Sitophilus association with the Sodalis pierantonius endosymbiont  we discover that endosymbiont populations intensively multiply in young adults  before being rapidly eliminated within few days. We show that young adults strongly depend on endosymbionts and that endosymbiont proliferation after metamorphosis matches a drastic host physiological need for the tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe) amino acids to rapidly build their protective exoskeleton. Tyr and Phe are precursors of the dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) molecule that is an essential component for the cuticle synthesis. Once the cuticle is achieved  DOPA reaches high amounts in insects  which triggers endosymbiont elimination. This elimination relies on apoptosis and autophagy activation  allowing digestion and recycling of the endosymbiont material. Thus  the weevil-endosymbiont association reveals an adaptive interplay between metabolic and cellular functions that minimizes the cost of symbiosis and speeds up the exoskeleton formation during a critical phase when emerging adults are especially vulnerable.,Autophagy_notLIR
Protein maturation and proteolysis in plant plastids  mitochondria  and peroxisomes.Plastids  mitochondria  and peroxisomes are key organelles with dynamic proteomes in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Their biogenesis and activity must be coordinated and require intraorganellar protein maturation  degradation  and recycling. The three organelles together are predicted to contain ∼200 presequence peptidases  proteases  aminopeptidases  and specific protease chaperones/adaptors  but the substrates and substrate selection mechanisms are poorly understood. Similarly  lifetime determinants of organellar proteins  such as N-end degrons and tagging systems  have not been identified  but the substrate recognition mechanisms likely share similarities between organelles. Novel degradomics tools for systematic analysis of protein lifetime and proteolysis could define such protease-substrate relationships  degrons  and protein lifetime. Intraorganellar proteolysis is complemented by autophagy of whole organelles or selected organellar content  as well as by cytosolic protein ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. This review summarizes (putative) plant organellar protease functions and substrate-protease relationships. Examples illustrate key proteolytic events.,Autophagy_notLIR
Liver autophagy in the influenza B virus model of Reye's syndrome in mice.Biochemical evidence is presented for the autophagic destruction of liver mitochondria in the influenza B virus model of Reye's syndrome in mice. Separation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles from mitochondria was accomplished by prior treatment of the mice with Triton WR-1339  resulting in uptake of detergent by these organelles (tritosomes)  reducing their densities. The organelles were banded in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Total protein in the heavy tritosomal fraction increased from 1-2% in controls to 7-8% in virus-treated animals. Ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OCTase)  a mitochondrial marker  increased from 2-3% (controls) to 11-15% (virus-treated)  and glucose-6-phosphatase  a marker for endoplasmic reticulum  increased from 1-2% (controls) to 8-10% (virus-treated). beta-Galactosidase  a soluble enzyme in the lysosome  and OCTase also increase in the cell extract fraction following virus treatment  indicating that there was turnover of heavy lysosomal contents.,Autophagy_notLIR
Use of protease inhibitors for detecting autophagy in plants.In cultured tobacco (BY-2) cells  autophagy seems to be induced under nutrient-starvation conditions  whereas in root cells from Arabidopsis and barley  it occurs constitutively though is activated under nutrient starvation conditions. In both cases  protease inhibitors such as E-64  E-64c  antipain  and leupeptin block autophagy at the step of degradation of the cytoplasm enclosed in lysosomes/vacuoles  and cause the accumulation of autolysosomes (lysosomes containing parts of the cytoplasm) and/or of many cytoplasmic inclusions in the central vacuoles. Both types of autophagy are inhibited by 3-methyladenine  which is known as a potent inhibitor of autophagy in mammalian cells. Thus  using protease inhibitors and 3-methyladenine provides us with a method useful for analyzing autophagy in plant cells. This chapter describes protocols for detecting autophagic compartments in BY-2 cells and in the root-tip cells of Arabidopsis and barley by microscopy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy facilitates the development of breast cancer resistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.Autophagy has been emerging as a novel cytoprotective mechanism to increase tumor cell survival under conditions of metabolic stress and hypoxia as well as to escape chemotherapy-induced cell death. To elucidate whether autophagy might also protect cancer cells from the growth inhibitory effects of targeted therapies  we evaluated the autophagic status of preclinical breast cancer models exhibiting auto-acquired resistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Tzb). We first examined the basal autophagic levels in Tzb-naive SKBR3 cells and in two pools of Tzb-conditioned SKBR3 cells (TzbR)  which optimally grow in the presence of Tzb doses as high as 200 microg/ml Tzb. Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that the number of punctate LC3 structures -a hallmark of autophagy- was drastically higher in Tzb-refractory cells than in Tzb-sensitive SKBR3 parental cells. Immunoblotting analyses confirmed that the lipidation product of the autophagic conversion of LC3 was accumulated to high levels in TzbR cells. High levels of the LC3 lipidated form in Tzb-refractory cells were accompanied by decreased p62/sequestosome-1 protein expression  a phenomenon characterizing the occurrence of increased autophagic flux. Moreover  increased autophagy was actively used to survive Tzb therapy as TzbR pools were exquisitely sensitive to chemical inhibitors of autophagosomal formation/function. Knockdown of LC3 expression via siRNA similarly resulted in reduced TzbR cell proliferation and supra-additively interacted with Tzb to re-sensitize TzbR cells. Sub-groups of Tzb-naive SKBR3 parental cells accumulated LC3 punctate structures and decreased p62 expression after treatment with high-dose Tzb  likely promoting their own resistance. This is the first report showing that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells chronically exposed to Tzb exhibit a bona fide up-regulation of the autophagic activity that efficiently works to protect breast cancer cells from the growth-inhibitory effects of Tzb. Therapeutic targeting autophagosome formation/function might represent a novel molecular avenue to reduce the emergence of Tzb resistance in HER2-dependent breast carcinomas.,Autophagy_notLIR
Low concentration of mercury induces autophagic cell death in rat hepatocytes.In the present study  we attempted to elucidate the induction of autophagy in rat hepatocytes by a low concentration of mercury. Hepatocytes treated with different doses of mercuric chloride (HgCl2; 1  2.5  5 and 10 µM) and at different time intervals (0 min  30 min  1 h  2 h and 4 h) show autophagic cell death only at 5 µM HgCl2 within 30 min of incubation. At 1 and 2.5 µM HgCl2  no cell death is recorded  while apoptosis is found at 10 µM HgCl2  as evidenced by the activation of caspase 3. Autophagic cell death is confirmed by the presence of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) positive hepatocytes which is found to be highest at 1 h. Atg5-Atg12 covalent-conjugation triggers the autophagic pathway within 30 min of 5 µM HgCl2 treatment and continues till 4 h of incubation. In addition  damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM) expression gradually increases from 30 min to 4 h of treatment with mercury and a corresponding linear decrease in p53 has been observed. It is concluded that a low concentration (5 µM HgCl2) of mercury induces autophagy or nonapoptotic programmed cell death following an Atg5-Atg12 covalent-conjugation pathway  which is modulated by DRAM in a p53-dependent manner.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dendritic spinopathy in transgenic mice expressing ALS/dementia-linked mutant UBQLN2.Mutations in the gene encoding ubiquilin2 (UBQLN2) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  frontotemporal type of dementia  or both. However  the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here  we show that ALS/dementia-linked UBQLN2(P497H) transgenic mice develop neuronal pathology with ubiquilin2/ubiquitin/p62-positive inclusions in the brain  especially in the hippocampus  recapitulating several key pathological features of dementia observed in human patients with UBQLN2 mutations. A major feature of the ubiquilin2-related pathology in these mice  and reminiscent of human disease  is a dendritic spinopathy with protein aggregation in the dendritic spines and an associated decrease in dendritic spine density and synaptic dysfunction. Finally  we show that the protein inclusions in the dendritic spines are composed of several components of the proteasome machinery  including Ub(G76V)-GFP  a representative ubiquitinated protein substrate that is accumulated in the transgenic mice. Our data  therefore  directly link impaired protein degradation to inclusion formation that is associated with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. These data imply a convergent molecular pathway involving synaptic protein recycling that may also be involved in other neurodegenerative disorders  with implications for development of widely applicable rational therapeutics.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tsc1 (hamartin) confers neuroprotection against ischemia by inducing autophagy.Previous attempts to identify neuroprotective targets by studying the ischemic cascade and devising ways to suppress it have failed to translate to efficacious therapies for acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that studying the molecular determinants of endogenous neuroprotection in two well-established paradigms  the resistance of CA3 hippocampal neurons to global ischemia and the tolerance conferred by ischemic preconditioning (IPC)  would reveal new neuroprotective targets. We found that the product of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 gene (TSC1)  hamartin  is selectively induced by ischemia in hippocampal CA3 neurons. In CA1 neurons  hamartin was unaffected by ischemia but was upregulated by IPC preceding ischemia  which protects the otherwise vulnerable CA1 cells. Suppression of hamartin expression with TSC1 shRNA viral vectors both in vitro and in vivo increased the vulnerability of neurons to cell death following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and ischemia. In vivo  suppression of TSC1 expression increased locomotor activity and decreased habituation in a hippocampal-dependent task. Overexpression of hamartin increased resistance to OGD by inducing productive autophagy through an mTORC1-dependent mechanism.,Autophagy_notLIR
A cluster of thin tubular structures mediates transformation of the endoplasmic reticulum to autophagic isolation membrane.Recent findings have suggested that the autophagic isolation membrane (IM) might originate from a domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the omegasome. However  the morphological relationships between ER  omegasome  and IM remain unclear. In the present study  we found that hybrid structures composed of a double FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (DFCP1)-positive omegasome and the IM accumulated in Atg3-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Moreover  correlative light and electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DFCP1 was localized on tubular or vesicular elements adjacent to the IM rims. Through detailed morphological analyses  including optimization of a fixation method and electron tomography  we observed a cluster of thin tubular structures between the IM edges and ER  part of which were continuous with IM and/or ER. The formation of these thin tubular clusters was observed in several cell lines and MEFs deficient for Atg5  Atg7  or Atg16L1 but not in FIP200-deficient cells  suggesting that they were relevant to the earlier events in autophagosome formation. Taken together  our findings indicate that these tubular profiles represent a part of the omegasome that links the ER with the IM.,Autophagy_notLIR
Insights into the relationship between the proteasome and autophagy in human and yeast cells.In eukaryotes  the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are two major intracellular protein degradation pathways. Several lines of evidence support the emerging concept of a coordinated and complementary relationship between these two processes  and a particularly interesting finding is that the inhibition of the proteasome induces autophagy. Yet  there is limited knowledge of the regulation of the UPS by autophagy. In this study  we show that the disruption of ATG5 and ATG32 genes in yeast cells under both nutrient-deficient conditions as well as stress that causes mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an activation of proteasome. The same scenario occurs after pharmacological inhibition of basal autophagy in cultured human cells. Our findings underline the view that the two processes are interconnected and tend to compensate  to some extent  for each other's functions.,Autophagy_notLIR

HMGB1 modulates Lewis cell autophagy and promotes cell survival via RAGE-HMGB1-Erk1/2 positive feedback during nutrient depletion.Autophagy is a self-digesting mechanism responsible for the removal of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles by lysosomes. It also allows cells to survive during nutrient depletion and/or in the absence of growth factors. High-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a highly-conserved nuclear protein that has been associated with cell autophagy; however  the mechanisms responsible for this role remain unclear. Many reports have demonstrated that autophagy represents a survival strategy for tumor cells during nutrient depletion  oxidative stress and DNA damage. In the present study  we explored the mechanisms whereby HMGB1 regulates tumor cell autophagy during nutrient depletion (the cells were cultured in Hank's balanced salt solution  HBSS). HMGB1 expression in Lewis cells increased and the protein was shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and was secreted  coincident with up-regulation of autophagy. Prevention of HMGB1 binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) or knock-down of HMGB1 expression led to inhibition of autophagy and increased apoptosis. These results demonstrated a positive feedback pathway whereby starvation of Lewis cells promoted HMGB1 secretion  allowing cells to survive by regulating autophagy via a RAGE-HMGB1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2-dependent pathway. These results also implicate HMGB1 as a potential risk factor for cancer growth and metastasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy as an antimicrobial strategy.Autophagy is a process of lysosomal degradation that was originally described as a cellular response to adapt to a lack of nutrients and to enable the elimination of damaged organelles. Autophagy is increasingly recognized as a process that is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens. Studies on the regulation of autophagy have uncovered components of the autophagic cascade that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Approaches to modulate autophagy may result in novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of various infections.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Neurodegenerative disease and autophagy].In neurodegenerative diseases  accumulation of aggregated proteins leads to inclusion body formation which is the hallmark of the pathological findings. Formation of inclusion bodies is now thought to be a cellular protective mechanism to collect aggregated proteins to a small compartment in the cell since more oligomeric form of aggregated proteins seem to have more toxicity than highly polymeric aggregates which are present in the inclusion bodies. The experimental inclusion body called aggresome is formed at microtubule organizing center by the help of microtubules and motor protein complex upon proteasome inhibition. Recently  the author reported that the collection of aggregated proteins to aggresome is closely related to their degradation by autophagy-lysosomal degradation system which strongly suggested that autophagy is a back-up system for ubiquitin proteasomal protein degradation system. Thus to find ways to upregulate protein degradation system including ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy for therapeutic point of view is a quite promising strategy.,Autophagy_notLIR
α-Synuclein and protein degradation systems: a reciprocal relationship.An increasing wealth of data indicates a close relationship between the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Alpha-synuclein protein levels are considered as a major determinant of its neurotoxic potential  whereas secreted extracellular alpha-synuclein has emerged as an additional important factor in this regard. However  the manner of alpha-synuclein degradation in neurons remains contentious. Both the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP)-mainly macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy-have been suggested to contribute to alpha-synuclein turnover. Additionally  other proteases such as calpains  neurosin  and metalloproteinases have been also proposed to have a role in intracellular and extracellular alpha-synuclein processing. Both UPS and ALP activity decline with aging and such decline may play a pivotal role in many neurodegenerative conditions. Alterations in these major proteolytic pathways may result in alpha-synuclein accumulation due to impaired clearance. Conversely  increased alpha-synuclein protein burden promotes the generation of aberrant species that may impair further UPS or ALP function  generating thus a bidirectional positive feedback loop leading to neuronal death. In the current review  we summarize the recent findings related to alpha-synuclein degradation  as well as to alpha-synuclein-mediated aberrant effects on protein degradation systems. Identifying the factors that regulate alpha-synuclein association to cellular proteolytic pathways may represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions in PD and related synucleinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Caloric restriction mimetic 2-deoxyglucose antagonizes doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte death by multiple mechanisms.Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention known to enhance cardiovascular health. The glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) mimics CR effects in several animal models. However  whether 2-DG is beneficial to the heart remains obscure. Here  we tested the ability of 2-DG to reduce cardiomyocyte death triggered by doxorubicin (DOX  1 μm)  an antitumor drug that can cause heart failure. Treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with 0.5 mm 2-DG dramatically suppressed DOX cytotoxicity as indicated by a decreased number of cells that stained positive for propidium iodide and reduced apoptotic markers. 2-DG decreased intracellular ATP levels by 17.9%  but it prevented DOX-induced severe depletion of ATP  which may contribute to 2-DG-mediated cytoprotection. Also  2-DG increased the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Blocking AMPK signaling with compound C or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the catalytic subunit markedly attenuated the protective effects of 2-DG. Conversely  AMPK activation by pharmacological or genetic approach reduced DOX cardiotoxicity but did not produce additive effects when used together with 2-DG. In addition  2-DG induced autophagy  a cellular degradation pathway whose activation could be either protective or detrimental depending on the context. Paradoxically  despite its ability to activate autophagy  2-DG prevented DOX-induced detrimental autophagy. Together  these results suggest that the CR mimetic 2-DG can antagonize DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death  which is mediated through multiple mechanisms  including the preservation of ATP content  the activation of AMPK  and the inhibition of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Reviving an old HIV-1 gene: the HIV-1 antisense protein.The existence of an HIV-1 protein translated from an antisense transcript was suggested over 25 years ago. However  this Antisense Protein (ASP) gene has still not been completely accepted by the HIV-1 research community. The aim of this review is to discuss recent findings  which suggest that ASP needs to be considered as a viral gene  playing an important role in HIV-1 replication and persistence. In past years  several studies have highlighted the existence of HIV-1 antisense transcripts. More recently  we and others have convincingly demonstrated that this transcript produces a protein with a unique distribution and a rapid turnover  when expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore  a role in autophagy and HIV-1 replication has been associated with this protein. In light of these recent reports  we believe that ASP needs to be added to the schematic representation of the HIV-1 proviral DNA and requires further investigation  as it could represent a new potential target for anti-retroviral therapies and vaccine strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of autophagy in sensitizing malignant glioma cells to radiation therapy.Malignant gliomas represent the majority of primary brain tumors. The current standard treatments for malignant gliomas include surgical resection  radiation therapy  and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy  a standard adjuvant therapy  confers some survival advantages  but resistance of the glioma cells to the efficacy of radiation limits the success of the treatment. The mechanisms underlying glioma cell radioresistance have remained elusive. Autophagy is a protein degradation system characterized by a prominent formation of double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm. Recent studies suggest that autophagy may be important in the regulation of cancer development and progression and in determining the response of tumor cells to anticancer therapy. Also  autophagy is a novel response of glioma cells to ionizing radiation. Autophagic cell death is considered programmed cell death type II  whereas apoptosis is programmed cell death type I. These two types of cell death are predominantly distinctive  but many studies demonstrate a cross-talk between them. Whether autophagy in cancer cells causes death or protects cells is controversial. The regulatory pathways of autophagy share several molecules. PI3K/Akt/mTOR  DNA-PK  tumor suppressor genes  mitochondrial damage  and lysosome may play important roles in radiation-induced autophagy in glioma cells. Recently  a highly tumorigenic glioma tumor subpopulation  termed cancer stem cell or tumor-initiating cell  has been shown to promote therapeutic resistance.

Our novel generated Aza-podophyllotoxin compounds (AZP 8a & AZP 9a) are analogues of podophyllotoxin and were previously screened for anti-cancer activity through the NCI 60 cell line screening panel showing activity on various cell types including colon cancer. This study expands the toxicological screening by studying apoptosis and various hallmark events as part of the mechanism of action of these compounds on colon cancer cells. The COLO 205 cell line was selected and exposed to AZP to determine the IC50 doses at 24 hours treatment. Apoptosis hallmark events such as migration of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the cell membrane  DNA fragmentation  cell cycle effects  mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation were included. Experiments were performed in triplicates for all tested compounds including AZP 8a  AZP 9a  camptothecin as positive control and vehicle as negative control. Our results present contrasting apoptotic activity between the experimental compounds. Compound 8a presented migration of PS (annexin V assay)  DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest at S phase. Compound 9a presented PS migration with fragmented DNA  cell cycle arrest at S phase  mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and activation of caspase 3  8 and 9. Compound 8a without the oxygen atoms in ring A appears to cause effects similarly to autophagy as induced by etoposide  a cancer drug analogue of our heterocyclic compounds. Compound 9a with the oxygen atoms in expanded ring A presented induction of cell death following activation of a classical apoptosis pathway. Our results suggest that minor structural differences among these AZP can account for the difference in biological response and cancer cell toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Contributions of metabolic dysregulation and inflammation to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  hepatic fibrosis  and cancer.We review accumulating evidence that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  a more advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  predisposes patients to the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  and we summarize recent advances in the elucidation of cancer-promoting pathways in NASH. We highlight the potential role of progenitor cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in promoting the early events that could culminate in cancer  as well as the emerging contribution of the gut-liver axis in promoting inflammation  senescence  and tumor growth in NASH and HCC. Finally  we review the role of bile acid receptors  vitamin D  and protective cellular pathways such as autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The mammalian target of rapamycin pathway as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is centrally located  linking proximal oncogenic cascades to critical downstream pathways that drive tumor growth. mTOR regulates such diverse functions as protein translation  proliferation  viability  autophagy  metabolism homeostasis  monitoring of energy reserves  and induction of angiogenesis. Given its fundamental role in tumorigenesis  it is not surprising that a huge effort is being made to develop mTOR inhibitors. The existence of feedback pathways that become activated subsequent to mTOR inhibition has complicated these efforts. However  the fact that mTOR exists in two separate complexes  TORC1 and TORC2  and rapalogs primarily inhibit only TORC1 and TORC2 is actually a key activator of AKT  has injected new energy into the quest to find inhibitors that can inhibit both complexes. In myeloma models  preclinical studies confirm the activity of rapalogs as well as newer TORC1/TORC2 inhibitors  and early phase clinical trials have begun. In addition  the recent finding of up-regulated myeloma cell expression of DEPTOR  an mTOR binding protein that restricts mTOR activity  suggests an additional future therapeutic target specific to the myeloma tumor model.,Autophagy_notLIR
Harnessing chaperone-mediated autophagy for the selective degradation of mutant huntingtin protein.Huntington's Disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited pathology caused by the accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein (HTT) containing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. As the polyglutamine binding peptide 1 (QBP1) is known to bind an expanded polyQ tract but not the polyQ motif found in normal HTT  we selectively targeted mutant HTT for degradation by expressing a fusion molecule comprising two copies of QBP1 and copies of two different heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70)-binding motifs in cellular and mouse models of HD. Chaperone-mediated autophagy contributed to the specific degradation of mutant HTT in cultured cells expressing the construct. Intrastriatal delivery of a virus expressing the fusion molecule ameliorated the disease phenotype in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Similar adaptor molecules comprising HSC70-binding motifs fused to an appropriate structure-specific binding agent(s) may have therapeutic potential for treating diseases caused by misfolded proteins other than those with expanded polyQ tracts.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identifying protein partners of CLN8  an ER-resident protein involved in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cognitive and motor decline  epilepsy  visual loss and by lysosomal autofluorescent inclusions. Two distinct clinical phenotypes  the progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR) and a late-infantile variant of NCLs (CLN8-vLINCL) are associated with mutations in the CLN8 gene that encodes a transmembrane protein predominantly located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To gain insight into the function of CLN8 protein  we employed the split-ubiquitin membrane-based yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system  which detects protein-protein interactions in a membrane environment  using the full-length human CLN8 as bait and a human brain cDNA library as prey. We identified several potential protein partners of CLN8 and especially referred to VAPA  c14orf1/hERG28  STX8  GATE16  BNIP3 and BNIP3L proteins that are associated with biologically relevant processes such as synthesis and transport of lipids  vesicular/membrane trafficking  autophagy/mitophagy and apoptosis. Interactions of CLN8 with VAPA and GATE16 were further validated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays in mammalian cells. Using a new C-terminal-oriented CLN8 antibody  CLN8-VAPA interaction was also confirmed by co-staining in close spatial proximity within different CNS tissues. The results of this study shed light on potential interactome networks of CLN8 and provide a powerful starting point for understanding protein function(s) and molecular aspects of diseases associated with CLN8 deficiency.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Aging and autophagy].Autophagy  a major intracellular degradation system which is conserved from yeast to mammals  is essential for the cellular clearance and the maintenance of homeostasis inside the cell. The autophagic activity is reported to decrease in almost all cells and tissues following aging  and genetic inhibition of autophagy in mice leads to degenerative changes and diseases that are highly associated with aging. On the other hand  various intervention strategies that delay senescence or increase life span in model organisms often stimulate autophagy  and autophagy inhibition compromises these anti-aging effects. Here  we review recent evidences in support of tight connections between autophagy and aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nilotinib induces autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma through AMPK activation.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and the third-leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Nilotinib is an orally available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia. This study investigated the effect of nilotinib on HCC. Nilotinib did not induce cellular apoptosis. Instead  staining with acridine orange and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 revealed that nilotinib induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC cell lines  including PLC5  Huh-7  and Hep3B. Moreover  nilotinib up-regulated the phosphryaltion of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and protein phosphatase PP2A inactivation were detected after nilotinib treatment. Up-regulating PP2A activity suppressed nilotinib-induced AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy  suggesting that PP2A mediates the effect of nilotinib on AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy. Our data indicate that nilotinib-induced AMPK activation is mediated by PP2A  and AMPK activation and subsequent autophagy might be a major mechanism of action of nilotinib. Growth of PLC5 tumor xenografts in BALB/c nude mice was inhibited by daily oral treatment with nilotinib. Western blot analysis showed both increased phospho-AMPK expression and decreased PP2A activity in vivo. Together  our results reveal that nilotinib induces autophagy  but not apoptosis in HCC  and that the autophagy-inducing activity is associated with PP2A-regulated AMPK phosphorylation.,Autophagy_notLIR
STAT3 Decoy Oligodeoxynucleotides-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles Induce Cell Death and Inhibit Invasion in Ovarian Cancer Cells.Recent advances in the synthesis of multi-functional nanoparticles have opened up tremendous opportunities for the targeted delivery of genes of interest. Cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) can efficiently bind nucleic acid molecules and transfect genes in vitro. Few reports have combined SLN with therapy using decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). In the present study  we prepared SLN to encapsulate STAT3 decoy ODN; then  the properties and in vitro behavior of SLN-STAT3 decoy ODN complexes were investigated. SLN-STAT3 decoy ODN complexes were efficiently taken up by human ovarian cancer cells and significantly suppressed cell growth. Blockage of the STAT3 pathway by SLN-STAT3 decoy ODN complexes resulted in an evident induction of cell death  including apoptotic and autophagic death. The mechanism involved the increased expression of cleaved caspase 3  Bax  Beclin-1 and LC3-II and reduced expression of Bcl-2  pro-caspase 3  Survivin  p-Akt and p-mTOR. In addition  SLN-STAT3 decoy ODN complexes inhibited cell invasion by up-regulating E-cadherin expression and down-regulating Snail and MMP-9 expression. These findings confirmed that SLN as STAT3 decoy ODN carriers can induce cell death and inhibit invasion of ovarian cancer cells. We propose that SLN represent a potential approach for targeted gene delivery in cancer therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy in nuclear receptor PPARgamma-deficient mouse prostatic carcinogenesis.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a major modulator of cellular lipid metabolism and organelle differentiation. To understand whether autophagy is involved in the processes of dysregulated fatty acid oxidation and induced oxidative stress accompanying prostatic carcinogenesis  we characterized in vitro and in vivo models of PPARgamma- and PPARgamma2-deficiency in mouse prostate epithelia. Autophagy accompanied the altered cellular proliferation and de-differentiation that resulted in PPARgamma-/gamma2-deficient mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). Electron microscopy showed accumulated defective lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles in PPARgamma-/gamma2-deficient cells  suggestive of autophagy. Gene expression profiling indicated a major dysregulation of cell cycle control and metabolic signaling networks related to peroxisomal  mitochondrial and lysosomal maturation  lipid oxidation and degradation. Further  the putative autophagic phenotypes of PPARgamma-null cells could be rescued by re-expression of either the PPARgamma1 or -gamma2 isoform. Our paper examines the links between autophagy and PPARgamma-related subcellular and histopathological changes taking place during murine prostatic carcinogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2-N and sequestosome-1 (p62) are components of the ubiquitination process mediated by the malin-laforin E3-ubiquitin ligase complex.Lafora disease (LD  OMIM254780  ORPHA501) is a rare neurodegenerative form of epilepsy related to mutations in two proteins: laforin  a dual specificity phosphatase  and malin  an E3-ubiquitin ligase. Both proteins form a functional complex  where laforin recruits specific substrates to be ubiquitinated by malin. However  little is known about the mechanism driving malin-laforin mediated ubiquitination of its substrates. In this work we present evidence indicating that the malin-laforin complex interacts physically and functionally with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2-N (UBE2N). This binding determines the topology of the chains that the complex is able to promote in the corresponding substrates (mainly K63-linked polyubiquitin chains). In addition  we demonstrate that the malin-laforin complex interacts with the selective autophagy adaptor sequestosome-1 (p62). Binding of p62 to the malin-laforin complex allows its recognition by LC3  a component of the autophagosomal membrane. In addition  p62 enhances the ubiquitinating activity of the malin-laforin E3-ubiquitin ligase complex. These data enrich our knowledge on the mechanism of action of the malin-laforin complex as an E3-ubiquitin ligase and reinforces the role of this complex in targeting substrates toward the autophagy pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
The expression of podocyte-specific proteins in parietal epithelial cells is regulated by protein degradation.The role of parietal epithelial cells (PECs) in glomerular disease is unclear because they also express podocyte proteins under pathophysiological conditions. To help resolve this  we established a novel PEC isolation technique in rats and mice to investigate which regulatory mechanisms lead to podocyte protein expression in PECs. This pure pool of naive PECs was then compared with PECs in primary culture and immortalized PECs in permanent culture. The naive PECs expressed low levels of podocyte-specific mRNA. Accordingly  in crescentic glomerulonephritis  single PECs activated the podocin promoter in vivo. In primary culture  PECs expressed a distinct morphology from podocytes but with high transcript and protein levels of PEC markers. In contrast to naive PECs  cultured PECs also expressed podocyte proteins  and this correlated with reduced proteolytic activity but not with increased transcript levels. Activation of autophagy or proteasomal degradation decreased the levels of podocyte proteins in PECs  whereas inhibition of proteasomal degradation led to the stabilization of podocyte proteins in PECs. Thus  naive PECs express podocyte transcripts physiologically and these podocyte proteins are stable under pathological conditions through decreased proteolysis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Influence of cell volume changes on autophagic proteolysis in the perfused liver of air-breathing walking catfish (Clarias batrachus).Exposure of perfused liver of walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) to hypotonicity (-80 mOsmol/L) caused swelling of liver cells as evidenced by the increase in liver mass by 11.5%  and inhibition of [(3)H]leucine release (as a measure of proteolysis) by 37% from the radiolabeled perfused liver. Whereas  exposure of perfused liver to hypertonicity (+80 mOsmol/L) caused shrinkage of liver cells as evidenced by the decrease in liver mass by 10.4%  and stimulation of [(3)H]leucine release by 24%. Infusion of amino acids such as glutamine plus glycine (2 mM each) also caused increase in liver cell volume as evidenced by the increase in liver mass by 8.9%  and inhibition of [(3)H]leucine release by 29%. Adjustment of anisotonicity of the media without changing the NaCl concentration in the media had almost similar effects on proteolysis in the perfused liver. A direct correlation of cell volume changes or hydration status of liver cells with that of proteolysis was observed in the perfused liver regardless of whether the cell volume increase/decrease was evoked by anisotonic perfusion media or by the addition of amino acids. Thus  it appears that the increase/decrease in hepatic cell volume could be one of the important modulators for adjusting the autophagic proteolysis in walking catfish probably to avoid the adverse affects of osmotically induced cell volume changes  to preserve the hepatic cell function and for proper energy supply under osmotic stress. This is the first report of cell volume-sensitive changes of autophagic proteolysis in hepatic cells of any teleosts.,Autophagy_notLIR
The polynuclear platinum BBR3610 induces G2/M arrest and autophagy early and apoptosis late in glioma cells.BBR3610 is a polynuclear platinum compound  in which two platinums are linked by a spermine-like linker  and studies in a variety of cancers  including glioma  have shown that it is more potent than conventional platinums and works by different means. Identifying the mechanism of action of BBR3610 would help in developing the drug further for clinical use. Previous work showed that BBR3610 does not induce immediate apoptosis but results in an early G2/M arrest. Here  we report that BBR3610 induces early autophagy in glioma cells. Increased autophagy was also seen in intracranial xenografts treated with BBR3610. Interestingly  upon attenuation of autophagy by RNAi-mediated knockdown of ATG5 or ATG6/BECN1  no change in cell viability was observed  suggesting that the autophagy is neither an effective protection against BBR3610 nor an important part of the mechanism by which BBR3610 reduces glioma cell viability. This prompted a multimodal analysis of 4 cell lines over 2 weeks posttreatment with BBR3610  which showed that the G2/M arrest occurred early and apoptosis occurred later in all cell lines. The cells that survived entered a senescent state associated with mitotic catastrophe in 2 of the cell lines. Together  our data show that the response to treatment with a single agent is complex and changes over time.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mutant protein kinase C gamma that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is selectively degraded by autophagy.Several causal missense mutations in the protein kinase Cgamma (gammaPKC) gene have been found in spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14)  an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. We previously showed that mutant gammaPKC found in SCA14 is susceptible to aggregation and causes apoptosis. Aggregation of misfolded proteins is generally involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence indicates that macroautophagy (autophagy) is important for the degradation of misfolded proteins and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study  we examined whether autophagy is involved in the degradation of the mutant gammaPKC that causes SCA14. Mutant gammaPKC-GFP was transiently expressed in SH-SY5Y cells by using an adenoviral tetracycline-regulated system. Subsequently  temporal changes in clearance of aggregates and degradation of gammaPKC-GFP were evaluated. Rapamycin  an autophagic inducer  accelerated clearance of aggregates and promoted degradation of mutant gammaPKC-GFP  but it did not affect degradation of wild-type gammaPKC-GFP. These effects of rapamycin were not observed in embryonic fibroblast cells from Atg5-deficient mice  which are not able to perform autophagy. Furthermore  lithium  another type of autophagic inducer  also promoted the clearance of mutant gammaPKC aggregates. These results indicate that autophagy contributes to the degradation of mutant gammaPKC  suggesting that autophagic inducers could provide therapeutic potential for SCA14.,Autophagy_notLIR
Paxilitaxel induces apoptosis accompanied by protective autophagy in osteosarcoma cells through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α pathway.Paxilitaxel  a drug used in cancer chemoprevention and treatment  has shown promising anti‑cancer effects against a broad spectrum of tumors. However  the effect of paxilitaxel on osteoblasts has remained to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti‑tumor effect of paxilitaxel on human osteosarcoma cancer cells  the underlying molecular mechanism as well as drug resistance involved. The results showed that paxilitaxel not only induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway but also induced autophagy  which partially inhibited cell apoptosis. The present study also demonstrated that paxilitaxel induced autophagy through the hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF)‑1α pathway. Moreover  paxilitaxel‑induced apoptosis decreased following incubation with with the autophagy inducer rapamycin. By contrast  co‑treatment with the HIF‑1α inhibitor YC‑1 or autophagy inhibitor 3‑methyladenine significantly blocked autophagy and augmented the anti‑tumor effects of paxilitaxel. Therefore  the results of the present study suggested that the combination of paxilitaxel with an autophagy inhibitor or a HIF‑1α inhibitor may be an effective and potent strategy for improved chemotherapy of osteosarcoma in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and lysosomes in Pompe disease.In Pompe disease  a deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase  intralysosomal glycogen accumulates in multiple tissues  with skeletal and cardiac muscle most severely affected.(1) Complete enzyme deficiency results in rapidly progressive infantile cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle myopathy that is fatal within the first two years of life. Patients with partial enzyme deficiency suffer from skeletal muscle myopathy and experience shortened lifespan due to respiratory failure. The major advance has been the development of enzyme replacement therapy  which recently became available for Pompe patients. However  the effective clearance of skeletal muscle glycogen  as shown by both clinical and preclinical studies  has proven more difficult than anticipated.(2-4) Our recent work published in Annals of Neurology(5) was designed to cast light on the problem  and was an attempt to look beyond the lysosomes by analyzing the downstream events affected by the accumulation of undigested substrate in lysosomes. We have found that the cellular pathology in Pompe disease spreads to affect both endocytic (the route of the therapeutic enzyme) and autophagic (the route of glycogen) pathways  leading to excessive autophagic buildup in therapy-resistant skeletal muscle fibers of the knockout mice.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Salih ataxia mutation impairs Rubicon endosomal localization.We previously described a new form of recessive ataxia  Salih ataxia  in a large consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with three affected children carrying a new identified mutation in the KIAA0226 gene (c.2624delC; p.Ala875ValfsX146) coding for Rubicon. The pathogenicity of such mutation remains to be identified. Hence  we address the cellular impact of Rubicon p.Ala875ValfsX146 on endosomal/lysosomal machinery on cultured cells. We confirm that Rubicon colocalizes with the late endosome marker Rab7 and demonstrate that it also colocalizes with LampI at lysosomes. The Salih ataxia mutation leads to a diffuse cytosolic distribution and mislocalized protein from the late endosomes  indicating that deletion of the diacylglycerol binding-like motif in the mutant protein interferes with normal Rubicon subcellular localization and confirming the pathogenicity of the mutation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Size  stoichiometry  and organization of soluble LC3-associated complexes.MAP1LC3B  an ortholog of yeast Atg8 and a member of the family of proteins formerly also known as ATG8 in mammals (LC3B henceforth in the text)  functions in autophagosome formation and autophagy substrate recruitment. LC3 exists in both a soluble (autophagosome-independent) form as well as a lipid modified form that becomes tightly incorporated into autophagosomal membranes. Although LC3 is known to associate with tens of proteins  relatively little is known about soluble LC3 aside from its interactions with the LC3 lipid conjugation machinery. In previous studies we found autophagosome-independent GFP-LC3B diffuses unusually slowly for a protein of its size  suggesting it may constitutively associate with a high molecular weight complex  form homo-oligomers or aggregates  or reversibly bind microtubules or membranes. To distinguish between these possibilities  we characterized the size  stoichiometry  and organization of autophagosome-independent LC3B in living cells and in cytoplasmic extracts using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence polarization fluctuation analysis (FPFA). We found that the diffusion of LC3B was unaffected by either mutational disruption of its lipid modification or microtubule depolymerization. Brightness and homo-FRET analysis indicate LC3B does not homo-oligomerize. However  mutation of specific residues on LC3B required for binding other proteins and mRNA altered the effective hydrodynamic radius of the protein as well as its stoichiometry. We conclude that when not bound to autophagosomes  LC3B associates with a multicomponent complex with an effective size of ~500 kDa in the cytoplasm. These findings provide new insights into the nature of soluble LC3B and illustrate the power of FRAP and FPFA to investigate the emergent properties of protein complexes in the autophagy pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ellipticine-induced apoptosis depends on Akt translocation and signaling in lung epithelial cancer cells.Ellipticine and its analogues were reported as topoisomerase II inhibitors and promising antitumor agents. In this work  we showed that the growth of human non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) epithelial cells A549 can be inhibited by ellipticine. The inhibitory effect was reverted by PI3K inhibitors. The sub-G(1) phase cells after ellipticine treatment appeared at the expense of those that accumulated first at S- and G(2)/M phases during the early stage of treatment. We showed that the progression leading to cell death was impaired by wortmannin  which reverted apoptosis by retaining cells at S- and G(2)/M transition states. The characteristic apoptosis marker p53 activation after treatment appeared first followed by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) fragmentation. They disappeared upon co-treatment with wortmannin and the apoptotic phenotype reversed. Furthermore  ellipticine regulated endogenous survival signaling by up-regulating phosphorylated Akt that returned to its basal level later. Furthermore  ellipticine induced nucleus translocalization of p53 and Akt and recruitment of autophagosomes. The autophagic-related cell death was interfered by wortmannin and the suppressed growth reverted. The Akt-related cell death also occurred in p53-deficient cells with stable expression of exogenous p53. The work showed that ellipticine-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was achieved through autophagy and apoptotic death as a result of Akt-modulation. Being a topoisomerase II inhibitor  ellipticine proved a regulator in autophagy-related cell death through corporation of p53 and Akt.,Autophagy_notLIR
The use of induced pluripotent stem cells to reveal pathogenic gene mutations and explore treatments for retinitis pigmentosa.Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited human retinal disorder that causes progressive photoreceptor cell loss  leading to severe vision impairment or blindness.

Although genetic mutations have been identified  the available clinical data are not always sufficient to elucidate the roles of these mutations in disease pathogenesis  a situation that is partially due to differences in genetic backgrounds.,Autophagy_notLIR
Reactive oxygen species mediate Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis through PI3K/AKT-dependent activation of GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling.Cr(VI) compounds are known human carcinogens that primarily target the lungs. Cr(VI) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS)  but the exact effects of ROS on the signaling molecules involved in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis have not been extensively studied. Chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to Cr(VI) at nanomolar concentrations (10-100nM) for 3months not only induced cell transformation  but also increased the potential of these cells to invade and migrate. Injection of Cr(VI)-stimulated cells into nude mice resulted in the formation of tumors. Chronic exposure to Cr(VI) increased levels of intracellular ROS and antiapoptotic proteins. Transfection with catalase or superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented Cr(VI)-mediated increases in colony formation  cell invasion  migration  and xenograft tumors. While chronic Cr(VI) exposure led to activation of signaling cascades involving PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/mTOR  transfection with catalase or SOD markedly inhibited Cr(VI)-mediated activation of these signaling proteins. Inhibitors specific for AKT or β-catenin almost completely suppressed the Cr(VI)-mediated increase in total and active β-catenin proteins and colony formation. In particular  Cr(VI) suppressed autophagy of epithelial cells under nutrition deprivation. Furthermore  there was a marked induction of AKT  GSK-3β  β-catenin  mTOR  and carcinogenic markers in tumor tissues formed in mice after injection with Cr(VI)-stimulated cells. Collectively  our findings suggest that ROS is a key mediator of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis through the activation of PI3K/AKT-dependent GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling and the promotion of cell survival mechanisms via the inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
GOLGA2/GM130  cis-Golgi matrix protein  is a novel target of anticancer gene therapy.Achievement of long-term survival of patients with lung cancer treated with conventional chemotherapy is still difficult for treatment of metastatic and advanced tumors. Despite recent progress in investigational therapies  survival rates are still disappointingly low and novel adjuvant and systemic therapies are urgently needed. A recently elucidated secretory pathway is attracting considerable interest as a promising anticancer target. The cis-Golgi matrix protein  GOLGA2/GM130  plays an important role in glycosylation and transport of protein in the secretory pathway. In this study  the effects of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting GOLGA2/GM130 (shGOLGA2) on autophagy and lung cancer growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of GOLGA2/GM130 led to induction of autophagy and inhibition of glycosylation in A549 cells and in the lungs of K-ras(LA1) mice. Furthermore  downregulation of GOLGA2/GM130 decreased angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion in vitro and suppressed tumorigenesis in lung cancer mice model. The tumor specificity of sequence targeting GOLGA2/GM130 was also demonstrated. Taken together  these results suggest that induction of autophagy by shGOLGA2 may induce cell death rather than cell survival. Therefore  downregulation of GOLGA2/GM130 may be a potential therapeutic option for lung cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
A novel manganese complex LMnAc selectively kills cancer cells by induction of ROS-triggered and mitochondrial-mediated cell death.We previously identified a novel synthesized metal compound  LMnAc ([L2Mn2(Ac)(H2O)2](Ac) (L=bis(2-pyridylmethyl) amino-2-propionic acid)). This compound exhibited significant inhibition on cancer cell proliferation and was more selective against cancer cells than was the popular chemotherapeutic reagent cisplatin. In this study  we further investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of LMnAc-induced cancer cell death. We found that LMnAc achieved its selectivity against cancer cells through the transferrin-transferrin receptor system  which is highly expressed in tumor cells. LMnAc triggered cancer cells to commit autophagy and apoptosis  which was mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. Moreover  LMnAc disrupted mitochondrial function  resulting in mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and ATP reduction. In addition  LMnAc induced intracellular Ca(2+) overload and reactive oxygen species generation. Interestingly  its anticancer effect was significantly reduced following pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine  indicating that reactive oxygen species triggered cell death. Altogether  our data suggest that LMnAc appears to be a selectively promising anticancer drug candidate.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activation by Alda-1 inhibits atherosclerosis and attenuates hepatic steatosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice.Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)  an enzyme responsible for the detoxification of reactive aldehydes  is considered to exert protective function in mitochondria. We investigated the influence of Alda-1  an activator of ALDH2  on atherogenesis and on the liver steatosis in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice.,Autophagy_notLIR
Exacerbation of ischemia-induced amyloid-beta generation by diabetes is associated with autophagy activation in mice brain.To evaluate effect of diabetes on transient ischemia-induced brain damage and autophagy activity  streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mellitus (DM) mice were subjected to transient common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) operation. After the operation  immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (EM) were performed to investigate the astrocytes activation  amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) expression and accumulation of autophagy-like vacuoles containing electron-dense material (avd); and hallmarks of autophagy  the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II  was detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that DM amplified stroke-induced astrocytes activation and Abeta generation. Western blot analysis showed that LC3-II conjugate was drastically up-regulated at early stages post ischemia and it last for at least 72h in DM mice brain. DM mice demonstrated increased baseline level of LC3-II as comparing to normal mice; DM also amplified stroke-induced LC3-II level. Under EM  avd was most markedly accumulated in neurons of DM mice brain after ischemia. Immunofluorescence double-staining showed that most Abeta and autophagosomes co-localized. Therefore  our results suggested that exacerbation of ischemia-induced Abeta generation by diabetes might be associated with autophagy activation in mice brain  and modulating neuronal autophagy might be a new therapeutic strategy to depress the risk of development of dementia in diabetic patients with stroke.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of damage-regulated autophagy modulator-1 (DRAM-1) impairs neutrophil differentiation of NB4 APL cells.The damage-regulator autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM-1) is a lysosomal protein that positively regulates autophagy in a p53-dependent manner. We aimed at analyzing the role of DRAM-1 in granulocytic differentiation of APL cells. We observed a significant increase of DRAM-1 expression during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced neutrophil differentiation of NB4 APL cells but not in ATRA-resistant NB4-R2 cells. Next  knocking down DRAM-1 in NB4 APL cells was sufficient to impair neutrophil differentiation. Given that DRAM-1 is a transcriptional target of p53  we tested if DRAM-1 is regulated by the p53 relative p73. Indeed  inhibiting p73 prevented neutrophil differentiation and DRAM-1 induction of NB4 cells. In conclusion  we show for the first time that p73-regulated DRAM-1 is functionally involved in neutrophil differentiation of APL cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Defective IL-1A expression in patients with Crohn's disease is related to attenuated MAP3K4 signaling.Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an aberrant immune response to bacterial products stimulating TLR  in genetically susceptible hosts. Next to mutations in the TLR signaling molecule NOD2  several other immune response- and autophagy-genes contribute to CD. Since only 10-20% of cases can be explained by a NOD2 defect  we searched for additional TLR-related disease-causing factors. We analyzed the LPS response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 23 CD patients in remission  compared to 16 controls in a time course experiment. Individuals with any of the three major contributing NOD2 mutations were excluded. Overall  the LPS-responsive gene transcript levels  determined by low density arrays  were significantly lower in CD patients. In particular IL-1A expression was severely reduced in CD patients (ninefold reduction  p=0.001). Quantification of several important TLR4 signal transducers and cytokines identified MAP3K4 as a candidate signaling molecule with reduced expression in CD patients  which might explain the low IL-1A expression. Silencing of MAP3K4 by lentiviral shRNA transduction indeed showed that the expression of IL-1A was specifically dependent on this kinase. Furthermore  the expression of GSK3β  an inhibitor of MAP3K4  was increased in CD patients. In conclusion  we identified a novel TLR signaling defect in CD patients involving MAP3K4 and IL-1A. This confirms the hypothesis that CD patients  despite their massive intestinal inflammation  suffer from a relative immune deficiency in TLR-mediated cytokine production.,Autophagy_notLIR
Melamine Alters Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission of CA3-CA1 Synapses Presynaptically Through Autophagy Activation in the Rat Hippocampus.Melamine is an industrial chemical that can cause central nervous system disorders including excitotoxicity and cognitive impairment. Its illegal use in powdered baby formula was the focus of a milk scandal in China in 2008. One of our previous studies showed that melamine impaired glutamatergic transmission in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. However  the underlying mechanism of action of melamine is unclear  and it is unknown if the CA3-CA1 pathway is directly involved. In the present study  a whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed to investigate the effect of melamine on the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway in vitro. Both the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) were recorded. Furthermore  we examined whether autophagy was involved in glutamatergic transmission alterations induced by melamine. Our data showed that melamine significantly increased the amplitude of eEPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor did not prevent the increase in eEPSC amplitude. In addition  the PPR was remarkably decreased by a melamine concentration of 5 × 10(-5) g/mL. It was found that autophagy could be activated by melamine and an autophagy inhibitor  3-MA  prevented the melamine-induced increase in eEPSC amplitude. Overall  our results show that melamine presynaptically alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in vitro and this is likely associated with autophagy alteration.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanisms of growth plate maturation and epiphyseal fusion.Longitudinal growth occurs within the long bones at the growth plate. During childhood  the growth plate matures  its total width decreases and eventually it disappears at the end of puberty with complete replacement by bone along with cessation of longitudinal growth. The exact mechanism of epiphyseal fusion is still not completely understood and experimental studies are complicated by the fact that there is a species difference between humans and rabbits that do fuse their growth plates and rodents that do not. This mini review summarizes hypotheses and theories postulated in the literature regarding growth plate maturation and epiphyseal fusion. Growth factors  local regulators and hormones involved in growth plate maturation are described as well as four postulated hypotheses and theories regarding the final steps in epiphyseal fusion: apoptosis  autophagy  transdifferentiation and hypoxia. A better insight into the mechanisms of epiphyseal fusion may ultimately help to develop new strategies for the treatment of cartilage and growth disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mevalonate Pathway Blockade  Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Autophagy: A Possible Link.The mevalonate pathway  crucial for cholesterol synthesis  plays a key role in multiple cellular processes. Deregulation of this pathway is also correlated with diminished protein prenylation  an important post-translational modification necessary to localize certain proteins  such as small GTPases  to membranes. Mevalonate pathway blockade has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction: especially involving lower mitochondrial membrane potential and increased release of pro-apoptotic factors in cytosol. Furthermore a severe reduction of protein prenylation has also been associated with defective autophagy  possibly causing inflammasome activation and subsequent cell death. So  it is tempting to hypothesize a mechanism in which defective autophagy fails to remove damaged mitochondria  resulting in increased cell death. This mechanism could play a significant role in Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency  an autoinflammatory disease characterized by a defect in Mevalonate Kinase  a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Patients carrying mutations in the MVK gene  encoding this enzyme  show increased inflammation and lower protein prenylation levels. This review aims at analysing the correlation between mevalonate pathway defects  mitochondrial dysfunction and defective autophagy  as well as inflammation  using Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency as a model to clarify the current pathogenetic hypothesis as the basis of the disease.,Autophagy_notLIR

Cytotoxicity of fipronil on mice liver cells.In the present study  mice livers were examined following exposure to different doses of fipronil (15  25  and 50 mg/kg). Histological and histochemical techniques were used to determine the cytotoxic potential of this compound and to assess the damage it caused to livers. Mice were divided into four groups: control group and groups I  II  and III were exposed to 15  25  and 50 mg/kg fipronil  respectively. Our findings revealed cytological  morphohistological  and histochemical alterations in liver cells of animals from groups I  II  and III compared to group control animals. These changes included Kupffer-cell proliferation  hepatocyte hypertrophy  accumulation and distribution of proteins  polysaccharides  lipids  and vacuoles in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes  and congestion of blood vessels. These phenotypes mainly characterize the following: (a) autophagic processes  (b) steatosis  and (c) cell death by necrosis  which demonstrate the damage caused by fipronil on nontarget organisms in artificial conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical characterization of autophagic vacuoles in isolated hepatocytes: effects of vinblastine and asparagine on vacuole distributions.The interactions between the autophagic and the endocytic degradation pathways were investigated by means of immunogold labeling of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in ultrathin frozen sections from isolated rat hepatocytes. AVs were identified by their autophagocytosed contents of the degradation-resistant cytosolic enzyme CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). Another cytosolic enzyme  carbonic anhydrase (CAIII)  was rapidly degraded in the lysosomes  making the vacuolar CAIII/SOD ratio useful as a rough indicator of the progress of autophagic-lysosomal degradation. Lysosomes could be recognized by the presence of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein lgp120  which was absent from hepatocytic endosomes. Endocytic inputs into the AVs were detected by the presence of gold-conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA-gold)  taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis. All vacuoles recognized morphologically as AVs were SOD-positive  as were essentially all of the lysosomes (96%). The majority (72%) of the lysosomes also labeled positively for BSA within 2 h of endocytosis. The data are thus compatible with the notion that all lysosomes can engage in both autophagic and endocytic degradation. Lgp120 appeared to distinguish well between lysosomes and nonlysosomal AVs: the lgp120-negative AVs (nonlysosomes) had a CAIII/SOD ratio identical to that of the cytosol  indicating that no degradation had occurred. In the lgp120-positive AVs (lysosomes)  the ratio was only 43% of the cytosolic value  consistent with substantial CAIII degradation. Among the nonlysosomal AVs (about one-third of all AVs)  one-half were BSA-positive  suggesting that early AVs (autophagosomes) and suggesting that early AVs (autophagosomes) and intermediary AVs (amphisomes) that had fused with endosomes were equally abundant. These morphological data thus support previous biochemical evidence for a prelysosomal meeting of the autophagic and endocytic pathways. The microtubule inhibitor vinblastine inhibited the autophagic influx to the lysosomes  causing an accumulation of autophagosomes and a reduction in average lysosomal size. Vinblastine also inhibited the endocytic flux  thereby precluding the formation of amphisomes and of BSA-positive lysosomes. High concentrations (20 mM) of asparagine induced swelling of amphisomes and of BSA-positive lysosomes  probably reflecting an acidotropic effect of ammonia generated by asparagine deamination. Asparagine also caused an accumulation of autophagosomes  amphisomes  and BSA-negative lysosomes  presumably as a result of impaired fusion with the swollen BSA-positive lysosomes. The two agents thus appear to perturb the autophagic-endocytic-lysosomal vacuole dynamics by different mechanisms  making them useful in the further study of these complex organelle interactions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial pruning by Nix and BNip3: an essential function for cardiac-expressed death factors.Programmed cardiac myocyte death via the intrinsic  or mitochondrial  pathway is a mechanism of pathological ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction and during chronic pressure overload hypertrophy. Transcriptional upregulation of the closely related proapoptotic Bcl2 family members BNip3 in ischemic myocardium and Nix in hypertrophied myocardium suggested a molecular mechanism by which programmed cell death can be initiated by cardiac stress and lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Studies using transgenic and gene knockout mice subsequently demonstrated that expression of BNip3 and Nix is both sufficient for cardiomyopathy development and necessary for cardiac remodeling after reversible coronary occlusion and transverse aortic banding  respectively. Here  these data are reviewed in the context of recent findings showing that Nix not only stimulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis but also induces mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) and indirectly activates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore  causing cell necrosis. New findings are presented suggesting that Nix and BNip3 have an essential function  "mitochondrial pruning " that restrains mitochondrial proliferation in cardiomyocytes and without which an age-dependent mitochondrial cardiomyopathy develops.,Autophagy_notLIR
Prion protein functions and dysfunction in prion diseases.Prion diseases are zoonotic infectious diseases caused by infectious particles  termed prions. Main component of prions is presumably a misfolded  partially protease-resistant conformer (PrP(Sc)) of a normal cell surface protein  the cellular prion protein (PrP(C))  whose anti-oxidative role is presumed by studies using prion protein (PrP)-knockout mice and cell lines. Major common features of prion diseases are PrP(Sc) deposition  astrocytosis  and vacuolation  but the presence of these features and transmission route are dependent on the combination of prion strain and host species. Generally  prions replicate first in the lymphoreticular system  although the presence of PrP(Sc) within lymphoid tissues seems to be dependent on factors such as route of prion exposure or type of prion strain. After that  prions travel to the brain via neuronal pathways along peripheral nerves  where their conversion leads to the accumulation of PrP(Sc) and a deficiency of PrP(C)  contributing etiologically to the death of neurons including apoptosis and autophagy. In this review  we provide an overview of current information on PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) as well as their involvement in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apigenin-induced apoptosis is enhanced by inhibition of autophagy formation in HCT116 human colon cancer cells.Apigenin (4' 5 7-trihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid  shown to have chemopreventive and/or anticancer properties in a variety of human cancer cells. The involvement of autophagy in apigenin-induced apoptotic cell death of HCT116 human colon cancer cells was investigated. Apigenin induced suppression of cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner in HCT116 cells. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that apigenin resulted in G2/M phase arrest. This flavone also suppressed the expression of both cyclin B1 and its activating partners  Cdc2 and Cdc25c  whereas the expression of cell cycle inhibitors  such as p53 and p53-dependent p21(CIP1/WAF1)  was increased after apigenin treatment. Apigenin induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and decreased the levels of procaspase-8  -9 and -3. In addition  the apigenin-treated cells exhibited autophagy  as characterized by the appearance of autophagosomes under fluorescence microscopy and the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles by flow cytometry. Furthermore  the results of the western blot analysis revealed that the levels of LC3-II  the processed form of LC3-I  was increased by apigenin. Treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly enhanced the apoptosis induced by apigenin  which was accompanied by an increase in the levels of PARP cleavage. These results indicate that apigenin has apoptosis- and autophagy-inducing effects in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in apigenin-induced apoptosis  and the combination of apigenin and an autophagy inhibitor may be a promising strategy for colon cancer control.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tryptophan depletion and the kinase GCN2 mediate IFN-γ-induced autophagy.IFN-γ is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney  acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself. The cellular responses to IFN-γ are complex  and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-γ may regulate autophagic functions. Conversely  autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts. In this study  we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-γ activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-γ. Our results indicate that IFN-γ promotes tryptophan depletion  activates the eIF2α kinase general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2)  and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux. Further  tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-γ-induced autophagy. This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-γ. These findings assign to IFN-γ a novel function in the regulation of autophagy  which  in turn  modulates IFN-γ-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines.,Autophagy_notLIR
Proteolytic and lipolytic responses to starvation.Mammals survive starvation by activating proteolysis and lipolysis in many different tissues. These responses are triggered  at least in part  by changing hormonal and neural statuses during starvation. Pathways of proteolysis that are activated during starvation are surprisingly diverse  depending on tissue type and duration of starvation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is primarily responsible for increased skeletal muscle protein breakdown during starvation. However  in most other tissues  lysosomal pathways of proteolysis are stimulated during fasting. Short-term starvation activates macroautophagy  whereas long-term starvation activates chaperone-mediated autophagy. Lipolysis also increases in response to starvation  and the breakdown of triacylglycerols provides free fatty acids to be used as an energy source by skeletal muscle and other tissues. In addition  glycerol released from triacylglycerols can be converted to glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. During long-term starvation  oxidation of free fatty acids by the liver leads to the production of ketone bodies that can be used for energy by skeletal muscle and brain. Tissues that cannot use ketone bodies for energy respond to these small molecules by activating chaperone-mediated autophagy. This is one form of interaction between proteolytic and lipolytic responses to starvation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Spatiotemporally controlled initiation of Parkin-mediated mitophagy within single cells.Mitophagy  the selective removal of mitochondria through the autophagic pathway  is involved in cellular mitochondria quality control. Dysfunctional mitochondria can be selectively eliminated through Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Parkin is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that selectively translocates onto impaired mitochondria to initiate mitophagy  and mutations in Parkin have been identified in autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease. Here with the use of a genetically encoded  mitochondria-matrix targeting photosensitizer  we established a robust strategy that allows for spatiotemporally controlled initiation of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in single cells with light. The method can specifically target varying numbers of mitochondria into the Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway for clearance. Combined with live cell imaging  we demonstrated that mitochondria can be cleared by Parkin-mediated mitophagy without juxtanuclear mito-aggresome formation. Autophagy proceeded with the asynchronous appearance of small LC3B-coated structures on Parkin-labeled mitochondria subsections in a nucleation-expansion manner. Our method allows for quantitative measurement on the Parkin-mediated mitophagy process  and can be multiplexed in imaging for higher throughput studies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Immunomodulatory and antibacterial effects of cystatin 9 against Francisella tularensis.Cystatin 9 (CST9) is a member of the type 2 cysteine protease inhibitor family  which has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects that restrain inflammation  but its functions against bacterial infections are unknown. Here  we report that purified human recombinant (r)CST9 protects against the deadly bacterium Francisella tularensis (Ft) in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages infected with the Ft human pathogen Schu 4 (S4)  then given 50 pg of rCST9 exhibited significantly decreased intracellular bacterial replication and increased killing via preventing the escape of S4 from the phagosome. Further  rCST9 induced autophagy in macrophages via the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. rCST9 promoted the upregulation of macrophage proteins involved in antiinflammation and antiapoptosis  while restraining proinflammatory-associated proteins. Interestingly  the viability and virulence of S4 also was decreased directly by rCST9. In a mouse model of Ft inhalation  rCST9 significantly decreased organ bacterial burden and improved survival  which was not accompanied by excessive cytokine secretion or subsequent immune cell migration. The current report is the first to show the immunomodulatory and antimicrobial functions of rCST9 against Ft. We hypothesize that the attenuation of inflammation by rCST9 may be exploited for therapeutic purposes during infection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Processing and presentation of tumor antigens and vaccination strategies.Various new aspects of antigen processing have been uncovered through the study of tumor antigens. One of these is the production of antigenic peptides by splicing of two distinct peptide fragments. In one of the two cases reported  the proteasome was found to be responsible for splicing. The presentation of another peptide on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules was found to depend on secretion and reuptake of the parent protein  implying a cross-presentation pathway in melanoma cells. Class II presentation of peptides derived from cytosolic proteins now appears to result from autophagy. Based on increased knowledge on antigen processing and presentation  new vaccination strategies are aimed at improving the targeting of antigens to dendritic cells  promoting cross-priming (for example  using chloroquine)  improving peptide binding to class I molecules and targeting antigens to both the class I and the class II pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanical stress triggers cardiomyocyte autophagy through angiotensin II type 1 receptor-mediated p38MAP kinase independently of angiotensin II.Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor is known to mediate a variety of physiological actions of Ang II including autophagy. However  the role of AT1 receptor in cardiomyocyte autophagy triggered by mechanical stress still remains elusive. The aim of this study was therefore to examine whether and how AT1 receptor participates in cardiomyocyte autophagy induced by mechanical stresses. A 48-hour mechanical stretch and a 4-week transverse aorta constriction (TAC) were imposed to cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats and adult male C57B/L6 mice  respectively  to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy prior to the assessment of cardiomyocyte autophagy using LC3b-II. Losartan  an AT1 receptor blocker  but not PD123319  the AT2 inhibitor  was found to significantly reduce mechanical stretch-induced LC3b-II upregulation. Moreover  inhibition of p38MAP kinase attenuated not only mechanical stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy but also autophagy. To the contrary  inhibition of ERK and JNK suppressed cardiac hypertrophy but not autophagy. Intriguingly  mechanical stretch-induced autophagy was significantly inhibited by Losartan in the absence of Ang II. Taken together  our results indicate that mechanical stress triggers cardiomyocyte autophagy through AT1 receptor-mediated activation of p38MAP kinase independently of Ang II.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanisms of proteasome inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity in malignant glioma.The 26S proteasome constitutes an essential degradation apparatus involved in the consistent recycling of misfolded and damaged proteins inside cells. The aberrant activation of the proteasome has been widely observed in various types of cancers and implicated in the development and progression of carcinogenesis. In the era of targeted therapies  the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors necessitates a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell death responsible for their cytotoxic action  which are reviewed here in the context of sensitization of malignant gliomas  a tumor type particularly refractory to conventional treatments.,Autophagy_notLIR

Cisplatin-induced downregulation of SOX1 increases drug resistance by activating autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cell.SOX1 was aberrant methylated in hepatocellular cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Long-term cisplatin exposure promotes methylation of SOX1 in ovarian cancer cell  suggesting that SOX1 may be involved in cisplatin resistance. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that cisplatin resistance is associated with alteration of SOX1 expression in NSCLC. Expression of levels of SOX1 was examined using RT-PCR in cisplatin resistance cells and parental cells. The level of SOX1 mRNA in cisplatin resistance cells was markedly reduced when compared to parental cells. Promoter methylation of SOX1 was induced in cisplatin resistance cells. We also found that SOX1 silencing enhanced the cisplatin-mediated autophagy in NSCLC. This study shows that inactivation of SOX1 by promoter hypermethylation  at least in part  is responsible for cisplatin resistance in human NSCLC.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder that is characterized by the presence of the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL that encodes the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. Constitutive expression of BCR-ABL leads to the unregulated production of mature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and their subsequent release into the blood. Untreated  CML will progress from a chronic to accelerated phase over a number of years before quickly proceeding to a terminal blast crisis phase  reminiscent of acute leukemia. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to much improved management of the disease  but these drugs do not provide a cure as they are unable to eradicate the most primitive  quiescent fraction of CML stem cells. This review looks at recent research into targeting CML stem cells and focuses on major signalling pathways of interest.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rab25 in cancer: a brief update.Derailed endocytosis is a hallmark of cancer. The endocytic pathway  as demonstrated by our laboratory  is a frequent target of genomic aberrations in cancer and plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular polarity  stem cell function  bioenergetics  proliferation  motility  invasion  metastasis  apoptosis and autophagy. The Rab GTPases  along with their effectors  are critical regulators of this endocytic machinery and can have a huge impact on the cellular itinerary of growth and metabolism. Rab25 is an epithelial-cell-specific member of the Rab GTPase superfamily  sharing close homology with Rab11a  the endosomal recycling Rab GTPase. RAB25 has been implicated in various cancers  with reports presenting it as both an oncogene and a tumour-suppressor gene. At the cellular level  Rab25 was shown to contribute to invasiveness of cancer cells by regulating integrin trafficking. Recently  our laboratory uncovered a critical role for Rab25 in cellular energetics. Assimilating all of the existing evidence  in the present review  we give an updated overview of the complex and often context-dependent role of Rab25 in cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apelin-13 Prevents the Delayed Neuropathy Induced by Tri-ortho-cresyl Phosphate Through Regulation the Autophagy Flux in Hens.Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) is pathologically characterized by the swollen axon containing aggregations of microtubules  neurofilaments  smooth endoplasmic reticulum and multivesicular vesicles. At present  the exact mechanism of OPIDN is unclear and the effective therapeutic methods is not available to counter this syndrome. Recent studies had shown that the autophagy was involved in OPIDN. The adipocytokine Apelin is a peptide  Apelin and its receptor are abundantly expressed in the nervous system. Recent researches illuminated that Apelin was neuroprotective factor and Apelin could regulate the autophagy in vivo and vitro model. So we investigated the effect of Apelin-13 on the OPIDN induced by Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) in hens and explored the role of autophagy in Apelin-13 preventing OPIDN. Adult Roman hens were given a single dose of 750 mg/kg TOCP by gavage for 21 days to induce OPIDN  and neural dysfunction were detected  and the formation of autophagosomes in spinal cord neurons was observed by transmission electron microscopy  and the molecular markers of autophagy microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) and the autophagy substrates p62/SQSTM1 were determined by Western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that the obvious neurological dysfunction such as hindlimb paralysis and paralysis of gait was present  the number of autophagosomes in the neurons of spinal cords was significantly increased  the level of LC3-II and p62 expressions and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in spinal cords and sciatic nerve were significantly increased in the OPIDN model group compared with the control group. Compared with the OPIDN model group  the neurological dysfunction of tens was obviously reduced  the clinical signs scores was significantly decreased  the number of autophagosomes in the neurons of hen spinal cords was significantly decreased  the level of LC3-II and p62 expressions and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in spinal cords and sciatic nerve were significantly decreased in Apelin-13 treatment group. Our results suggested that Apelin-13 prevented against the OPIDN induced by TOCP in hens  which the mechanism might be associated with regulation autophagy flux by Apelin-13.,Autophagy_notLIR
FTY720 induces autophagy-related apoptosis and necroptosis in human glioblastoma cells.FTY720 is a potent immunosuppressant which has preclinical antitumor efficacy in various cancer models. However  its role in glioblastoma remains unclear. In the present study  we found that FTY720 induced extrinsic apoptosis  necroptosis and autophagy in human glioblastoma cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either RNA interference or chemical inhibitors attenuated FTY720-induced apoptosis and necrosis. Furthermore  autophagy  apoptosis and necrosis induction were dependent on reactive oxygen species-c-Jun N-terminal kinase-protein 53 (ROS-JNK-p53) loop mediated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase (PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K) pathway. In addition  receptor-interacting protein 1 and 3 (RIP1 and RIP3) served as an upstream of ROS-JNK-p53 loop. However  the phosphorylation form of FTY720 induced autophagy but not apoptosis and necroptosis. Finally  the in vitro results were validated in vivo in xenograft mouse of glioblastoma cells. In conclusion  the current study provided novel insights into understanding the mechanisms and functions of FTY720-induced apoptosis  necroptosis and autophagy in human glioblastoma cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effect of temozolomide on the U-118 glioma cell line.Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most lethal subtype of astrocytomas  with a mean patient survival rate of 12 months after diagnosis. The gold standard treatment of GBM  which includes surgery followed by the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ)  increases the survival rate to 14.6 months. The success of TMZ appears to be limited by the occurrence of chemoresistance that allows glioma cells to escape from death signaling pathways. However  the mechanism of TMZ action is yet to be clarified although some controversial results have been reported. Therefore  our aim was to evaluate the occurrence of apoptosis and autophagy in glioma cells treated with TMZ and to correlate TMZ action with the survival pathways Pi3K/Akt and ERK1/2 MAP kinase. Cell proliferation was evaluated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Apoptosis was studied by flow cytometry as well as by fluorescence confocal microscopy in order to evaluate the sub G0/G1 percentage of cells and chromatin condensation. The expression of the autophagy-associated protein  LC3  as well as Akt and ERK1/2 was performed by Western blotting. In TMZ-treated GBM cells the expression of LC3  the autophagy-associated protein was increased and only a reduced percentage of cells underwent apoptosis. In addition  we showed that the phosphorylation status of Pi3K/Akt and ERK1/2 MAP kinase was maintained during the treatment with TMZ  suggesting that glioma cells escape from TMZ-induced cell death due to these signaling pathways. The chemoresistance of U-118 cells to TMZ was partially eradicated when cells were simultaneously treated with specific inhibitors of Pi3K/Akt and ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathways and TMZ. Therefore  we hypothesized that in order to induce glioma cell death it is essential to evaluate the activation of the survival pathways and establish a combined therapy using TMZ and inhibitors of those signaling pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Immune-related gene signatures predict the outcome of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.There is ample evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast carcinoma is particularly efficient if the tumor presents signs of either a pre-existent or therapy-induced anticancer immune response. Antineoplastic chemotherapies are particularly beneficial if they succeed in inducing immunogenic cell death  hence converting the tumor into its own therapeutic vaccine. Immunogenic cell death is characterized by a pre-mortem stress response including endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy. Based on these premises  we attempted to identify metagenes that reflect an intratumoral immune response or local stress responses in the transcriptomes of breast cancer patients. No consistent correlations between immune- and stress-related metagenes could be identified across several cohorts of patients  representing a total of 1045 mammary carcinomas. Moreover  few if any  of the stress-relevant metagenes influenced the probability of pathological complete response to chemotherapy. In contrast  several immune-relevant metagenes had a significant positive impact on response rates. This applies in particular to a CXCL13-centered  highly reproducible metagene signature reflecting the intratumoral presence of interferon-γ-producing T cells.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy gene polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to leprosy by affecting inflammatory cytokines.Autophagy and inflammation closely interact with each other  and together  they play critical roles in bacterial infection. Leprosy is caused by the infection of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). The objective of the study was to investigate the association between polymorphisms in IRGM  an autophagy gene  and susceptibility to leprosy  and identify possible functions of the polymorphism in the infection of M. leprae. Two polymorphisms in IRGM  rs4958842 and rs13361189  were tested in 412 leprosy cases and 432 healthy controls. Levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 beta  IL-4  IL-6  and interferon gamma (INF-γ) were measured after the infection of M. leprae in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of subjects with different genotypes of rs13361189. Data showed that prevalence of rs13361189TC and CC genotypes were significantly higher in leprosy patients than in healthy controls (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49  95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.04  P = 0.012; OR = 2.58  95 % CI 1.65-4.05  P < 0.001; respectively). Furthermore  the frequency of rs13361189CC genotype was increased in patients with complications than those without complications (P = 0.011). When analyzing the effect of rs13361189 polymorphism on M. leprae infection  we identified that M. leprae-infected PBMC with rs13361189CC genotype expressed significantly elevated levels of INF-γ and IL-4 than those with TT genotype. Our results suggested autophagy gene polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of leprosy by affecting inflammatory cytokines.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dysfunctional lysosomal autophagy leads to peroxisomal oxidative burnout and damage during endotoxin-induced stress.Mammalian peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that possess a comprehensive ensemble of more than 50 enzymes. Cells regulate the number of organelles through dynamic interplay between biogenesis and degradation. Under basal conditions  approximately 30% of the peroxisomal pool is turned over daily. Recycling of peroxisomes is necessary for preservation of their functional competence  and correctly functioning autophagic/lysosomal pathways play a central role. In this study  we investigated (1) how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) influences peroxisomal dynamics and functions; and (2) how a superimposed lysosomal dysfunction affects pexophagy and modifies peroxisomal responses to LPS. We demonstrated that a transiently increased autophagic degradation of peroxisomes  pexophagy  followed by increased proliferation of peroxisomes is a default response to endotoxic stress. Impairment of autophagy due to lysosomal dysfunction  however  abolishes the above peroxisomal dynamics and results in accumulation of functionally compromised peroxisomes. These exhibit an imbalance between preserved hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2)-generating acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and dysfunctional/inactivated catalase (CAT)  which leads to intra-peroxisomal redox disequilibrium. This metabolic-oxidative mismatch causes further worsening of peroxisomal functions  peroxisomal burnout  with the consequence of enhanced oxidative stress and aggravated organ injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activating transcription factor 6 limits intracellular accumulation of mutant α(1)-antitrypsin Z and mitochondrial damage in hepatoma cells.α(1)-Antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor secreted by hepatocytes. A variant of α(1)-antitrypsin with an E342K (Z) mutation (ATZ) has propensity to form polymers  is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  is degraded by both ER-associated degradation and autophagy  and causes hepatocyte loss. Constant features in hepatocytes of PiZZ individuals and in PiZ transgenic mice expressing ATZ are the formation of membrane-limited globular inclusions containing ATZ and mitochondrial damage. Expression of ATZ in the liver does not induce the unfolded protein response (UPR)  a protective mechanism aimed to maintain ER homeostasis in the face of an increased load of proteins. Here we found that in hepatoma cells the ER E3 ligase HRD1 functioned to degrade most of the ATZ before globular inclusions are formed. Activation of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branch of the UPR by expression of spliced ATF6(1-373) decreased intracellular accumulation of ATZ and the formation of globular inclusions by a pathway that required HRD1 and the proteasome. Expression of ATF6(1-373) in ATZ-expressing hepatoma cells did not induce autophagy and increased the level of the proapoptotic factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) but did not lead to apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Expression of ATF6(1-373) did not cause inhibition of protein synthesis and prevented mitochondrial damage induced by ATZ expression. It was concluded that activation of the ATF6 pathway of the UPR limits ATZ-dependent cell toxicity by selectively promoting ER-associated degradation of ATZ and is thereby a potential target to prevent hepatocyte loss in addition to autophagy-enhancing drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR

Axin expression delays herpes simplex virus-induced autophagy and enhances viral replication in L929 cells.Axin  a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway  plays a critical role in various cellular events including cell proliferation and cell death. Axin-regulated cell death affects multiple processes  including viral replication. For example  axin expression suppresses herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced necrotic cell death and enhances viral replication. Based on these observations  this study investigated the involvement of autophagy in regulation of HSV replication and found axin expression inhibits autophagy-mediated suppression of viral replication in L929 cells. HSV infection induced autophagy in a time- and viral dose-dependent manner in control L929 cells (L-EV)  whereas virus-induced autophagy was delayed in axin-expressing L929 cells (L-axin). Subsequent analysis showed that induction of autophagy by rapamycin reduced HSV replication  and that inhibiting autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3MA) and beclin-1 knockdown facilitated viral replication in L-EV cells. In addition  preventing autophagy with 3MA suppressed virus-induced cytotoxicity in L-EV cells. In contrast  HSV replication in L-axin cells was resistant to changes in autophagy. These results suggest that axin expression may render L929 cells resistant to HSV-infection induced autophagy  leading to enhanced viral replication.,Autophagy_notLIR
RNase L Cleavage Products Promote Switch from Autophagy to Apoptosis by Caspase-Mediated Cleavage of Beclin-1.Autophagy and apoptosis share regulatory molecules enabling crosstalk in pathways that affect cellular homeostasis including response to viral infections and survival of tumor cells. Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is an antiviral endonuclease that is activated in virus-infected cells and cleaves viral and cellular single-stranded RNAs to produce small double-stranded RNAs with roles in amplifying host responses. Activation of RNase L induces autophagy and apoptosis in many cell types. However  the mechanism by which RNase L mediates crosstalk between these two pathways remains unclear. Here we show that small dsRNAs produced by RNase L promote a switch from autophagy to apoptosis by caspase-mediated cleavage of Beclin-1  terminating autophagy. The caspase 3-cleaved C-terminal fragment of Beclin-1 enhances apoptosis by translocating to the mitochondria along with proapoptotic protein  Bax  and inducing release of cytochrome C to the cytosol. Cleavage of Beclin-1 determines switch to apoptosis since expression of caspase-resistant Beclin-1 inhibits apoptosis and sustains autophagy. Moreover  inhibiting RNase L-induced autophagy promotes cell death and inhibiting apoptosis prolongs autophagy in a cross-inhibitory mechanism. Our results demonstrate a novel role of RNase L generated small RNAs in cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis that impacts the fate of cells during viral infections and cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Reversibility of lysosomal and glucose 6-phosphatase changes produced in the rat liver by dimethylnitrosamine.The present investigation was undertaken to discover whether repeated doses of dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA) could produce a cumulative toxic effect on the rat liver. For this purpose doses were selected at a level just too low to produce cytopathological changes  as indicated by depression of glucose-6-phosphatase and induction of autophagic vacuoles (AV) in hepatocytes  when given once only. Single subcutaneous injections of 10 or 3 mg/kg induced these cytopathological changes in the centrilobular (CLB) hepatic cells but when the dose was reduced to 1 mg/kg no such changes were seen. After daily administration of 1 mg/kg for 4 or 8 weeks we observed both glucose-6-phosphatase depression and autophagy  and in addition there was marked hypertrophy of the rough endoplasmic reticulum  nucleolar microsegregation and the appearance of distorted  often ring-shaped mitochondria with shortened cristae. Kupffer cells exhibited a marked increase in lysosomal activity. With the exception of mitochondrial changes and Kupffer cell activity this same picture was observed  although in milder form  when the dose administered was 0.3 or 0.1 mg/kg daily for the same period. When treatment was continued for 12 weeks  however  the only differences from control rats were the presence of hypertrophied rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) at all three dose levels  nucleolar microsegregation at the upper two dose levels  and pronounced Kupffer cell activity at the top dose. These findings indicate that cumulative cytopathologic effects occur only up to 8 weeks at the dose levels studied but hypertrophy of RER and increased Kupffer cell activity persist up to 12 weeks.,Autophagy_notLIR
Analysis of the native conformation of the LIR/AIM motif in the Atg8/LC3/GABARAP-binding proteins.The Atg8/LC3/GABARAP family of proteins  a group that has structural homology with ubiquitin  connects with a large set of binding partners to function in macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy). This interaction occurs primarily via a conserved motif termed the LC3-interacting region (LIR)  or the Atg8-interacting motif (AIM). The consensus sequence for this motif  [W/F/Y]xx[L/I/V]  can be found in many proteins  but only some of them are physiological partners containing a functional LIR/AIM. Because the structure of many full-length partners has not been  or cannot be  solved  the structural context of the LIR/AIM within the native protein conformation is not obvious. Here we suggest that the functional LIR/AIM is a short linear motif (SLiM) protein-binding module  arising from an intrinsically disordered region. This finding enables the rapid elimination of some false Atg8/LC3/GABARAP-binding proteins  and connects the exponentially growing knowledge on disordered SLiMs with autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
A new in vitro model to delay high phosphate-induced vascular calcification progression.An increasing amount of patients affected by advanced chronic kidney disease suffer from vascular calcification (VC) that associates with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this study  we created a new experimental in vitro model  trying to better elucidate high phosphate (Pi)-induced VC pathogenic mechanisms. Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were challenged for 7-10 days with high Pi with a repeated and short suspensions of high Pi treatment (intermittent suspension  IS) that was able to induce a significant inhibition of high Pi calcification  maximal at 5 h. Interestingly  the delay in calcification is a consequence of either the absence of free Pi or calcium-phosphate crystals being comparable to the total effect obtained during the 5 h-IS. The protective effect of IS was mediated by the reduction of apoptosis as demonstrated by the action of 20 μmol/L Z-VAD-FMK and by the preservation of the pro-survival receptor Axl expression. Furthermore  autophagy  during IS  was potentiated by increasing the autophagic flux  evaluated by LC3IIB western  while treating VSMCs with 1 mmol/L valproic acid did not affect VC. Finally  IS prevented VSMC osteoblastic differentiation by preserving smooth muscle lineage markers expression. Our data support the hypothesis that to delay significantly VC is necessary and sufficient the IS of high Pi challenge. The IS was able to prevent significantly apoptosis  to induce a potentiation in autophagy  and to prevent osteoblastic differentiation by preserving SM lineage markers.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeted cellular metabolism for cancer chemotherapy with recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes.It has been shown that a subset of human cancers  notably  melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are auxotrophic for arginine (Arg)  because they do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)  the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of arginine from citrulline. These ASS-negative cancer cells require Arg from extracellular sources for survival. When they are exposed to recombinant Arg-degrading enzymes  e.g. arginine deiminase (ADI) or arginase  they die because of Arg starvation; whereas normal cells which express ASS are able to survive. A pegylated ADI (ADI-PEG20) has been developed for clinical trials for advanced melanoma and HCC; and favorable results have been obtained. ADI-PEG20 treatment induces autophagy in auxotrophic cancer cells leading to cell death. Clinical studies in melanoma patients show that re-expression of ASS is associated with ADI-PEG20 resistance. ADI-PEG20 treatment down-regulates the expression of HIF-1α but up-regulates c-Myc in culture melanoma cells. Induction of ASS by ADI-PEG20 involves positive regulators c-Myc and Sp4 and negative regulator HIF1α. Since both HIF-1α and c-Myc play important roles in cancer cell energy metabolism  together these results suggest that targeted cancer cell metabolism through modulation of HIF-1α and c-Myc expression may improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 in treating Arg auxotrophic tumors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy regulates programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.The plant innate immune response includes the hypersensitive response (HR)  a form of programmed cell death (PCD). PCD must be restricted to infection sites to prevent the HR from playing a pathologic rather than protective role. Here we show that plant BECLIN 1  an ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene ATG6/VPS30/beclin 1  functions to restrict HR PCD to infection sites. Initiation of HR PCD is normal in BECLIN 1-deficient plants  but remarkably  healthy uninfected tissue adjacent to HR lesions and leaves distal to the inoculated leaf undergo unrestricted PCD. In the HR PCD response  autophagy is induced in both pathogen-infected cells and distal uninfected cells; this is reduced in BECLIN 1-deficient plants. The restriction of HR PCD also requires orthologs of other autophagy-related genes including PI3K/VPS34  ATG3  and ATG7. Thus  the evolutionarily conserved autophagy pathway plays an essential role in plant innate immunity and negatively regulates PCD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Combined autophagy and proteasome inhibition: a phase 1 trial of hydroxychloroquine and bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma.The efficacy of proteasome inhibition for myeloma is limited by therapeutic resistance  which may be mediated by activation of the autophagy pathway as an alternative mechanism of protein degradation. Preclinical studies demonstrate that autophagy inhibition with hydroxychloroquine augments the antimyeloma efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. We conducted a phase I trial combining bortezomib and hydroxychloroquine for relapsed or refractory myeloma. We enrolled 25 patients  including 11 (44%) refractory to prior bortezomib. No protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities occurred  and we identified a recommended phase 2 dose of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg twice daily with standard doses of bortezomib  at which we observed dose-related gastrointestinal toxicity and cytopenias. Of 22 patients evaluable for response  3 (14%) had very good partial responses  3 (14%) had minor responses  and 10 (45%) had a period of stable disease. Electron micrographs of bone marrow plasma cells collected at baseline  after a hydroxychloroquine run-in  and after combined therapy showed therapy-associated increases in autophagic vacuoles  consistent with the combined effects of increased trafficking of misfolded proteins to autophagic vacuoles and inhibition of their degradative capacity. Combined targeting of proteasomal and autophagic protein degradation using bortezomib and hydroxychloroquine is therefore feasible and a potentially useful strategy for improving outcomes in myeloma therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ribosomal protein mutations induce autophagy through S6 kinase inhibition of the insulin pathway.Mutations affecting the ribosome lead to several diseases known as ribosomopathies  with phenotypes that include growth defects  cytopenia  and bone marrow failure. Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)  for example  is a pure red cell aplasia linked to the mutation of ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Here we show the knock-down of the DBA-linked RPS19 gene induces the cellular self-digestion process of autophagy  a pathway critical for proper hematopoiesis. We also observe an increase of autophagy in cells derived from DBA patients  in CD34+ erythrocyte progenitor cells with RPS19 knock down  in the red blood cells of zebrafish embryos with RP-deficiency  and in cells from patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). The loss of RPs in all these models results in a marked increase in S6 kinase phosphorylation that we find is triggered by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We show that this increase in S6 kinase phosphorylation inhibits the insulin pathway and AKT phosphorylation activity through a mechanism reminiscent of insulin resistance. While stimulating RP-deficient cells with insulin reduces autophagy  antioxidant treatment reduces S6 kinase phosphorylation  autophagy  and stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor. Our data suggest that RP loss promotes the aberrant activation of both S6 kinase and p53 by increasing intracellular ROS levels. The deregulation of these signaling pathways is likely playing a major role in the pathophysiology of ribosomopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
ENTPD5-mediated modulation of ATP results in altered metabolism and decreased survival in gliomablastoma multiforme.Gliomablastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive of brain cancers in humans. Response to current therapies remains extremely poor  with dismal survival statistics. Recently  the endoplasmic reticulum UDPase  ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5 (ENTPD5)  was identified as a key component in the Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog regulatory loop  capable of synergizing aerobic glycolysis and cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Utilizing a novel enhanced acceptor fluorescence-based single-cell adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) biosensor  we analyzed ENTPD5-mediated modulation of cytosolic ATP. Here  ENTPD5-dependent modulation of cellular ATP in GBM results in altered metabolic kinetics in vitro  increasing the catabolic efficiencies of aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally  an upregulation of ENTPD5 in both GBM mouse xenografts and in GBM patient tumors was identified  resulting in dramatically reduced survival. Therefore  these results not only provide new tools to monitor ATP flux and cellular metabolism kinetics but also identified a novel therapeutic target for GBM.,Autophagy_notLIR
CD40 ligand and interferon-γ induce an antimicrobial response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human monocytes.The ability of T cells to activate antimicrobial pathways in infected macrophages is essential to host defence against many intracellular pathogens. Here  we compared the ability of two T-cell-mediated mechanisms to trigger antimicrobial responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans  CD40 activation and the release of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Given that IFN-γ activates a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response  we focused on induction of the key components of this pathway. We show that activation of human monocytes via CD40 ligand (CD40L) and IFN-γ  alone  and in combination  induces the CYP27b1-hydroxylase  responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to the bioactive 1 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1 25D)  and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The activation of the vitamin D pathway by CD40L and IFN-γ results in up-regulated expression of the antimicrobial peptides  cathelicidin and DEFB4  as well as induction of autophagy. Finally  activation of monocytes via CD40L and IFN-γ results in an antimicrobial activity against intracellular M. tuberculosis. Our data suggest that at least two parallel T-cell-mediated mechanisms  CD40L and IFN-γ  activate the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway and trigger antimicrobial activity against intracellular M. tuberculosis  thereby contributing to human host defence against intracellular infection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Candida albicans autophagy  no longer a bystander: Its role in tolerance to ER stress-related antifungal drugs.Autophagy is a degradation process involved in pathogenicity of many pathogenic fungi. However  its roles in Candida albicans  the leading fungal pathogen in human beings  remain to be detailed. Most recently  we found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing conditions led to transcriptional up-regulation of C. albicans autophagy-related (ATG) genes  implying a possible link between autophagy and ER stress response in this pathogen. Using a series of C. albicans ATG mutants and autophagy reporting systems  we found that both treatment of ER stress-related drugs and loss of the ER calcium pump Spf1 promoted autophagic flux of Atg8 and Lap41 (a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ape1)  indicating that these conditions induce autophagy. Moreover  deletion of ATG genes in the spf1Δ/Δ mutant rendered cells hypersensitive to these drugs and caused activation of UPR  revealing a role of autophagy in alleviating ER stress. In addition  only treatment of tunicamycin and loss of Spf1 in combination increased autophagic flux of the ER component Sec63  suggesting that most of the ER stress-related conditions cause non-selective autophagy rather than selective ER phagy. This study uncovers the important role of C. albicans autophagy in ER stress response and tolerance to antifungal drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR
mir-30d Regulates multiple genes in the autophagy pathway and impairs autophagy process in human cancer cells.In human epithelial cancers  the microRNA (miRNA) mir-30d is amplified with high frequency and serves as a critical oncomir by regulating metastasis  apoptosis  proliferation  and differentiation. Autophagy  a degradation pathway for long-lived protein and organelles  regulates the survival and death of many cell types. Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important function in epithelial tumor initiation and progression. Using a combined bioinformatics approach  gene set enrichment analysis  and miRNA target prediction  we found that mir-30d might regulate multiple genes in the autophagy pathway including BECN1  BNIP3L  ATG12  ATG5  and ATG2. Our further functional experiments demonstrated that the expression of these core proteins in the autophagy pathway was directly suppressed by mir-30d in cancer cells. Finally  we showed that mir-30d regulated the autophagy process by inhibiting autophagosome formation and LC3B-I conversion to LC3B-II. Taken together  our results provide evidence that the oncomir mir-30d impairs the autophagy process by targeting multiple genes in the autophagy pathway. This result will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of mir-30d in tumorigenesis and developing novel cancer therapy strategy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 family protein HPL-2 maintains ER homeostasis through the UPR and hormesis.Cellular adaptation to environmental changes and stress relies on a wide range of regulatory mechanisms that are tightly controlled at several levels  including transcription. Chromatin structure and chromatin binding proteins are important factors contributing to the transcriptional response to stress. However  it remains largely unknown to what extent specific chromatin factors influence the response to distinct forms of stress in a developmental context. One of the best characterized stress response pathways is the unfolded protein response (UPR)  which is activated by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here  we show that Caenorhabditis elegans heterochromatin protein like-2 (HPL-2)  the homolog of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)  down-regulates the UPR in the intestine. Inactivation of HPL-2 results in an enhanced resistance to ER stress dependent on the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1)/inositol requiring enzyme 1 branch of the UPR and the closely related process of autophagy. Increased resistance to ER stress in animals lacking HPL-2 is associated with increased basal levels of XBP-1 activation and ER chaperone expression under physiological conditions  which may in turn activate an adaptive response known as ER hormesis. HPL-2 expression in intestinal cells is sufficient to rescue stress resistance  whereas expression in neuronal cells negatively influenced the ER stress response through a cell-nonautonomous mechanism. We further show that the retinoblastoma protein homolog LIN-35 and the LIN-13 zinc finger protein act in the same pathway as HPL-2 to limit the ER stress response. Altogether  our results point to multiple functions for HP1 in different cell types to maintain ER homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Function of α-synuclein and PINK1 in Lewy body dementia (Review).α-Synuclein (α-syn) is the major protein component of Lewy bodies  a key pathological characteristic of the degenerating brain. The misfolding and aggregation of α-syn is associated with both the idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). However  the function of α-syn is poorly understood  as it shows both neurotoxic and neuroprotective activities. Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) also cause recessively inherited PD. Studies support the notion of neuroprotective roles for PINK1  as it protects cells from damage-induced mitochondrial dysfunction  oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. PINK1 plays an essential role in mitochondrial quality control and its homeostasis is maintained through mitochondrial stabilization. The α-syn aggregation is linked to various aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction and PINK1-related mitophagy. Determination of the molecular pathways that lead to α-syn oligomerization and further aggregation may be the basis for the successful design and development of treatments for these neurodegenerative diseases. The present review summarizes the function of PINK1 underlying α-syn aggregation and the mechanisms through which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in this process.,Autophagy_notLIR
From autophagy to senescence and apoptosis in Angiotensin II-treated vascular endothelial cells.The aim of this study was to explore if cell autophagy is activated by AngII before aging using human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). The ultrastructural analysis of HUVECs was performed to observe autophagosomes. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was determined by western blot assay. The β-gal staining was used to identify cell senescence. The flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell apoptosis. The BH3 domain analog ABT737 or Beclin-1 knockdown by specific shRNA or valsartan was applied to investigate their effects on cell autophagy  senescence  and apoptosis induced by Ang II. Cell autophagy was initiated after Ang II treatment at 24 h. And cell senescence and apoptosis were observed in Ang II-treated cells at 48 h. The significant interaction of Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 was detected at 48 h after Ang II treatment. Beclin-1 was indispensable to Ang II-induced autophagy  and its BH3 domain was required for the interaction with Bcl-2 to attenuate autophagy. Pretreated with valsartan  cells were present with less autophagic  senescent  and apoptotic cells after Ang II stimulation. In conclusion  Ang II induced autophagy  senescence  and apoptosis of HUVECs progressively  and autophagy presented an early protective effect on vascular endothelial damage due to Ang II.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy induction by a natural ingredient of areca nut.We recently identified an autophagy-inducing areca nut ingredient (AIAI) in the partially purified 30-100 kDa fraction of areca nut extract (ANE)  designated as ANE 30-100K. Before disintegration  most ANE 30-100K-treated cells exhibit rounding morphology  cytoplasmic clearance  and nuclear shrinkage  distinct from arecoline- and cisplatin-induced cellular apoptosis. This unique death pattern is verified to be autophagy by LC3-I cleavage  acidic vesicles  and autophagic vacuoles. As analyzed by Molish's Test  Selinowaff's Test  and thin-layer chromatography  most of the ANE 30-100K constituents are carbohydrates  whereas the protein content of this fraction is less than 1% as assessed by protein assay reagent. The cytotoxicity of ANE 30-100K is further shown to be sensitive to cellulase and proteinase K digestion suggesting AIAI in ANE 30-100K to be a proteoglycan (or glycoprotein). Thus  although ANE contains apoptosis-inducing ingredients such as arecoline  it predominantly triggers autophagic cell death by this natural AIAI.,Autophagy_notLIR
Broad targeting of resistance to apoptosis in cancer.Apoptosis or programmed cell death is natural way of removing aged cells from the body. Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However  in cancer  de-regulated apoptotic signaling  particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems  allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival  therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented. This review provides a roadmap for the design of successful anti-cancer strategies that overcome resistance to apoptosis for better therapeutic outcome in patients with cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sperm-inherited organelle clearance in C. elegans relies on LC3-dependent autophagosome targeting to the pericentrosomal area.Macroautophagic degradation of sperm-inherited organelles prevents paternal mitochondrial DNA transmission in C. elegans. The recruitment of autophagy markers around sperm mitochondria has also been observed in mouse and fly embryos but their role in degradation is debated. Both worm Atg8 ubiquitin-like proteins  LGG-1/GABARAP and LGG-2/LC3  are recruited around sperm organelles after fertilization. Whereas LGG-1 depletion affects autophagosome function  stabilizes the substrates and is lethal  we demonstrate that LGG-2 is dispensable for autophagosome formation but participates in their microtubule-dependent transport toward the pericentrosomal area prior to acidification. In the absence of LGG-2  autophagosomes and their substrates remain clustered at the cell cortex  away from the centrosomes and their associated lysosomes. Thus  the clearance of sperm organelles is delayed and their segregation between blastomeres prevented. This allowed us to reveal a role of the RAB-5/RAB-7 GTPases in autophagosome formation. In conclusion  the major contribution of LGG-2 in sperm-inherited organelle clearance resides in its capacity to mediate the retrograde transport of autophagosomes rather than their fusion with acidic compartments: a potential key function of LC3 in controlling the fate of sperm mitochondria in other species.,Autophagy_notLIR

Protective role of autophagy in AGE-induced early injury of human vascular endothelial cells.Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis by promoting vascular endothelial cell proliferation  migration  damage and death. In this study  we examined the role of autophagy in HUVECs exposed to AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA). HUVECs incubated with AGE-BSA for 6 h showed an increase in the formation of acidic vesicular organelles and autophagosomes. AGE-BSA-induced upregulation of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II)  a marker of autophagy  was abolished by pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA)  and was increased by rapamycin  an autophagy inducer. The increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage induced by AGE-BSA was increased by 3-MA  but not rapamycin. An oxidative inhibitor  α-tocopherol  decreased not only the AGE-BSA-induced increase of reactive oxygen species  but also the upregulation of LC3-II protein levels. These results suggest that AGE-BSA increases the level of autophagy  which is protective against HUVEC injury  and that ROS play a role in this activation of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy defends pancreatic β cells from human islet amyloid polypeptide-induced toxicity.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by a deficiency in β cell mass  increased β cell apoptosis  and extracellular accumulation of islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)  which β cells coexpress with insulin. IAPP expression is increased in the context of insulin resistance  the major risk factor for developing T2D. Human IAPP is potentially toxic  especially as membrane-permeant oligomers  which have been observed to accumulate within β cells of patients with T2D and rodents expressing human IAPP. Here  we determined that β cell IAPP content is regulated by autophagy through p62-dependent lysosomal degradation. Induction of high levels of human IAPP in mouse β cells resulted in accumulation of this amyloidogenic protein as relatively inert fibrils within cytosolic p62-positive inclusions  which temporarily averts formation of toxic oligomers. Mice hemizygous for transgenic expression of human IAPP did not develop diabetes; however  loss of β cell-specific autophagy in these animals induced diabetes  which was attributable to accumulation of toxic human IAPP oligomers and loss of β cell mass. In human IAPP-expressing mice that lack β cell autophagy  increased oxidative damage and loss of an antioxidant-protective pathway appeared to contribute to increased β cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that autophagy/lysosomal degradation defends β cells against proteotoxicity induced by oligomerization-prone human IAPP.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy as a pro-death pathway.The evolutionarily conserved catabolic process of autophagy involves the degradation of cytoplasmic components through lysosomal enzymes. Basal levels of autophagy maintain cellular homeostasis and under stress conditions high levels of autophagy are induced. It is often under such stress conditions that high levels of autophagy and cell death have been observed  leading to the idea that autophagy may act as an executioner of cell death. However the notion of autophagy as a cell death mechanism has been controversial and remains mechanistically undefined. There is now growing evidence that in specific contexts autophagy can indeed facilitate cell death. The pro-death role of autophagy is however complicated due to the extensive cross-talk between different signalling pathways. This review summarises the examples of where autophagy acts as a means of cell death and discusses the association of autophagy with the different cell death pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy and ethanol neurotoxicity.Excessive ethanol exposure is detrimental to the brain. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not declined  it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells  and is involved in cell differentiation  survival  metabolism  and immunity. We have recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis  whereas inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated; their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress  modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling  alterations in BCL2 family proteins  and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. This review discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in ethanol-mediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of targeting autophagic pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Multiple effects of the Na(+)/H (+) antiporter inhibitor HMA on cancer cells.Amiloride derivatives are a class of new promising chemotherapeutic agents. A representative member of this family is the sodium-hydrogen antiporter inhibitor HMA (5-(N N-hexamethylene amiloride)  which has been demonstrated to induce cellular intracytosolic acidification and cell death through the apoptotic pathway(s). This work aims at characterizing drug response of human cancer cell lines to HMA. After a first screening revealing that HMA interferes with cancer cell survival  we focused our attention on SW613-B3 colon carcinoma cells  which are intrinsically resistant to a panel of drugs. Searching for the activation of canonical apoptosis  we found that this process was abortive  given that the final steps of this process  i.e. PARP-1 cleavage and DNA ladder  were not detectable. Thus  we addressed caspase-independent paradigms of cell death and we observed that HMA promotes the induction of the LEI/L-DNase II pathway as well as of parthanatos. Finally  we explored the possible impact of autophagy of cell response to HMA  providing the evidence that autophagy is activated in our experimental system. On the whole  our results defined the biochemical reactions triggered by HMA  and elucidated its multiple effects  thus adding further complexity to the intricate network leading to drug resistance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pharmacologically directed cell disposal: labeling damaged cells for phagocytosis as a strategy against acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis is a common clinical condition  which lacks effective pharmacological treatment. The severity of the disease is determined by the extent of necrotic death of pancreatic acinar cells. This article discusses the idea of developing new pharmacological tools against acute pancreatitis by labeling necrotic pancreatic acinar with apoptotic “eat-me” signaling molecules. This approach could facilitate removal of dead material without activation of inflammatory response and thus would eliminate the main source of damage to the body during acute pancreatitis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and endocrine resistance in breast cancer.The American Cancer Society estimates that over 200 000 new breast cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the USA alone. Of these cases  the majority are invasive breast cancers and almost 70% are estrogen receptor-α positive. Therapies targeting the estrogen receptor-α are widely applied and include selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen  a selective estrogen receptor downregulator such as Fulvestrant (Faslodex; FAS  ICI 182 780)  or one of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors including letrozole or anastrozole. While these treatments reduce breast cancer mortality  many estrogen receptor-α-positive tumors eventually recur  highlighting the clinical significance of endocrine therapy resistance. The signaling leading to endocrine therapy resistance is poorly understood; however  preclinical studies have established an important role for autophagy in the acquired resistance phenotype. Autophagy is a cellular degradation process initiated in response to stress or nutrient deprivation  which attempts to restore metabolic homeostasis through the catabolic lysis of aggregated proteins  unfolded/misfolded proteins or damaged subcellular organelles. The duality of autophagy  which can be either pro-survival or pro-death  is well known. However  in the context of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer  the inhibition of autophagy can potentiate resensitization of previously antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells. In this article  we discuss the complex and occasionally contradictory roles of autophagy in cancer and in resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mask loss-of-function rescues mitochondrial impairment and muscle degeneration of Drosophila pink1 and parkin mutants.PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) and ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin function in a linear pathway to maintain healthy mitochondria via regulating mitochondrial clearance and trafficking. Mutations in the two enzymes cause the familial form of Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans  as well as accumulation of defective mitochondria and cellular degeneration in flies. Here  we show that loss of function of a scaffolding protein Mask  also known as ANKHD1 (Ankyrin repeats and KH domain containing protein 1) in humans  rescues the behavioral  anatomical and cellular defects caused by pink1 or parkin mutations in a cell-autonomous manner. Moreover  similar rescue can also be achieved if Mask knock-down is induced in parkin adult flies when the mitochondrial dystrophy is already manifested. We found that Mask genetically interacts with Parkin to modulate mitochondrial morphology and negatively regulates the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria. We also provide evidence that loss of Mask activity promotes co-localization of the autophagosome marker with mitochondria in developing larval muscle  and that an intact autophagy pathway is required for the rescue of parkin mutant defects by mask loss of function. Together  our data strongly suggest that Mask/ANKHD1 activity can be inhibited in a tissue- and timely-controlled fashion to restore mitochondrial integrity under PD-linked pathological conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Roles of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in curcumin-induced autophagy.Curcumin has a potent anticancer effect and is a promising new therapeutic strategy. We previously demonstrated that curcumin induced non-apoptotic autophagic cell death in malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. This compound inhibited the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase pathway and activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 thereby inducing autophagy. Interestingly  activation of the first pathway inhibited curcumin-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity  whereas inhibition of the latter pathway inhibited curcumin-induced autophagy and induced apoptosis  thus augmenting the cytotoxicity of curcumin. These results imply that these two autophagic pathways have opposite effects on curcumin's cytotoxicity. However  inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB  which is the main target of curcumin for its anticancer effect  was not observed in malignant glioma cells. These results suggest that autophagy but not nuclear factor kappaB plays a central role in curcumin anticancer therapy and warrant further investigation toward application in patients with malignant gliomas. Here  we discuss the therapeutic role of two autophagic pathways influenced by curcumin.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cytokine production and inflammation drive autophagy in the tumor microenvironment: role of stromal caveolin-1 as a key regulator.Recently  we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer onset and progression. In this model  cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent fibroblasts. This  in turn  results in the onset of stromal autophagy  which produces recycled nutrients to "feed" anabolic cancer cells. However  it remains unknown how autophagy in the tumor microenvironment relates to inflammation  another key driver of tumorigenesis. To address this issue  here we employed a well-characterized co-culture system in which cancer cells induce autophagy in adjacent fibroblasts via oxidative stress and NFκB-activation. We show  using this co-culture system  that the same experimental conditions that result in an autophagic microenvironment  also drive in the production of numerous inflammatory mediators (including IL-6  IL-8  IL-10  MIP1a  IFNg  RANTES (CCL5) and GMCSF). Furthermore  we demonstrate that most of these inflammatory mediators are individually sufficient to directly induce the onset of autophagy in fibroblasts. To further validate the in vivo relevance of these findings  we assessed the inflammatory status of Cav-1 (-/-) null mammary fat pads  which are a model of a bonafide autophagic microenvironment. Notably  we show that Cav-1 (-/-) mammary fat pads undergo infiltration with numerous inflammatory cell types  including lymphocytes  T-cells  macrophages and mast cells. Taken together  our results suggest that cytokine production and inflammation are key drivers of autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. These results may explain why a loss of stromal Cav-1 is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients  as it is a marker of both (1) autophagy and (2) inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Lastly  hypoxia in fibroblasts was not sufficient to induce the full-blown inflammatory response that we observed during the co-culture of fibroblasts with cancer cells  indicating that key reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts may be required.,Autophagy_notLIR
Upregulation of Unc-51-like kinase 1 by nitric oxide stabilizes SIRT1  independent of autophagy.SIRT1 is central to the lifespan and vascular health  but undergoes degradation that contributes to several medical conditions  including diabetes. How SIRT1 turnover is regulated remains unclear. However  emerging evidence suggests that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) positively regulates SIRT1 protein expression. We recently identified NO as an endogenous inhibitor of 26S proteasome functionality with a cellular reporter system. Here we extended this finding to a novel pathway that regulates SIRT1 protein breakdown. In cycloheximide (CHX)-treated endothelial cells  NONOate  an NO donor  and A23187  an eNOS activator  significantly stabilized SIRT1 protein. Similarly  NO enhanced SIRT1 protein  but not mRNA expression  in CHX-free cells. NO also stabilized an autophagy-related protein unc-51 like kinase (ULK1)  but did not restore SIRT1 protein levels in ULK1-siRNA-treated cells or in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from Ulk1-/- mice. This suggests that ULK1 mediated the NO regulation of SIRT1. Furthermore  adenoviral overexpression of ULK1 increased SIRT1 protein expression  while ULK1 siRNA treatment decreased it. Rapamycin-induced autophagy did not mimic these effects  suggesting that the effects of ULK1 were autophagy-independent. Treatment with MG132  a proteasome inhibitor  or siRNA of β-TrCP1  an E3 ligase  prevented SIRT1 reduction induced by ULK1-siRNA. Mechanistically  ULK1 negatively regulated 26S proteasome functionality  which was at least partly mediated by O-linked-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)  probably by increased O-GlcNAc modification of proteasomal subunit Rpt2. The NO-ULK1-SIRT1 axis was likely operative in the whole animal: both ULK1 and SIRT1 protein levels were significantly reduced in tissue homogenates in eNOS-knockout mice (lung) and in db/db mice where eNOS is downregulated (lung and heart). Taken together  the results show that NO stabilizes SIRT1 by regulating 26S proteasome functionality through ULK1 and OGT  but not autophagy  in endothelial cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ischemia Induces Quiescence and Autophagy Dependence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Purpose To characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells surviving ischemia with respect to cell cycle kinetics  chemosensitivity  and molecular dependencies that may be exploited to potentiate treatment with transarterial embolization (TAE). Materials and Methods Animal studies were performed according to institutionally approved protocols. The growth kinetics of HCC cells were studied in standard and ischemic conditions. Viability and cell cycle kinetics were measured by using flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity profiling was performed by using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas HCC RNA-sequencing data were performed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Activation of molecular mediators of autophagy was measured with Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. In vivo TAE was performed in a rat model of HCC with (n = 5) and without (n = 5) the autophagy inhibitor Lys05. Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad software. Results HCC cells survived ischemia with an up to 43% increase in the fraction of quiescent cells as compared with cells grown in standard conditions (P < .004). Neither doxorubicin nor mitomycin C potentiated the cytotoxic effects of ischemia. Gene-set analysis revealed an increase in mRNA expression of the mediators of autophagy (eg  CDKN2A  PPP2R2C  and TRAF2) in HCC as compared with normal liver. Cells surviving ischemia were autophagy dependent. Combination therapy coupling autophagy inhibition and TAE in a rat model of HCC resulted in a 21% increase in tumor necrosis compared with TAE alone (P = .044). Conclusion Ischemia induces quiescence in surviving HCC cells  resulting in a dependence on autophagy  providing a potential therapeutic target for combination therapy with TAE. <sup>©</sup> RSNA  2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.,Autophagy_notLIR
Deciphering the Molecular Signals of PINK1/Parkin Mitophagy.Functional mitochondria are critically important for the maintenance of cellular integrity and survival. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Two gene products mutated in familial Parkinsonism  PINK1 and Parkin  function together to degrade damaged mitochondria through a selective form of autophagy termed mitophagy. PINK1 accumulates on the surface of dysfunctional mitochondria where it simultaneously recruits and activates Parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This forms the basis of multiple signaling events that culminate in engulfment of damaged mitochondria within autophagosomes and degradation by lysosomes. This review discusses the molecular signals of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and the ubiquitin code that drives not only Parkin recruitment and activation by PINK1 but also the downstream signaling events of mitophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
How to get rid of mitochondria: crosstalk and regulation of multiple mitophagy pathways.Mitochondria are indispensable cellular organelles providing ATP and numerous other essential metabolites to ensure cell survival. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)  which are formed as side reactions during oxidative phosphorylation or by external agents  induce molecular damage in mitochondrial proteins  lipids/membranes and DNA. To cope with this and other sorts of organellar stress  a multi-level quality control system exists to maintain cellular homeostasis. One critical level of mitochondrial quality control is the removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. This process utilizes parts of the general autophagy machinery  e.g. for the formation of autophagosomes but also employs mitophagy-specific factors. Depending on the proteins utilized mitophagy is divided into receptor-mediated and ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy. So far  at least seven receptor proteins are known to be required for mitophagy under different experimental conditions. In contrast to receptor-mediated pathways  the Pink-Parkin-dependent pathway is currently the best characterized ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Recently two additional ubiquitin-mediated pathways with distinctive similarities and differences were unraveled. We will summarize the current state of knowledge about these multiple pathways  explain their mechanism  and describe the regulation and crosstalk between these pathways. Finally  we will review recent evidence for the evolutionary conservation of ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Metformin and pancreatic cancer: Is there a role?Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA  with a 5-year survival rate of 6 %. Anti-hyperglycemic treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus that induce hyperinsulinemia (i.e.  sulfonylureas) are thought to increase cancer risk  whereas treatments that lower insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (i.e.  metformin) are considered cancer prevention strategies. Metformin is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. Retrospective studies have shown a survival benefit in diabetic patients with many solid tumors including pancreatic cancer that have been treated with metformin compared with patients treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Metformin influences various cellular pathways  including activation of the LKB1/AMPK pathway  inhibition of cell division  promotion of apoptosis and autophagy  down-regulation of circulating insulin  and activation of the immune system. Ongoing research is redefining our understanding about how metformin modulates the molecular pathways implicated in pancreatic cancer. The authors review the topic critically and also give their opinion. Further studies investigating the effect of metformin in combination with chemotherapy  targeted agents  or radiation therapy are undergoing. In addition  the role of metabolic and other biomarkers is needed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ethanol represses the expression of methanol-inducible genes via acetyl-CoA synthesis in the yeast Komagataella phaffii.In methylotrophic yeasts  the expression of methanol-inducible genes is repressed by ethanol even in the presence of methanol  a phenomenon called ethanol repression. The mechanism of ethanol repression in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) was studied  and acetyl-CoA synthesis from ethanol by sequential reactions of alcohol dehydrogenase  aldehyde dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) was involved in ethanol repression. Molecular analysis of the ACS-encoding gene product KpAcs1 revealed that its N-terminal motif  which is conserved in methylotrophic yeasts  was required for ethanol repression. ACS activity was downregulated during methanol-induced gene expression  which partially depended on autophagy. In addition  acetyl-CoA synthesis and phosphorylation of a transcription factor KpMxr1 were found to contribute to ethanol repression in a synergistic manner.,Autophagy_notLIR
Attenuating Spinal Cord Injury by Conditioned Medium from Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition and might even result in death. However  current treatments are not sufficient to repair such damage. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) are ideal transplantable cells which have been shown to modulate the injury cascade of SCI mostly through paracrine effects. The present study investigates whether systemic administration of conditioned medium from MSCs (MSCcm) has the potential to be efficacious as an alternative to cell-based therapy for SCI. In neuron-glial cultures  MSC coculture effectively promoted neuronal connection and reduced oxygen glucose deprivation-induced cell damage. The protection was elicited even if neuron-glial culture was used to expose MSCcm  suggesting the effects possibly from released fractions of MSC. In vivo  intravenous administration of MSCcm to SCI rats significantly improved behavioral recovery from spinal cord injury  and there were increased densities of axons in the lesion site of MSCcm-treated rats compared to SCI rats. At early days postinjury  MSCcm treatment upregulated the protein levels of Olig 2 and HSP70 and also increased autophage-related proteins in the injured spinal cords. Together  these findings suggest that MSCcm treatment promotes spinal cord repair and functional recovery  possibly via activation of autophagy and enhancement of survival-related proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Differentiation-Dependent Energy Production and Metabolite Utilization: A Comparative Study on Neural Stem Cells  Neurons  and Astrocytes.While it is evident that the metabolic machinery of stem cells should be fairly different from that of differentiated neurons  the basic energy production pathways in neural stem cells (NSCs) or in neurons are far from clear. Using the model of in vitro neuron production by NE-4C NSCs  this study focused on the metabolic changes taking place during the in vitro neuronal differentiation. O2 consumption  H(+) production  and metabolic responses to single metabolites were measured in cultures of NSCs and in their neuronal derivatives  as well as in primary neuronal and astroglial cultures. In metabolite-free solutions  NSCs consumed little O2 and displayed a higher level of mitochondrial proton leak than neurons. In stem cells  glycolysis was the main source of energy for the survival of a 2.5-h period of metabolite deprivation. In contrast  stem cell-derived or primary neurons sustained a high-level oxidative phosphorylation during metabolite deprivation  indicating the consumption of own cellular material for energy production. The stem cells increased O2 consumption and mitochondrial ATP production in response to single metabolites (with the exception of glucose)  showing rapid adaptation of the metabolic machinery to the available resources. In contrast  single metabolites did not increase the O2 consumption of neurons or astrocytes. In "starving" neurons  neither lactate nor pyruvate was utilized for mitochondrial ATP production. Gene expression studies also suggested that aerobic glycolysis and rapid metabolic adaptation characterize the NE-4C NSCs  while autophagy and alternative glucose utilization play important roles in the metabolism of stem cell-derived neurons.,Autophagy_notLIR
Imiquimod inhibits the growth of SGC‑7901 cells in vitro through induction of autophagy and apoptosis.Imiquimod  the most prominent Toll‑like receptor 7 agonist  has direct anti‑tumor activity and can induce autophagy and apoptosis in various types of human cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the anti‑tumor effects of imiquimod and their underlying mechanisms in SGC‑7901 cells. Imiquimod exerted an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner as indicated by an MTT assay. Imiquimod induced autophagy as well as apoptosis  while simultaneous treatment with 3‑methyladenine (3-MA)  an autophagy inhibitor  decreased the toxicity of imiquimod. Furthermore  blocking of autophagy by 3‑MA exerted an inhibitory effect on imiquimod-induced apoptosis  which indicated that autophagy can function as a mechanism which  upon activation  directly leads to apoptosis and cell death of SGC‑7901 cells. The results of the present study suggested that imiquimod has potent direct activity against gastric cancer cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy deficient keratinocytes display increased DNA damage  senescence and aberrant lipid composition after oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.Autophagy allows cells fundamental adaptations to metabolic needs and to stress. Using autophagic bulk degradation cells can clear crosslinked macromolecules and damaged organelles that arise under redox stress. Accumulation of such debris results in cellular dysfunction and is observed in aged tissue and senescent cells. Conversely  promising anti-aging strategies aim at inhibiting the mTOR pathway and thereby activating autophagy  to counteract aging associated damage. We have inactivated autophagy related 7 (Atg7)  an essential autophagy gene  in murine keratinocytes (KC) and have found in an earlier study that this resulted in increased baseline oxidative stress and reduced capacity to degrade crosslinked proteins after oxidative ultraviolet stress. To investigate whether autophagy deficiency would promote cellular aging  we studied how Atg7 deficient (KO) and Atg7 bearing cells (WT) would respond to stress induced by paraquat (PQ)  an oxidant drug commonly used to induce cellular senescence. Atg7 deficient KC displayed increased prostanoid signaling and a pro- mitotic gene expression signature as compared to the WT. After exposure to PQ  both WT and KO cells showed an inflammatory and stress-related transcriptomic response. However  the Atg7 deficient cells additionally showed drastic DNA damage- and cell cycle arrest signaling. Indeed  DNA fragmentation and -oxidation were strongly increased in the stressed Atg7 deficient cells upon PQ stress but also after oxidizing ultraviolet A irradiation. Damage associated phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) foci were increased in the nuclei  whereas expression of the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1 was strongly decreased. Similarly  in both  PQ treated mouse tail skin explants and in UVA irradiated mouse tail skin  we found a strong increase in γH2AX positive nuclei within the basal layer of Atg7 deficient epidermis. Atg7 deficiency significantly affected expression of lipid metabolic genes. Therefore we performed lipid profiling of keratinocytes which demonstrated a major dysregulation of cellular lipid metabolism. We found accumulation of autophagy agonisitic free fatty acids  whereas triglyceride levels were strongly decreased. Together  our data show that in absence of Atg7/autophagy the resistance of keratinocytes to intrinsic and environmental oxidative stress was severely impaired and resulted in DNA damage  cell cycle arrest and a disturbed lipid phenotype  all typical for premature cell aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
FUNDC1 is a novel mitochondrial-associated-membrane (MAM) protein required for hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy.Mitochondria need to be fragmented prior to engulfment by phagophores  the precursors to autophagosomes. However  how these 2 processes are finely regulated and integrated is poorly understood. We have shown that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein FUNDC1 is a novel mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) protein  enriched at the MAM by interacting with the ER resident protein CANX (calnexin) under hypoxia. As mitophagy proceeds  it dissociates from CANX and preferably recruits DNM1L/DRP1 to drive mitochondrial fission in response to hypoxic stress. In addition  knocking down of FUNDC1  DNM1L or CANX in hypoxic cells increases the number of elongated mitochondria and also reduces the colocalization of autophagosome and mitochondria  thus preventing mitophagy. These findings identify FUNDC1 as a molecular hub integrating mitochondrial fission and mitophagy at the MAM in response to hypoxia.,Autophagy_notLIR
miRNAs in immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most fatal infectious diseases  affecting one third of the world's population. The causative agent  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)  has a well-established ability to circumvent the host's immune system for its long-term intracellular survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial post-transcriptional regulators of immune response. They act by negatively regulating the expression levels of important genes in both innate and adaptive immunity. It has been established in recent studies that the host immune response against Mtb is regulated by many miRNAs  most of which are induced by Mtb infection. Moreover  differential expression of miRNA in tuberculosis (TB) patients may help distinguish between TB patients and healthy individuals or latent TB. In this review  we present the recent advancements on the miRNA regulation of the host responses against Mtb infection  as well as the potential of miRNAs to as biomarkers for TB diagnosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Traditional Chinese Medicine CFF-1 induced cell growth inhibition  autophagy  and apoptosis via inhibiting EGFR-related pathways in prostate cancer.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a combined therapeutic result in cancer treatment by integrating holistic and local therapeutical effects  by which TCM can enhance the curative effect and reduce the side effect. In this study  we analyzed the effect of CFF-1 (alcohol extract from an anticancer compound Chinese medicine) on prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and studied in detail the mechanism of cell death induced by CFF-1 in vitro and in vivo. From our data  we found for the first time that CFF-1 obviously arrested cell cycle in G1 phase  decreased cell viability and then increased nuclear rupture in a dose-dependent manner and finally resulted in apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In molecular level  our data showed that CFF-1 induced inhibition of EGFR auto-phosphorylation and inactivation of EGFR. Disruption of EGFR activity in turn suppressed downstream PI3K/AKT and Raf/Erk signal pathways  resulted in the decrease of p-FOXO1 (Ser256) and regulated the expression of apoptosis-related and cycle-related genes. Moreover  CFF-1 markedly induced cell autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and then up-regulating Beclin-1 and LC-3II and down-regulating phosphorylation of p70S6K. In vivo  CFF-1-treated group exhibited a significant decrease in tumor volume compared with the negative control group in subcutaneous xenograft tumor in nude mice via inhibiting EGFR-related signal pathways. Thus  bio-functions of Chinese medicine CFF-1 in inducing PCa cell growth inhibition  autophagy  and apoptosis suggested that CFF-1 had the clinical potential to treat patients with prostate cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuroprotection of Catalpol for Experimental Acute Focal Ischemic Stroke: Preclinical Evidence and Possible Mechanisms of Antioxidation  Anti-Inflammation  and Antiapoptosis.Neuroprotection is defined as using a therapy that affects the brain tissue in the still-viable ischemic penumbra to salvage or delay the infarction. Catalpol  the main active principle of the root of Radix Rehmanniae  was reported to have pleiotropic neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases including ischemic stroke. Here  we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of catalpol in experimental acute ischemic stroke. Studies on catalpol in animal models of acute ischemic stroke were identified from 6 databases. Twenty-five studies involving 805 animals were included. Twelve comparisons showed significant effects of catalpol on decreasing infarct size according to 2 3 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining compared with the control (<i>P</i> < 0.05). One study reported significant effect of catalpol on reducing infarct size according to magnetic resonance imaging scan compared with the control (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Meta-analysis of these studies indicated that catalpol significantly improved the neurological function score according to Zea Longa score  Bederson score  balance beam-walking test  adhesive removal test  bar-grasping score  and corner test compared with the control (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In conclusion  catalpol exerted neuroprotective effects for experimental acute focal ischemic stroke  largely through reducing oxidative reactions  inhibiting apoptosis  and repressing inflammatory reactions and autophagy. However  these apparently positive findings should be interpreted with caution because of the methodological flaws.,Autophagy_notLIR

This study was designed to explore whether PAH prevents gastric cancer growth and to investigate the molecular mechanism.,Autophagy_notLIR
BRG1 and BRM SWI/SNF ATPases redundantly maintain cardiomyocyte homeostasis by regulating cardiomyocyte mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in vivo.There has been an increasing recognition that mitochondrial perturbations play a central role in human heart failure. Mitochondrial networks  whose function is to maintain the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis  autophagy ('mitophagy') and mitochondrial fusion/fission  are new potential therapeutic targets. Yet our understanding of the molecular underpinning of these processes is just emerging. We recently identified a role of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in the metabolic homeostasis of the adult cardiomyocyte using cardiomyocyte-specific and inducible deletion of the SWI/SNF ATPases BRG1 and BRM in adult mice (Brg1/Brm double mutant mice). To build upon these observations in early altered metabolism  the present study looks at the subsequent alterations in mitochondrial quality control mechanisms in the impaired adult cardiomyocyte. We identified that Brg1/Brm double-mutant mice exhibited increased mitochondrial biogenesis  increases in 'mitophagy'  and alterations in mitochondrial fission and fusion that led to small  fragmented mitochondria. Mechanistically  increases in the autophagy and mitophagy-regulated proteins Beclin1 and Bnip3 were identified  paralleling changes seen in human heart failure. Evidence for perturbed cardiac mitochondrial dynamics included decreased mitochondria size  reduced numbers of mitochondria  and an altered expression of genes regulating fusion (Mfn1  Opa1) and fission (Drp1). We also identified cardiac protein amyloid accumulation (aggregated fibrils) during disease progression along with an increase in pre-amyloid oligomers and an upregulated unfolded protein response including increased GRP78  CHOP  and IRE-1 signaling. Together  these findings described a role for BRG1 and BRM in mitochondrial quality control  by regulating mitochondrial number  mitophagy  and mitochondrial dynamics not previously recognized in the adult cardiomyocyte. As critical to the pathogenesis of heart failure  epigenetic mechanisms like SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling seem more intimately linked to cardiac function and mitochondrial quality control mechanisms than previously realized.,Autophagy_notLIR
8-Nitro-cGMP: A Novel Protein-Reactive cNMP and Its Emerging Roles in Autophagy.Nitric oxide (NO) raises the intracellular 3' 5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and  in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)  reacts with biomolecules to produce nitrated cGMP derivatives. 8-Nitro-cGMP was the first endogenous cGMP derivative discovered in mammalian cells (2007) and was later found in plant cells. Among the six nitrogen atoms in this molecule  the one in the nitro group (NO<sub>2</sub>) comes from NO. This chapter asserts that this newly found cGMP is undoubtedly one of the major physiological cNMPs. Multiple studies suggest that its intracellular abundance might exceed that of unmodified cGMP. The characteristic chemical feature of 8-nitro-cGMP is its ability to modify proteinous cysteine residues via a stable sulfide bond. In this posttranslational modification  the nitro group is detached from the guanine base. This modification  termed "protein S-guanylation " is known to regulate the physiological functions of several important proteins. Furthermore  8-nitro-cGMP participates in the regulation of autophagy. For example  in antibacterial autophagy (xenophagy)  S-guanylation accumulates around invading bacterial cells and functions as a "tag" for subsequent clearance of the organism via ubiquitin modifications. This finding suggests the existence of a system for recognizing the cGMP structure on proteins. Autophagy induction by 8-nitro-cGMP is mechanistically distinct from the well-described starvation-induced autophagy and is independent of the action of mTOR  the master regulator of canonical autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Insights into the involvement of noncoding RNAs in 5-fluorouracil drug resistance.5-Fluorouracil is a classic chemotherapeutic drug that is widely used to treat various cancers. However  patients often exhibit primary or acquired drug resistance during treatment with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. 5-Fluorouracil resistance is a multifactorial event that involves abnormal enzyme metabolism  transport deregulation  cell cycle disorders  apoptosis resistance  and mismatch repair deficiency. Despite advancements in bioresearch technologies in the past several decades  the molecular mechanisms of 5-fluorouracil resistance have not been completely clarified. Recently  microarray analyses have shown that noncoding RNAs (i.e. microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs) play a vital role in 5-fluorouracil resistance in multiple cancer cell lines. These noncoding RNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors  contributing to 5-fluorouracil drug resistance. In this review  we discuss the effects of microRNAs on 5-fluorouracil sensitivity via targeting of metabolic enzymes  the cell cycle  apoptosis  autophagy  the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  and cancer stem cells. In particular  we focus on summarizing current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which long noncoding RNAs mediate 5-fluorouracil drug resistance. Moreover  we describe the specific microRNAs that may function as markers for prediction of chemotherapeutic response to 5-fluorouracil. This review will help to improve the current understanding of how to reverse 5-fluorouracil resistance and may facilitate the establishment of new strategies for alleviating drug resistance in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
MicroRNA-7 facilitates the degradation of alpha-synuclein and its aggregates by promoting autophagy.Alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) is an important protein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) as it accumulates as fibrillar inclusions in affected brain regions including dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Elevated levels of α-Syn seem to be crucial in mediating its toxicity. Thus  detailed information regarding the regulatory mechanism of α-Syn expression in several layers such as transcription  post-transcription and post-translation is needed in order to devise therapeutic interventions for PD. Previously  we reported that expression of α-Syn is repressed by microRNA-7 (miR-7) through its effect on the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of α-Syn mRNA. Here  we show that miR-7 also accelerates the clearance of α-Syn and its aggregates by promoting autophagy in differentiated ReNcell VM cells. Further  miR-7 facilitates the degradation of pre-formed fibrils of α-Syn transported from outside the cells. This additional mechanism for reducing α-Syn levels show miR-7 to be an important molecular target for PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR

Inducing mitophagy in diabetic platelets protects against severe oxidative stress.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing international concern. Considerable mortality and morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus arise predominantly from thrombotic cardiovascular events. Oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial damage contributes significantly to enhanced thrombosis in DM A basal autophagy process has recently been described as playing an important role in normal platelet activation. We now report a substantial mitophagy induction (above basal autophagy levels) in diabetic platelets  suggesting alternative roles for autophagy in platelet pathology. Using a combination of molecular  biochemical  and imaging studies on human DM platelets  we report that platelet mitophagy induction serves as a platelet protective mechanism that responds to oxidative stress through JNK activation. By removing damaged mitochondria (mitophagy)  phosphorylated p53 is reduced  preventing progression to apoptosis  and preserving platelet function. The absence of mitophagy in DM platelets results in failure to protect against oxidative stress  leading to increased thrombosis. Surprisingly  this removal of damaged mitochondria does not require contributions from transcription  as platelets lack a nucleus. The considerable energy and resources expended in "prepackaging" the complex mitophagy machinery in a short-lived normal platelet support a critical role  in anticipation of exposure to oxidative stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of p62/SQSTM1 in sporadic inclusion body myositis.We examined selective autophagy against ubiquitinated protein aggregates in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) patients. The form of autophagy requires phosphorylation of serine 403 in p62/SQSTM1 to bind to Lys63-linked ubiquitin and the binding of the p62-ubiquitinated protein conjugates to LC3. In muscle biopsy specimens from 16 s-IBM patients  we compared the distribution of p62 (aa120-440) with 1) Ser403-phosphorylated p62 (S403-pp62)  2) Lys63-linked ubiquitin and 3) LC3 in double-colour immunofluorescence microscopy. S403-pp62  Lys63-linked ubiquitin and LC3 colocalised with p62 aggregates  79.05% ± 13.64% (mean ± SD)  66.54% ± 19.91% and 51.84% ± 14.1%  respectively. Although positive deposits of S403-pp62 and Lys63-linked ubiquitin were always observed within p62 aggregates  LC3 often showed dissociated distribution from p62. We also found fibres containing small  numerous p62-positive dots that were negative for all three markers and were also observed in myositis controls. The results indicate that p62  Lys63-linked ubiquitin and LC3 in s-IBM join to perform selective autophagy. p62 could be induced by some cellular stresses in all types of myositis; however  in s-IBM  compromised binding of the p62-ubiquitinated protein complex to LC3 could stop the autophagy process in its initial stages  which causes the formation of aggregates of p62-oligomers with Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of HSP27 downregulation on PDT resistance through PDT-induced autophagy in head and neck cancer cells.We previously reported that photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces cell death in head and neck cancer through both autophagy and apoptosis. Regulation of cell death by autophagy and apoptosis is important to enhance the effects of PDT. Autophagy maintains a balance between cell death and PDT resistance. Downregulation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induces PDT resistance in head and neck cancer cells. Furthermore  HSP70 regulates apoptosis during oxidative stress. However  the role of HSPs in PDT-induced cell death through autophagy and apoptosis is unclear. Therefore  in the present study  we investigated the effects of HSP27 and HSP70 on PDT-induced cell death of oral cancer cells through autophagy and apoptosis. Cancer cells were treated with hematoporphyrin at varying doses  followed by irradiation at 635 nm with an energy density of 5 mW/cm2. We determined the changes in HSP expression by determining the levels of PARP-1 and LC3II in PDT-resistant cells. Furthermore  we assessed cell death signaling after downregulating HSPs by transfecting specific siRNAs. We observed that PDT decreased HSP27 expression but increased HSP70 expression in the head and neck cancer cells. Treatment of cells with LC3II and PARP-1 inhibitors resulted in upregulation of HSP70 and HSP27 expression  respectively. Downregulation of HSP27 and HSP70 induced cell death and PDT resistance through autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover  downregulation of HSP27 in PDT-resistant cells resulted in enhanced survival. These results indicate that the regulation of HSP27 and HSP70 plays a principal role in increasing the effects of PDT by inducing autophagic and apoptotic cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanisms of redox metabolism and cancer cell survival during extracellular matrix detachment.Nontransformed cells that become detached from the extracellular matrix (ECM) undergo dysregulation of redox homeostasis and cell death. In contrast  cancer cells often acquire the ability to mitigate programmed cell death pathways and recalibrate the redox balance to survive after ECM detachment  facilitating metastatic dissemination. Accordingly  recent studies of the mechanisms by which cancer cells overcome ECM detachment-induced metabolic alterations have focused on mechanisms in redox homeostasis. The insights into these mechanisms may inform the development of therapeutics that manipulate redox homeostasis to eliminate ECM-detached cancer cells. Here  we review how ECM-detached cancer cells balance redox metabolism for survival.,Autophagy_notLIR
Maresin 1 inhibits TNF-alpha-induced lipolysis and autophagy in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Obesity is associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)  which promotes inflammation in adipose tissue. The omega-3 PUFAs  and their derived lipid mediators  such as Maresin 1 (MaR1) have anti-inflammatory effects on adipose tissue. This study aimed to analyze if MaR1 may counteract alterations induced by TNF-α on lipolysis and autophagy in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our data revealed that MaR1 (1-100 nM) inhibited the TNF-α-induced glycerol release after 48 hr  which may be related to MaR1 ability of preventing the decrease in lipid droplet-coating protein perilipin and G0/G1 Switch 2 protein expression. MaR1 also reversed the decrease in total hormone sensitive lipase (total HSL)  and the ratio of phosphoHSL at Ser-565/total HSL  while preventing the increased ratio of phosphoHSL at Ser-660/total HSL and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 induced by TNF-α. Moreover  MaR1 counteracted the cytokine-induced decrease of p62 protein  a key autophagy indicator  and also prevented the induction of LC3II/LC3I  an important autophagosome formation marker. Current data suggest that MaR1 may ameliorate TNF-α-induced alterations on lipolysis and autophagy in adipocytes. This may also contribute to the beneficial actions of MaR1 on adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity in obesity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Alisertib promotes apoptosis and autophagy in melanoma through p38 MAPK-mediated aurora a signaling.We investigated the efficacy of Alisertib (ALS)  a selective Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor  in melanoma. We found that ALS exerts anti-proliferative  pro-apoptotic  and pro-autophagic effects on A375 and skmel-5 melanoma cells by inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling. SB202190  a p38 MAPK-selective inhibitor  enhanced ALS-induced apoptosis and autophagy in both cell lines. ALS induced cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells through activation of the p53/p21/cyclin B1 pathway. Knockdown of p38 MAPK enhanced ALS-induced apoptosis and reduced ALS-induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy sensitized melanoma cells to ALS-induced apoptosis. These data indicate ALS is a potential therapeutic agent for melanoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Iron citrate reduces high phosphate-induced vascular calcification by inhibiting apoptosis.High phosphate-induced vascular calcification (VC) and iron deficiency-induced anemia are two major contributors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD).

A new chemotherapeutic approach using doxorubicin simultaneously with geopropolis favoring monocyte functions.Chemotherapy has been widely used to treat cancer although it may affect non-target cells involved in the immune response.

Synthesis  antitumor activity and molecular mechanism of doxorubicin conjugated trimethyl-chitosan polymeric micelle loading Beclin1 siRNA for drug-resisted bladder cancer therapy.Herein  we describe a convenient approach for the preparation of a polymeric micelle using doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated trimethyl-chitosan (TMC) with Beclin-1 siRNA (Si-Beclin1/DOX-TMC). This micelle displayed a potent capacity for autophagy inhibition and reversed drug-resistance to DOX in BIU-87/ADR cell lines. The Si-Beclin1/DOX-TMC micelle was highly cytotoxic to both drug-sensitive BIU-87 and drug-resistant BIU-87/ADR cells. Its capacity to reverse drug-resistance was dependent upon upregulation of autophagy levels in BIU-87/ADR cells. DOX was conjugated to TMC <i>via</i> a pH-sensitive Schiff base  which responded to the acidic lysosome microenvironment and resulted in the cytoplasmic release of DOX. The structure of DOX conjugation to the TMC polymeric micelle was characterized by NMR  GPC  TEM and DLS. DOX release profiles in different pH environment were determined by HPLC. Cellular uptake  changes to nuclei morphology and formation of autophagosomes were observed using a fluorescence microscope. Finally  <i>in vivo</i> antitumor activity of systemic Si-Beclin1/DOX-TMC micelle administration was evaluated in BIU-87/ADR xenograft models and Si-Beclin1/DOX-TMC micelles showed significantly suppressed tumor growth.,Autophagy_notLIR
PTK2-mediated degradation of ATG3 impedes cancer cells susceptible to DNA damage treatment.ATG3 (autophagy-related 3) is an E2-like enzyme essential for autophagy; however  it is unknown whether it has an autophagy-independent function. Here  we report that ATG3 is a relatively stable protein in unstressed cells  but it is degraded in response to DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide or cisplatin. With mass spectrometry and a mutagenesis assay  phosphorylation of tyrosine 203 of ATG3 was identified to be a critical modification for its degradation  which was further confirmed by manipulating ATG3<sup>Y203E</sup> (phosphorylation mimic) or ATG3<sup>Y203F</sup> (phosphorylation-incompetent) in Atg3 knockout MEFs. In addition  by using a generated phospho-specific antibody we showed that phosphorylation of Y203 significantly increased upon etoposide treatment. With a specific inhibitor or siRNA  PTK2 (protein tyrosine kinase 2) was confirmed to catalyze the phosphorylation of ATG3 at Y203. Furthermore  a newly identified function of ATG3 was recognized to be associated with the promotion of DNA damage-induced mitotic catastrophe  in which ATG3 interferes with the function of BAG3  a crucial protein in the mitotic process  by binding. Finally  PTK2 inhibition-induced sustained levels of ATG3 were able to sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents. Our findings strengthen the notion that targeting PTK2 in combination with DNA-damaging agents is a novel strategy for cancer therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Atg9b Deficiency Suppresses Autophagy and Potentiates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Associated Hepatocyte Apoptosis in Hepatocarcinogenesis.The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying autophagy deficiency during hepatic carcinogenesis. For this purpose  we used choline-deficient  amino acid-defined (CDAA) hepatocarcinogenesis model in mice. miRNA microarrays combined with computational target predictions and GO analysis were used to identify molecular processes involved in carcinogenesis. PCR profiler array was employed to detect the dysregulated autophagy-related genes during carcinogenesis. We observed induction of hepatic tumours with increased inflammation  DNA damage  and cell death. These cellular processes were particularly detected upon oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes in which ER stress was excessively induced. Microarray combined with GO analysis showed that transformation of hepatocytes resulted in dysregulated events associated with cytoplasmic vesicle formation  which  in turn  was related to ER stress-induced autophagy. Defects of autophagy were observed in livers harbouring tumours and suffered a loss of expression of autophagy-related protein 9b (Atg9b). Hepatocytes lacking Atg9b were vulnerable to cell death induced by ER stress stimulus mainly caused by accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Loss of Atg9b also blocked recruitment of p62-associated ubiquitinated protein for autophagosome-lysosome degradation as Atg9b-driven phagophores may facilitate docking of both LC3 and p62 to initiate autophagy-associated degradation. miR-3091-3p from tumour-derived exosomes  which were internalised by hepatocytes  could suppress Atg9b expression. Observations from this study advance our knowledge about the regulation of autophagy during hepatocarcinogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
CHOP Contributes to  But Is Not the Only Mediator of  IAPP Induced β-Cell Apoptosis.The islet in type 2 diabetes is characterized by β-cell loss  increased β-cell apoptosis  and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). When protein misfolding protective mechanisms are overcome  human IAPP (h-IAPP) forms membrane permeant toxic oligomers that induce β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. In humans with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and mice transgenic for h-IAPP  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been inferred from nuclear translocation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)  an established mediator of ER stress. To establish whether h-IAPP toxicity is mediated by ER stress  we evaluated diabetes onset and β-cell mass in h-IAPP transgenic (h-TG) mice with and without deletion of CHOP in comparison with wild-type controls. Diabetes was delayed in h-TG CHOP(-/-) mice  with relatively preserved β-cell mass and decreased β-cell apoptosis. Deletion of CHOP attenuates dysfunction of the autophagy/lysosomal pathway in β-cells of h-TG mice  uncovering a role for CHOP in mediating h-IAPP-induced dysfunction of autophagy. As deletion of CHOP delayed but did not prevent h-IAPP-induced β-cell loss and diabetes  we examined CHOP-independent stress pathways. JNK  a target of the IRE-1pTRAF2 complex  and the Bcl-2 family proapoptotic mediator BIM  a target of ATF4  were comparably activated by h-IAPP expression in the presence and absence of CHOP. Therefore  although these studies affirm that CHOP is a mediator of h-IAPP-induced ER stress  it is not the only one. Therefore  suppression of CHOP alone is unlikely to be a durable therapeutic strategy to protect against h-IAPP toxicity because multiple stress pathways are activated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Protein aggregates and proteostasis in aging: Amylin and β-cell function.The ubiquitin-proteasomal-system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosomal-system (ALS) are both highly susceptible for disturbances leading to the accumulation of cellular damage. A decline of protein degradation during aging results in the formation of oxidatively damaged and aggregated proteins finally resulting in failure of cellular functionality. Besides protein aggregation in response to oxidative damage  amyloids are a different type of protein aggregates able to distract proteostasis and interfere with cellular functionality. Amyloids are clearly linked to the pathogenesis of age-related degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Human amylin is one of the peptides forming fibrils in β-sheet conformation finally leading to amyloid formation. In contrast to rodent amylin  human amylin is prone to form amyloidogenic aggregates  proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes by impairing β-cell functionality. Since aggregates such as lipofuscin and β-amyloid are known to impair proteostasis  it is likely to assume similar effects for human amylin. In this review  we focus on the effects of IAPP on UPS and ALS and their role in amylin degradation  since both systems play a crucial role in maintaining proteome balance thereby influencing  at least in part  cellular fate and aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Weicao capsule ameliorates renal injury through increasing autophagy and NLRP3 degradation in UAN rats.Uric acid nephropathy (UAN) is one of the most common metabolic diseases and leads to kidney damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Weicao capsule on renal injury of UAN rats and to examine whether the mechanism was associated with induction of autophagy and degradation of nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptor (NLR) protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 6 groups: Control  Model  Allopurinol  and Weicao (0.55/1.1/2.2 g/kg) group. The data showed activation of renal NLRP3 inflammasome in UAN rats  with elevation in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18  and subsequent deterioration of renal injury. Fortunately  Weicao had a markedly therapeutic effect on UAN rats  including improving renal function-related indexes  ameliorating hyperuricemia-related inflammation  decreasing crystals in renal tissue and alleviating renal interstitial fibrosis. Additionally  Weicao exerted anti-proliferative and anti-apoptosis effects on rat renal tubular epithelial cell NRK-52E in macrophages from UAN rats. Our investigation into the mechanism revealed that Weicao suppressed the activated NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore  Weicao induced autophagy  as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in levels of renal autophagy-related proteins in UAN rats. Moreover  autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and NLRP3 activator ATP blocked the effect of Weicao on autophagy induction and NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. In conclusion  Weicao had similar effects as allopurinol and exerted anti-inflammatory and renal-protective effect in a concentration-dependent manner in UAN rats  most likely through increasing autophagy and NLRP3 degradation. Our study provides new insight into the underlying mechanism of Weicao in the treatment of UAN.,Autophagy_notLIR
Host-Microbe Co-metabolism Dictates Cancer Drug Efficacy in C. elegans.Fluoropyrimidines are the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer  but their efficacy is highly variable between patients. We queried whether gut microbes  a known source of inter-individual variability  impacted drug efficacy. Combining two tractable genetic models  the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans  we performed three-way high-throughput screens that unraveled the complexity underlying host-microbe-drug interactions. We report that microbes can bolster or suppress the effects of fluoropyrimidines through metabolic drug interconversion involving bacterial vitamin B<sub>6</sub>  B<sub>9</sub>  and ribonucleotide metabolism. Also  disturbances in bacterial deoxynucleotide pools amplify 5-FU-induced autophagy and cell death in host cells  an effect regulated by the nucleoside diphosphate kinase ndk-1. Our data suggest a two-way bacterial mediation of fluoropyrimidine effects on host metabolism  which contributes to drug efficacy. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic power of manipulating intestinal microbiota to ensure host metabolic health and treat disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of chronic sugar consumption on lipid accumulation and autophagy in the skeletal muscle.In recent years  the increasing consumption of soft drinks containing high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose has caused a rise in fructose intake  which has been related to the epidemic of metabolic diseases.

In the present study  the impact of chronic consumption of glucose or fructose on skeletal muscle of healthy mice was investigated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Melatonin enhances mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis.Liver fibrosis leads to liver cirrhosis and failure  and no effective treatment is currently available. Growing evidence supports a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and liver fibrogenesis and mitochondrial quality control-based therapy has emerged as a new therapeutic target. We investigated the protective mechanisms of melatonin against mitochondrial dysfunction-involved liver fibrosis  focusing on mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) dissolved in olive oil (0.5 mL/kg  twice a week  i.p.) for 8 wk. Melatonin was administered orally at 2.5  5  and 10 mg/kg once a day. Chronic CCl4 exposure induced collagen deposition  hepatocellular damage  and oxidative stress  and melatonin attenuated these increases. Increases in mRNA and protein expression levels of transforming growth factor β1 and α-smooth muscle actin in response to CCl4 were attenuated by melatonin. Melatonin attenuated hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction  such as mitochondrial swelling and glutamate dehydrogenase release. Chronic CCl4 exposure impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis  and melatonin attenuated this impairment  as indicated by increases in mitochondrial DNA and in protein levels of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1); Parkin; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α); nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1); and transcription factor A  mitochondrial (TFAM). CCl4-mediated decreases in mitochondrial fission- and fusion-related proteins  such as dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and mitofusin 2  were also attenuated by melatonin. Moreover  melatonin induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. These results suggest that melatonin protects against liver fibrosis via upregulation of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis  and may be useful as an anti-fibrotic treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptor Is Reduced in -Synuclein Overexpressing Models of Parkinsons Disease.Increasing evidence points to defects in autophagy as a common denominator in most neurodegenerative conditions. Progressive functional decline in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) occurs with age  and the consequent impairment in protein processing capacity has been associated with a higher risk of neurodegeneration. Defects in cathepsin D (CD) processing and α-synuclein degradation causing its accumulation in lysosomes are particularly relevant for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). However  the mechanism by which alterations in CD maturation and α-synuclein degradation leads to autophagy defects in PD neurons is still uncertain. Here we demonstrate that MPR300 shuttling between endosomes and the trans Golgi network is altered in α-synuclein overexpressing neurons. Consequently  CD is not correctly trafficked to lysosomes and cannot be processed to generate its mature active form  leading to a reduced CD-mediated α-synuclein degradation and α-synuclein accumulation in neurons. MPR300 is downregulated in brain from α-synuclein overexpressing animal models and in PD patients with early diagnosis. These data indicate MPR300 as crucial player in the autophagy-lysosomal dysfunctions reported in PD and pinpoint MRP300 as a potential biomarker for PD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sirtuin 6 plays an oncogenic role and induces cell autophagy in esophageal cancer cells.Sirtuin 6  a member of sirtuin family  is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor as it participates in suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and MYC transcription activity by deacetylating H3K9 (histone H3 lysine 9) and H3K56 (histone H3 lysine) at promoters of target genes  leading to the aerobic glycolysis inhibition and cell growth suppression. However  its expression has recently been reported to be highly elevated in a series of tumors  including prostate cancer  breast cancer  and non-small cell lung cancer  indicating that sirtuin 6 plays dual roles in tumorigenicity in a cell/tumor type-specific manner. To our knowledge  the biological roles of sirtuin 6 in esophageal cancer cells have still been underestimated. In the study  data from quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assays and immunohistochemical assays revealed that sirtuin 6 was remarkably overexpressed in esophageal squamous tumor tissues. Moreover  its upregulation was closely related with clinical features  such as gender  pathology  tumor-node-metastasis  and cell differentiation. Subsequently  the biological tests showed that it promoted cell proliferation and induced the expression of Bcl2  a key anti-apoptotic factor  in esophageal carcinoma cells. Moreover  using the ratio of LC3II/I  a widely recognized autophagy biomarker  we showed that it apparently induced cell autophagy  which was further confirmed by the autophagy flux assays. In addition  results from western blotting assays and immunoprecipitation assays displayed that sirtuin 6 specifically interacted with ULK1 and positively regulated its activity by inhibiting its upstream factor mammalian target of rapamycin activity. In summary  our studies shed insights into the crucial functions of sirtuin 6 in esophageal carcinoma cells and provide evidence supporting sirtuin 6-based personalized therapies in esophageal carcinoma cell patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Interplay of Host Autophagy and Eukaryotic Pathogens.For intracellular pathogens  host cells provide a replicative niche  but are also armed with innate defense mechanisms to combat the intruder. Co-evolution of host and pathogens has produced a complex interplay of host-pathogen interactions during infection  with autophagy emerging as a key player in the recent years. Host autophagy as a degradative process is a significant hindrance to intracellular growth of the pathogens  but also can be subverted by the pathogens to provide support such as nutrients. While the role of host cell autophagy in the pathogenesis mechanisms of several bacterial and viral pathogens have been extensively studied  less is known for eukaryotic pathogens. In this review  we focus on the interplay of host autophagy with the eukaryotic pathogens <i>Plasmodium spp  Toxoplasma  Leishmania spp</i> and the fungal pathogens <i>Candida albicans  Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. The differences between these eukaryotic pathogens in terms of the host cell types they infect  infective strategies and the host responses required to defend against them provide an interesting insight into how they respond to and interact with host cell autophagy. Due to the ability to infect multiple host species and cell types during the course of their usually complex lifestyles  autophagy plays divergent roles even for the same pathogen. The scenario is further compounded since many of the eukaryotic pathogens have their own sets of either complete or partial autophagy machinery. Eukaryotic pathogen-autophagy interplay is thus a complex relationship with many novel insights for the basic understanding of autophagy  and potential for clinical relevance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antimalarial Drugs as Immune Modulators: New Mechanisms for Old Drugs.The best known of the naturally occurring antimalarial compounds are quinine  extracted from cinchona bark  and artemisinin (qinghao)  extracted from Artemisia annua in China. These and other derivatives are now chemically synthesized and remain the mainstay of therapy to treat malaria. The beneficial effects of several of the antimalarial drugs (AMDs) on clinical features of autoimmune disorders were discovered by chance during World War II. In this review  we discuss the chemistry of AMDs and their mechanisms of action  emphasizing how they may impact multiple pathways of innate immunity. These pathways include Toll-like receptors and the recently described cGAS-STING pathway. Finally  we discuss the current and future impact of AMDs on systemic lupus erythematosus  rheumatoid arthritis  and devastating monogenic disorders (interferonopathies) characterized by expression of type I interferon in the brain.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oxidative stress  autophagy and airway ion transport.Mucociliary clearance is critically important in protecting the airways from infection and from the harmful effects of smoke and various inspired substances known to induce oxidative stress and persistent inflammation. An essential feature of the clearance mechanism involves regulation of the periciliary liquid layer on the surface of the airway epithelium  which is necessary for normal ciliary beating and maintenance of mucus hydration. The underlying ion transport processes associated with airway surface hydration include epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> absorption occurring in parallel with CFTR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel-dependent anion secretion  which are coordinately regulated to control the depth of the periciliary liquid layer. Oxidative stress is known to cause both acute and chronic effects on airway ion transport function  and an increasing number of studies in the past few years have identified an important role for autophagy as part of the physiological response to the damaging effects of oxidation. In this review  recent studies addressing the influence of oxidative stress and autophagy on airway ion transport pathways  along with results showing the potential of autophagy modulators in restoring the function of ion channels involved in transepithelial electrolyte transport necessary for effective mucociliary clearance  are presented.,Autophagy_notLIR

Reduction of polyethylenimine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles induced autophagy and cytotoxicity by lactosylation.Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles are excellent magnetic resonance contrast agents and surface engineering can expand their applications. When covered with amphiphilic alkyl-polyethyleneimine (PEI)  the modified SPIO nanoparticles can be used as MRI visible gene/drug delivery carriers and cell tracking probes. However  the positively charged amines of PEI can also cause cytotoxicity and restricts their further applications. In this study  we used lactose to modify amphiphilic low molecular weight polyethylenimine (C12-PEI2K) at different lactosylation degree. It was found that the N-alkyl-PEI-lactobionic acid wrapped SPIO nanocomposites show better cell viability without compromising their labelling efficacy as well as MR imaging capability in RAW 264.7 cells  comparing to the unsubstituted ones. Besides  we found the PEI induced cell autophagy can be reduced via lactose modification  indicating the increased cell viability might rely on down-regulating autophagy. Thus  our findings provide a new approach to overcome the toxicity of PEI wrapped SPIO nanocomposites by lactose modification.,Autophagy_notLIR
Modulation of the secretory pathway by amino-acid starvation.As a major anabolic pathway  the secretory pathway needs to adapt to the demands of the surrounding environment and responds to different exogenous signals and stimuli. In this context  the transport in the early secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus appears particularly regulated. For instance  protein export from the ER is critically stimulated by growth factors. Conversely  nutrient starvation also modulates functions of the early secretory pathway in multiple ways. In this review  we focus on amino-acid starvation and how the function of the early secretory pathway is redirected to fuel autophagy  how the ER exit sites are remodeled into novel cytoprotective stress assemblies  and how secretion is modulated in vivo in starving organisms. With the increasingly exciting knowledge on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)  the major nutrient sensor  it is also a good moment to establish how the modulation of the secretory pathway by amino-acid restriction intersects with this major signaling hub.,Autophagy_notLIR
Complement-Mediated Regulation of Metabolism and Basic Cellular Processes.Complement is well appreciated as a critical arm of innate immunity. It is required for the removal of invading pathogens and works by directly destroying them through the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells. However  complement activation and function is not confined to the extracellular space but also occurs within cells. Recent work indicates that complement activation regulates key metabolic pathways and thus can impact fundamental cellular processes  such as survival  proliferation  and autophagy. Newly identified functions of complement include a key role in shaping metabolic reprogramming  which underlies T cell effector differentiation  and a role as a nexus for interactions with other effector systems  in particular the inflammasome and Notch transcription-factor networks. This review focuses on the contributions of complement to basic processes of the cell  in particular the integration of complement with cellular metabolism and the potential implications in infection and other disease settings.,Autophagy_notLIR
Toll-like receptor 7 affects the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Recently  a possible link between toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and liver disease was suggested  although it was limited to fibrosis. Based on this report  we investigated whether TLR7 has a pivotal role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The TLR7 signaling pathway  which is activated by imiquimod (TLR7 ligand) naturally  induced autophagy and released insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) into medium from hepatocytes. Lipid accumulation induced by unsaturated fatty acid (UFA; arachidonic acid:oleic acid = 1:1) in hepatocytes  was attenuated in TLR7 and autophagy activation. Interestingly  TLR7 activation attenuated UFA-induced lipid peroxidation products  such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal (4-HNE). To clarify a possible pathway between TLR7 and lipid peroxidation  we treated hepatocytes with MDA and 4-HNE. MDA and 4-HNE induced 2-folds lipid accumulation in UFA-treated hepatocytes via blockade of the TLR7 signaling pathway's IGF-1 release compared to only UFA-treated hepatocytes. In vivo experiments carried out with TLR7 knockout mice produced results consistent with in vitro experiments. In conclusion  TLR7 prevents progression of NAFLD via induced autophagy and released IGF-1 from liver. These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NAFLD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate in the regulation of autophagy membrane dynamics.Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) is a key player in membrane dynamics and trafficking regulation. Most PI3P is associated with endosomal membranes and with the autophagosome preassembly machinery  presumably at the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme responsible for most PI3P synthesis  VPS34 and proteins such as Beclin1 and ATG14L that regulate PI3P levels are positive modulators of autophagy initiation. It had been assumed that a local PI3P pool was present at autophagosomes and preautophagosomal structures  such as the omegasome and the phagophore. This was recently confirmed by the demonstration that PI3P-binding proteins participate in the complex sequence of signalling that results in autophagosome assembly and activity. Here we summarize the historical discoveries of PI3P lipid kinase involvement in autophagy  and we discuss the proposed role of PI3P during autophagy  notably during the autophagosome biogenesis sequence.,Autophagy_notLIR
Thymoquinone synergizes gemcitabine anti-breast cancer activity via modulating its apoptotic and autophagic activities.The use of anti-cancer adjuvant therapy is rationalized by potentiating the efficacy  and/or protecting from major side effects of chemotherapeutics. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a naturally occurring compound with cumulative evidence of anti-cancer properties. In this study  we assessed the chemomodulatory potential of TQ to gemcitabine (GCB) against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7)  and ductal carcinoma (T47D) cells. TQ showed cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 and T47D with IC<sub>50</sub>'s of 64.9 ± 14 µM and 165 ± 2 µM  respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub>'s of GCB against MCF-7 and T47D were 0.9 ± 0.18 µM and 14.3 ± 2.8 µM and were significantly reduced after combination with TQ to 0.058 ± 12 µM and 2.3 ± 0.2 µM  respectively. The CI- values were indicative of synergism in MCF-7 and T47D cells (0.15 and 0.30  respectively). Further investigation showed that GCB caused significant anti-proliferative effect reflected by increasing cell population in S-phase in both cell lines. TQ potentiated GCB-induced anti-proliferative activity in both cell lines. GCB induced considerable apoptosis in T47D cell line  and TQ significantly increased GCB-induced apoptotic effects by 1.5 to 3.6 folds. Interestingly  GCB  TQ and their combination induced significant autophagic cell death in the apoptosis defected MCF-7 cells. In addition  TQ  GCB and their combination depleted breast cancer associated stem cell (CD44<sup>(+)</sup>/CD24<sup>(-)/(low)</sup>) clone within MCF-7 and T47D cells by 3.8% to 27.5%. In conclusion  TQ showed promising chemomodulatory effects to GCB against breast cancer cells via inducing apoptosis  necrosis and autophagy  in addition to depleting tumor associated resistant stem cell fraction.,Autophagy_notLIR
Potential suppression of the high glucose and insulin-induced retinal neovascularization by Sirtuin 3 in the human retinal endothelial cells.Retinal neovascularization generally play roles in the formation of various severe eye diseases  such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. The regulation of neovascularization-related pathways by Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3)  a major mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase  give us a cue that Sirt3 may participate in the retinal neovascularization. However  the mechanism remains unclear. Here  we established a retinal neovascularization model by using human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) under the induction of high glucose and insulin (HGI). With this model  Sirt3-expressing lentivirus was constructed and then used to investigate the effect of Sirt3 overexpression on the expression of migration-  neovascularization- and autophagy-related genes. After the treatment of HGI on HRECs  the mRNA and protein levels of migration-related genes  including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9  were significantly upregulated. Meanwhile  angiogenesis-related genes  including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)  and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were promoted at both mRNA and protein levels. However  HGI had no clear effect on the mRNA and protein levels of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)  an autophagy-related gene. When Sirt3 was overexpressed by lentivirus infection after HGI  the upregulation of MMP-2  MMP-9  VEGF  HIF-1α  and IGF-1 were suppressed at both transcription and translation levels. At the same time  LC3 mRNA and LC3-II protein increased. These results suggest that Sirt3 may inhibit retinal neovascularization by regulating the migration-  neovascularization- and autophagy-related factors expression. Thus we argue that Sirt3 may be a potential candidate drug for curing various eye diseases induced by retinal neovascularization.,Autophagy_notLIR
Leptin Attenuates the Contractile Function of Adult Rat Cardiomyocytes Involved in Oxidative Stress and Autophagy.Leptin has been identified as an important protein involved in obesity. As a chronic metabolic disorder  obesity is associated with a high risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases  including heart failure. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects and the mechanism of leptin on the contractile function of cardiomyocytes in the adult rat.,Autophagy_notLIR
Novel organometallic chloroquine derivative inhibits tumor growth.Autophagy has emerged as a mechanism critical to both tumorigenesis and development of resistance to multiple lines of anti-cancer therapy. Therefore  targeting autophagy and alternative cell death pathways has arisen as a viable strategy for refractory tumors. The anti-malarial 4-aminoquinoline compounds chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently being considered for re-purposing as anti-cancer therapies intended to sensitize different tumors by targeting the lysosomal cell death pathway. Here  we describe a novel organometallic chloroquine derivative  cymanquine  that exhibits enhanced bioactivity compared to chloroquine in both normal  and reduced pH tumor microenvironments  thus overcoming a defined limitation of traditional 4-aminoquinolines. In vitro  cymanquine exhibits greater potency than CQ in a diverse panel of human cancer cell lines  including melanoma  in both normal pH and in reduced pH conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment. Cymanquine treatment results in greater lysosomal accumulation than chloroquine and induces lysosomal dysfunction leading to autophagy blockade. Using a mouse model of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma  cymanquine slowed tumor growth greater than hydroxychloroquine  and when used in combination with vemurafenib  cymanquine partially restored sensitivity to vemurafenib. Overall  we show that cymanquine exhibits superior lysosomal accumulation and autophagy blockade than either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in vitro; and in addition to its high level of tolerability in mice  exhibits superior in vivo efficacy in a model of human melanoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Metastatic prostate cancer-associated P62 inhibits autophagy flux and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition by sustaining the level of HDAC6.P62 (also named sequestosome-1  SQSTM1) is involved in autophagy regulation through multiple pathways. It interacts with autophagosomes-associated LC3-II and ubiquitinated protein aggregates to engulf the aggregates in autophagosomes  interacts with HDAC6 to inhibit its deacetylase activity to maintain the levels of acetylated α-tubulin and stabilities of microtubules to enhance autophagosome trafficking  and regulates autophagy initiation and cell survival. We performed immunohistochemistry staining of P62 in prostate tissues from prostate cancer patients and found that levels of P62 in patients with prostate adenocarcinomas (PCA) are significantly higher than those in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). High levels of P62 predict high tumor grade and high intensity of metastasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cancer-associated cachexia.Cancer-associated cachexia is a disorder characterized by loss of body weight with specific losses of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Cachexia is driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and metabolic changes  including elevated energy expenditure  excess catabolism and inflammation. Cachexia is highly associated with cancers of the pancreas  oesophagus  stomach  lung  liver and bowel; this group of malignancies is responsible for half of all cancer deaths worldwide. Cachexia involves diverse mediators derived from the cancer cells and cells within the tumour microenvironment  including inflammatory and immune cells. In addition  endocrine  metabolic and central nervous system perturbations combine with these mediators to elicit catabolic changes in skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue. At the tissue level  mechanisms include activation of inflammation  proteolysis  autophagy and lipolysis. Cachexia associates with a multitude of morbidities encompassing functional  metabolic and immune disorders as well as aggravated toxicity and complications of cancer therapy. Patients experience impaired quality of life  reduced physical  emotional and social well-being and increased use of healthcare resources. To date  no effective medical intervention completely reverses cachexia and there are no approved drug therapies. Adequate nutritional support remains a mainstay of cachexia therapy  whereas drugs that target overactivation of catabolic processes  cell injury and inflammation are currently under investigation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Increased autophagy is required to protect periodontal ligament stem cells from apoptosis in inflammatory microenvironment.Autophagy  which provides a mechanism for turnover cellular organelles and proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway  has been related to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders and other diseases. Therefore  the aim of this research was to study the role of autophagy in periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and provide a new strategy for treatment or prevention of periodontitis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Long noncoding RNA HAGLROS regulates apoptosis and autophagy in colorectal cancer cells via sponging miR-100 to target ATG5 expression.The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the expression of HOXD antisense growth-associated long noncoding RNA (HAGLROS) and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)  as well as the roles and regulatory mechanism of HAGLROS in CRC development. The HAGLROS expression in CRC tissues and cells was detected. The correlation between HAGLROS expression and survival time of CRC patients was investigated. Moreover  HAGLROS was overexpressed and suppressed in HCT-116 cells  followed by detection of cell viability  apoptosis  and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and autophagy markers. Furthermore  the association between HAGLROS and miR-100 and the potential targets of miR-100 were investigated. Besides  the regulatory relationship between HAGLROS and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was elucidated. The results showed that HAGLROS was highly expressed in CRC tissues and cells. Highly expression of HAGLROS correlated with a shorter survival time of CRC patients. Moreover  knockdown of HAGLROS in HCT-116 cells induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio  cleaved-caspase-3  and cleaved-caspase-9  and inhibited autophagy by decreasing the expression of LC3II/LC3I and Beclin-1 and increasing P62 expression. Furthermore  HAGLROS negatively regulated the expression of miR-100  and HAGLROS controlled HCT-116 cell apoptosis and autophagy through negatively regulation of miR-100. Autophagy related 5 (ATG5) was verified as a functional target of miR-100 and miR-100 regulated HCT-116 cell apoptosis and autophagy through targeting ATG5. Besides  HAGLROS overexpression activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway. In conclusion  a highly expression of HAGLROS correlated with shorter survival time of CRC patients. Downregulation of HAGLROS may induce apoptosis and inhibit autophagy in CRC cells by regulation of miR-100/ATG5 axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quercetin induces autophagy via FOXO1-dependent pathways and autophagy suppression enhances quercetin-induced apoptosis in PASMCs in hypoxia.Quercetin  an important dietary flavonoid has been demonstrated to potentially reverse or even prevent pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progression. However  the effects of quercetin on apoptosis and autophagy in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) have not yet been clearly elucidated. The current study found that quercetin significantly induce the apoptotic and autophagic capacities of PASMCs in vitro and in vivo in hypoxia. In addition  we found that quercetin increases FOXO1 (a major mediator in autophagy regulation) expression and transcriptional activity. Moreover  FOXO1 knockdown by siRNAs inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and 4E-BPI  which is downstream of P70-S6K  and markedly blocked quercetin-induced autophagy. We also observed that FOXO1-mediated autophagy was achieved via SESN3 not Rictor upregulation and after mTOR suppression. Furthermore  Treatment with autophagy-specific inhibitors could markedly enhance quercetin-induced apoptosis in PASMCs under hypoxia. Finally  quercetin in combination with autophagy inhibition treatment could enhance the therapeutic effects of quercetin in hypoxia-associated PAH in vivo. Taken together  quercetin could enhance hypoxia-induced autophagy through the FOXO1-SENS3-mTOR pathway in PASMCs. Combining quercetin and autophagy inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating hypoxia-associated PAH.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysosomes in programmed cell death pathways: from initiators to amplifiers.Lysosome is the central organelle for intracellular degradation of biological macromolecules and organelles. The material destined for degradation enters the lysosomes primarily via endocytosis  autophagy and phagocytosis  and is degraded through the concerted action of more than 50 lysosomal hydrolases. However  lysosomes are also linked with numerous other processes  including cell death  inflammasome activation and immune response  as well as with lysosomal secretion and cholesterol recycling. Among them programmed cell death pathways including apoptosis have received major attention. In most of these pathways  cell death was accompanied by lysosomal membrane permeabilization and release of lysosomal constituents with an involvement of lysosomal hydrolases  including the cathepsins. However  it is less clear  whether lysosomal membrane permeabilization is really critical for the initiation of cell death programme(s). Therefore  the role of lysosomal membrane permeabilization in various programmed cell death pathways is reviewed  as well as the mechanisms leading to it.,Autophagy_notLIR
A TRIM16-Galactin3 Complex Mediates Autophagy of Damaged Endomembranes.Selective autophagy  an essential process for maintaining intracellular homeostasis  depends on precise target recognition and local activation.

Apoptosis: Mediator Molecules  Interplay with Other Cell Death Processes and Therapeutic Potentials.Apoptosis  a form of programmed cell death  plays a very crucial role in various physiological processes for maintaining cell homeostasis. This process has several characteristic features like membrane blebbing  nuclear condensation  DNA fragmentation and cell shrinkage. Any defect in this highly regulated process eventually leads to extended cell survival and could result in neoplastic cell expansion followed by genetic instability. The apoptotic machinery is mainly processed and regulated by various caspases  a family of cysteine proteases. Significant advancement has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis which provides new insights in modulating the life or death of a cell. The main goal of this review is to highlight recent updates on apoptosis  the cross-talk with other cellular death processes and its therapeutic potentials.,Autophagy_notLIR
Silencing Livin improved the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil by regulating crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Currently  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of CRC; however  5-FU resistance during treatment has become a common problem. Livin  a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family  is considered to be associated with tumor resistance to chemotherapy. In the present study  Livin-silenced cells were generated by introducing a lentivirus into HCT116 and SW620 colon cancer cell lines. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining was used as an indicator of cell death. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels  and transmission electron microscopy was used to assess autophagy. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 5-FU in colon cancer cells was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The results of the present study confirmed that silencing Livin significantly enhanced colon cancer cell death in the presence of 5-FU  increased expression levels of various apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins and augmented chemotherapeutic sensitivity to 5-FU. Furthermore  the present study demonstrated that this effect may be reversed when autophagy or apoptosis was inhibited  indicating that apoptosis and autophagy were involved in this process. The protein kinase B signaling pathway and B-cell lymphoma-2 expression levels significantly decreased following Livin knockdown  suggesting they may contribute to the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy crosstalk  which caused the Livin knockdown-induced cell death observed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ivermectin induces PAK1-mediated cytostatic autophagy in breast cancer.Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that has recently been demonstrated to exhibit potent anticancer activity against colon cancer  ovarian cancer  melanoma and leukemia. However  the molecular mechanism underlying this anticancer effect remains poorly understood. We recently found that ivermectin markedly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells by stimulating cytostatic macroautophagy/autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Ivermectin inhibits the AKT-MTOR signaling pathway by promoting ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1)  leading to increased autophagic flux. Together  our work unravels the molecular mechanism underpinning ivermectin-induced cytostatic autophagy in breast cancer  and characterizes ivermectin as a potential therapeutic option for breast cancer treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inactivation of autophagy leads to changes in sebaceous gland morphology and function.We have reported recently that inactivation of the essential autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) in keratinocytes has little or no impact on morphology and function of the epidermal barrier in experimental animals. When these mice aged  mutant males  (Atg7 ΔKC)  developed an oily coat. As the keratin 14 promoter driven cre/LoxP system inactivates floxed Atg7 in all keratin 14 (K14) expressing cells  including sebocytes  we investigated whether the oily hair phenotype was the consequence of changes in function of the skin sebaceous glands. Using an antibody to the GFP-LC3 fusion protein  autophagosomes were detected at the border of sebocyte disintegration in control but not in mutant animals  suggesting that autophagy was (a) active in normal sebaceous glands and (b) was inactivated in the mutant mice. Detailed analysis established that dorsal sebaceous glands were about twice as large in all Atg7 ΔKC mice compared to those of controls (Atg7 F/F)  and their rate of sebocyte proliferation was increased. In addition  male mutant mice yielded twice as much lipid per unit hair as age-matched controls. Analysis of sebum lipids by thin layer chromatography revealed a 40% reduction in the proportion of free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol  and a 5-fold increase in the proportion of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). In addition  the most common diester wax species (58-60 carbon atoms) were increased  while shorter species (54-55 carbon atoms) were under-represented in mutant sebum. Our data show that autophagy contributes to sebaceous gland function and to the control of sebum composition.,Autophagy_notLIR
TNF-α induces autophagy through ERK1/2 pathway to regulate apoptosis in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis model cells IEC-6.Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a potentially fatal illness in premature neonates. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and autophagy are associated with the pathogenesis of NEC. This study aimed to explore whether TNF-α might regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC model cells IEC-6 via regulation of autophagy. NEC rat model was induced by hand feeding and exposure to asphyxia/cold-stress for histologic examination. The NEC in vitro model (IEC-6/NEC cells) was established by stimulating the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS  100 μg/mL) for 3 h to investigate the effects of TNF-α on IEC-6 proliferation and apoptosis. In this study  NEC rats showed decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression  increased TUNEL-positive cells  higher expression of TNF-α  p-ERK1/2  and autophagy-related proteins in rat small intestine compared with their controls. Additionally  the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/NEC cells showed a significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with the control cells. Furthermore  the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/NEC cells exhibited enhanced autophagy level  as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in Beclin-1 protein expression  LC3II/LC3I ratio and accumulation of MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles. Moreover  inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or LY294002 significantly abolished the LPS-mediated decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of IEC-6/NEC cells. Results also showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway using U0126 significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced autophagy. Furthermore  the TNF-α-mediated inhibition of IEC-6 proliferation and promotion of IEC-6 apoptosis was abolished by U0126. Our findings demonstrated that TNF-α might induce autophagy through ERK1/2 pathway to regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC cells IEC-6. Our study enhances our understanding of neonatal NEC pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cytoprotective Mechanisms in Fatty Liver Preservation against Cold Ischemia Injury: A Comparison between IGL-1 and HTK.Institute Goeorges Lopez 1 (IGL-1) and Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) preservation solutions are regularly used in clinical for liver transplantation besides University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and Celsior. Several clinical trials and experimental works have been carried out comparing all the solutions  however the comparative IGL-1 and HTK appraisals are poor; especially when they deal with the underlying protection mechanisms of the fatty liver graft during cold storage. Fatty livers from male obese Zücker rats were conserved for 24 h at 4 °C in IGL-1 or HTK preservation solutions. After organ recovery and rinsing of fatty liver grafts with Ringer Lactate solution  we measured the changes in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activation  liver autophagy markers (Beclin-1  Beclin-2  LC3B and ATG7) and apoptotic markers (caspase 3  caspase 9 and TUNEL). These determinations were correlated with the prevention of liver injury (aspartate and alanine aminostransferase (AST/ALT)  histology) and mitochondrial damage (glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and confocal microscopy findings). Liver grafts preserved in IGL-1 solution showed a marked reduction on p-TOR/mTOR ratio when compared to HTK. This was concomitant with significant increased cyto-protective autophagy and prevention of liver apoptosis  including inflammatory cytokines such as HMGB1. Together  our results revealed that IGL-1 preservation solution better protected fatty liver grafts against cold ischemia damage than HTK solution. IGL-1 protection was associated with a reduced liver damage  higher induced autophagy and decreased apoptosis. All these effects would contribute to limit the subsequent extension of reperfusion injury after graft revascularization in liver transplantation procedures.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tumor-Intrinsic PD-L1 Signals Regulate Cell Growth  Pathogenesis  and Autophagy in Ovarian Cancer and Melanoma.PD-L1 antibodies produce efficacious clinical responses in diverse human cancers  but the basis for their effects remains unclear  leaving a gap in the understanding of how to rationally leverage therapeutic activity. PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumor cells  but its contributions to tumor pathogenicity are incompletely understood. In this study  we evaluated the hypothesis that PD-L1 exerts tumor cell-intrinsic signals that are critical for pathogenesis. Using RNAi methodology  we attenuated PD-L1 in the murine ovarian cell line ID8agg and the melanoma cell line B16 (termed PD-L1<sup>lo</sup> cells)  which express basal PD-L1. We observed that PD-L1<sup>lo</sup> cells proliferated more weakly than control cells in vitro As expected  PD-L1<sup>lo</sup> cells formed tumors in immunocompetent mice relatively more slowly  but unexpectedly  they also formed tumors more slowly in immunodeficient NSG mice. RNA sequencing analysis identified a number of genes involved in autophagy and mTOR signaling that were affected by PD-L1 expression. In support of a functional role  PD-L1 attenuation augmented autophagy and blunted the ability of autophagy inhibitors to limit proliferation in vitro and in vivo in NSG mice. PD-L1 attenuation also reduced mTORC1 activity and augmented the antiproliferative effects of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. PD-L1<sup>lo</sup> cells were also relatively deficient in metastasis to the lung  and we found that anti-PD-L1 administration could block tumor cell growth and metastasis in NSG mice. This therapeutic effect was observed with B16 cells but not ID8agg cells  illustrating tumor- or compartmental-specific effects in the therapeutic setting. Overall  our findings extend understanding of PD-L1 functions  illustrate nonimmune effects of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy  and suggest broader uses for PD-L1 as a biomarker for assessing cancer therapeutic responses.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and potential anticancer therapy.Mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF) has been identified as an important factor in various diseases ranging from neurological disorders  to diseases of the cardiovascular system and metabolic syndromes. MDF was also found in cancer as well as in cancer predisposition syndromes with defective DNA damage response (DDR) machinery. Moreover  a recent highlight arises from the detection of MDF in eukaryotic cells upon treatment with antibiotics. In this review  we focus on recent studies of MDF in pathological conditions with a particular emphasis on the effects of various classes of antibiotics on mitochondria. Special attention is given to the role of autophagy/mitophagy in MDF and repurposing antibiotics as anticancer drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Conformational flexibility of BECN1: Essential to its key role in autophagy and beyond.BECN1 (Beclin 1)  a highly conserved eukaryotic protein  is a key regulator of autophagy  a cellular homeostasis pathway  and also participates in vacuolar protein sorting  endocytic trafficking  and apoptosis. BECN1 is important for embryonic development  the innate immune response  tumor suppression  and protection against neurodegenerative disorders  diabetes  and heart disease. BECN1 mediates autophagy as a core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes. However  the exact mechanism by which it regulates the activity of these complexes  or mediates its other diverse functions is unclear. BECN1 interacts with several diverse protein partners  perhaps serving as a scaffold or interaction hub for autophagy. Based on extensive structural  biophysical and bioinformatics analyses  BECN1 consists of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)  which includes a BH3 homology domain (BH3D); a flexible helical domain (FHD); a coiled-coil domain (CCD); and a β-α-repeated autophagy-specific domain (BARAD). Each of these BECN1 domains mediates multiple diverse interactions that involve concomitant conformational changes. Thus  BECN1 conformational flexibility likely plays a key role in facilitating diverse protein interactions. Further  BECN1 conformation and interactions are also modulated by numerous post-translational modifications. A better structure-based understanding of the interplay between different BECN1 conformational and binding states  and the impact of post-translational modifications will be essential to elucidating the mechanism of its multiple biological roles.,Autophagy_notLIR
I Spy in the Developing Fly a Multitude of Ways to Die.Cell proliferation and cell death are two opposing  yet complementary fundamental processes in development. Cell proliferation provides new cells  while developmental programmed cell death adjusts cell numbers and refines structures as an organism grows. Apoptosis is the best-characterized form of programmed cell death; however  there are many other non-apoptotic forms of cell death that occur throughout development. <i>Drosophila</i> is an excellent model for studying these varied forms of cell death given the array of cellular  molecular  and genetic techniques available. In this review  we discuss select examples of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death that occur in different tissues and at different stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development. For example  apoptosis occurs throughout the nervous system to achieve an appropriate number of neurons. Elsewhere in the fly  non-apoptotic modes of developmental cell death are employed  such as in the elimination of larval salivary glands and midgut during metamorphosis. These and other examples discussed here demonstrate the versatility of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model organism for elucidating the diverse modes of programmed cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Degradation of AMPK-α1 sensitizes BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells to arginine deprivation.Melanomas harboring BRAF mutation (V600E) are known to recur frequently following treatment with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) despite a high initial response rate. Our previous study has uncovered that BRAFi-resistant melanoma (BR) cells are vulnerable to arginine deprivation. It has been reported that naïve melanoma cells undergo autophagy and re-express argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) to enable them to synthesize arginine for survival when encountering arginine deprivation. Abolishing these two factors in BR cells confers sensitivity to arginine deprivation. In this report  we further demonstrated that downregulation of AMPK-α1 in BR cells is a major factor contributing to impairment of autophagy as evidenced by decreased autophagosome formation. These BR cells also showed a metabolic shift from glucose to arginine dependence  which was supported by decreased expressions of GLUT1 (glucose transporter) and hexokinase II (HKII) coupled with less glucose uptake but high levels of arginine transporter CAT-2 expression. Furthermore  silencing CAT-2 expression also distinctly attenuated BR cell proliferation. Notably  when naïve melanoma cells became BR cells by long-term exposure to BRAFi  a stepwise degradation of AMPK-α1 was initiated via ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We discovered that a novel E3 ligase  RING finger 44 (RNF44)  is responsible for promoting AMPK-α1 degradation in BR cells. RNF44 expression in BR cells was upregulated by transcription factor CREB triggered by hyperactivation of ERK/AKT. High levels of RNF44 corresponding to low levels of AMPK-α1 appeared in BR xenografts and melanoma tumor samples from BR and BRAFi/MEK inhibitor (MEKi)-resistant (BMR) melanoma patients. Similar to BR cells  BMR cells were also sensitive to arginine deprivation. Our study provides a novel insight into the mechanism whereby BRAFi or BRAFi/MEKi resistance drives proteasomal degradation of AMPK-α1 and consequently regulates autophagy and metabolic reprogramming in melanoma cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Peroxisomes and Kidney Injury.Peroxisomes are organelles present in most eukaryotic cells. The organs with the highest density of peroxisomes are the liver and kidneys. Peroxisomes possess more than fifty enzymes and fulfill a multitude of biological tasks. They actively participate in apoptosis  innate immunity  and inflammation. In recent years  a considerable amount of evidence has been collected to support the involvement of peroxisomes in the pathogenesis of kidney injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pathological missorting of endogenous MAPT/Tau in neurons caused by failure of protein degradation systems.Missorting of MAPT/Tau represents one of the early signs of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. The triggers for this are still a matter of debate. Here we investigated the sorting mechanisms of endogenous MAPT in mature primary neurons using microfluidic chambers (MFCs) where cell compartments can be observed separately. Blocking protein degradation pathways with proteasomal or autophagy inhibitors dramatically increased the missorting of MAPT in dendrites on the neuritic side  suggesting that degradation of MAPT in dendrites is a major determinant for the physiological axonal distribution of MAPT. Such missorted dendritic MAPT differed in its phosphorylation pattern from axonal MAPT. By contrast  enhancing autophagy or proteasomal pathways strongly reduced MAPT missorting  thereby confirming the role of protein degradation pathways in the polar distribution of MAPT. Dendritic missorting of MAPT by blocking protein degradation resulted in the loss of spines but not in overall cell toxicity. Inhibition of local protein synthesis in dendrites eliminated the missorting of MAPT  indicating that the accumulation of dendritic MAPT is locally generated. In support of this  a substantial fraction of Mapt/Tau mRNA was detected in dendrites. Taken together  our results indicate that the autophagy and proteasomal pathways play important roles in fine-tuning dendritic MAPT levels and thereby prevent synaptic toxicity caused by MAPT accumulation.

TLR2 Regulates Allergic Airway Inflammation and Autophagy Through PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate pattern recognition receptors that play a critical role in allergic inflammation  yet their contribution to autophagy in asthma remains poorly defined. Here  we investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway-mediated autophagy in ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation in mice. Wild-type (WT) and TLR2-knockout (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>) C57BL/6 mice were ovalbumin-sensitized and ovalbumin-challenged. In ovalbumin-challenged WT mice  enhanced expression of TLR2 in lung tissue  remarkable inflammatory cell infiltrates  goblet cell hyperplasia  and increased mucus production were observed. The number of inflammatory cells and interleukin-13 (IL-13) levels increased  while interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Expression of PI3K  phospho-Akt  Beclin-1 and LC3-II was enhanced significantly. These changes were mitigated dose-dependently in 3-methyl adenine-treated mice. In contrast  similar but weaker changes were found in ovalbumin-challenged TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice  and the changes were not significantly attenuated by 3-methyl adenine treatment. These results indicate that TLR2 confers a pivotal role in allergic airway inflammation via regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related autophagy in mice.,Autophagy_notLIR

Neferine  is not inducer but blocker for macroautophagic flux targeting on lysosome malfunction.Neferine  an alkaloid isolated from Lotus seeds  displays multiple pharmacological effects that counter cancer  oxidants  and arrhythmia. It was initially identified as a strong inducer for macroautophagy in cancer cells by suppressing AMPK/mTOR signaling. In this study  we found that autophagy signaling was inhibited in the condition of neferine treatment. Exposure to neferine resulted in the accumulation of LC3-II and an associated adaptor protein  p62/SQSTM1. Knockdown of ATG5 failed to reduce the accumulation of LC3-II induced by neferine. The electron microscopy (EM) images showed that neferine induce accumulation of multi-vesicle bodies (MVB) and failure of lysosome maturation. Moreover  exposure to neferine reduced maturation of cathepsin D and impaired the degradation of autophagic and phagocytic cargos. Rather than stimulate autophagic flux  the data indicate that neferine impaired lysosomes to block degradation within phagolysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Vitamin D3 intake modulates diaphragm but not peripheral muscle force in young mice.Recent data support an important role for vitamin D in respiratory health. We tested the hypothesis that dietary vitamin D3 (VD3) intake modulates diaphragm (DIA) strength. Four-week-old female A/J mice (n = 10/group) were randomized to receive diets containing 100 IU VD3/kg (low)  1 000 IU VD3/kg (reference)  or 10 000 IU VD3/kg (pharmacologic). After 6 wk of dietary intervention  plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) levels  DIA and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in vitro contractile properties  and fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition and Akt/Foxo3A growth signaling were studied in the DIA and tibialis anterior. Mice fed the low  reference  and pharmacologic diets had average 25D3 levels of 7  21  and 59 ng/ml  respectively. Maximal DIA force  twitch force  and fiber CSA were reduced 26%  28%  and 10% (P < 0.01)  respectively  in mice receiving the low-VD3 diet compared with the reference and pharmacologic diets. EDL force parameters were unaltered by diet. Effects of VD3 intake on DIA force were not observed in mice that began dietary intervention at 12 wk of age. VD3 intake did not alter the MHC composition of the DIA  indicating that decreases in force and CSA in young mice were not due to a switch in fiber type. Paradoxically  low VD3 intake was associated with activation of anabolic signaling in muscle (hyperphosphorylation of Akt and Foxo3A and decreased expression of autophagy marker LC3). These studies identify a potential role of dietary VD3 in regulating DIA development and insulin sensitivity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Functions and regulatory mechanisms of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1.Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a long noncoding RNA whose transcript is around 8 kb in length. As an important stress response molecule  MALAT1 can be expressed differently under stress conditions  such as hypoxia  high glucose  hydrogen peroxide  ultraviolet irradiation  infection  and chemical stimulation. MALAT1 is involved in regulating multiple cell behaviors  such as proliferation  apoptosis  differentiation  migration  epithelial-mesenchymal transition  autophagy  and morphological maintenance. Extensive evidence show that MALAT1 plays critical roles in the physiopathological process of embryo implantation  angiogenesis  tissue inflammation  tumor progression  liver fibrosis  cardiovascular remodeling  and diabetes progression by regulating gene transcription  forming RNA-protein complexes with proteins as a structural component  regulating protein activity  assisting protein localization  mediating epigenetic changes  or by acting as a competing endogenous RNA. Furthermore  MALAT1 can affect the sensitivity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; therefore  it could be used as a potential drug target for chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitization. The levels of MALAT1 are reported to be overexpressed in most tumor tissues or sera  and the expression levels of MALAT1 often affect the tumor size  stage  lymph node metastasis  and distant invasion. Therefore  MALAT1 can be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis  severity assessment  or prognostic assessment. This review outlines the current understanding of the biological role and function of MALAT1. In the meantime  we have summarized the mechanisms involved in the reulation of MALAT1 expression and the mechanisms by which MALAT1 regulates the physiological and pathological processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy Induction by HIV-Tat and Methamphetamine in Primary Midbrain Neuronal Cells of Tree Shrews via the mTOR Signaling and ATG5/ATG7 Pathway.<b>Background:</b> Addictive stimulant drugs  such as methamphetamine (METH)  increase the risk of exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and thus predispose individuals to the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs). Previous studies have indicated that HIV-Tat (the transactivator of transcription) and METH can synergistically induce autophagy in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and that autophagy plays a pivotal role in the neuronal dysfunction in HANDs. However  the underlying mechanism of METH-and HIV-Tat-induced neuronal autophagy remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We cultured primary midbrain neuronal cells of tree shrews and treated them with METH and HIV-Tat to study the role of METH and HIV-Tat in inducing autophagy. We evaluated the effects of the single or combined treatment of METH and HIV-Tat on the protein expressions of the autophagy-related genes  including Beclin-1 and LC3B  ATG5  and ATG7 in METH and HIV-Tat-induced autophagy. In addition  the presence of autophagosomes in the METH and/or HIV-Tat treatment was revealed using transmission electron microscopy. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that METH increased the protein levels of LC3B and Beclin-1  and these effects were significantly enhanced by HIV-Tat. Moreover  the results suggested that ATG5 and ATG7 were involved in the METH and HIV-Tat-induced autophagy. In addition  it was found that mTOR inhibition via pharmacological intervention could trigger autophagy and promote METH and HIV-Tat-induced autophagy. <b>Discussion:</b> Overall  this study contributes to the knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of METH and HIV-Tat-induced autophagy in primary midbrain neuronal cells. Our findings may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for METH-and HIV-Tat-induced autophagy in HANDs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Modulation of V-ATPase by βA3/A1-Crystallin in Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.We have previously demonstrated that βA3/A1-crystallin  a member of the β/γ-crystallin superfamily  is expressed in the astrocytes and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the eye. In order to understand the physiological functions of βA3/A1-crystallin in RPE cells  we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice where Cryba1  the gene encoding βA3/A1-crystallin  is deleted specifically from the RPE using the Cre-loxP system. By utilizing the cKO model  we have shown that this protein is required by RPE cells for proper lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (OS) that have been internalized in phagosomes and also for the proper functioning of the autophagy process. We also reported that βA3/A1-crystallin is trafficked to lysosomes  where it regulates endolysosomal acidification by modulating the activity of the lysosomal V-ATPase complex. Our results show that the V-ATPase activity in cKO RPE is significantly lower than WT RPE. Since  V-ATPase is important for regulating lysosomal pH  we noticed that endolysosomal pH was higher in the cKO cells compared to the WT cells. Increased lysosomal pH in cKO RPE is also associated with reduced Cathepsin D activity. Cathepsin D is a major lysosomal aspartic protease involved in the degradation of the OS and hence we believe that reduced proteolytic activity contributes to impaired degradation of OS in the cKO RPE. Reduced lysosomal activity in the cKO RPE also contributes to the incomplete degradation of the autophagosomes. Our results also suggest that βA3/A1-crystallin regulates V-ATPase activity by binding to the V0 subunit of the V-ATPase complex. Taken together  these results suggest a novel mechanism by which βA3/A1-crystallin regulates lysosomal function by modulating the activity of V-ATPase.,Autophagy_notLIR
Programmed cell death 50 (and beyond).In the 50 years since we described cell death as 'programmed ' we have come far  thanks to the efforts of many brilliant researchers  and we now understand the mechanics  the biochemistry  and the genetics of many of the ways in which cells can die. This knowledge gives us the resources to alter the fates of many cells. However  not all cells respond similarly to the same stimulus  in either sensitivity to the stimulus or timing of the response. Cells prevented from dying through one pathway may survive  survive in a crippled state  or die following a different pathway. To fully capitalize on our knowledge of cell death  we need to understand much more about how cells are targeted to die and what aspects of the history  metabolism  or resources available to individual cells determine how each cell reaches and crosses the threshold at which it commits to death.,Autophagy_notLIR

MTOR-independent autophagy induced by interrupted endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> communication: a dead end in cancer cells.The interruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> communication induces a bioenergetic crisis characterized by an increase of MTOR-independent AMPK-dependent macroautophagic/autophagic flux  which is not sufficient to reestablish the metabolic and energetic homeostasis in cancer cells. Here  we propose that upon ER-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer inhibition  AMPK present at the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) activate localized autophagy via BECN1 (beclin 1). This local response could prevent the proper interorganelle communication that would allow the autophagy-derived metabolites to reach the necessary anabolic pathways to maintain mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis.

Fowl adenovirus serotype 4-induced apoptosis  autophagy  and a severe inflammatory response in liver.Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is a hepatotrophic virus that causes severe liver diseases. Upon histological examination  the most remarkable findings in the liver are small multifocal areas of necrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration  including basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatocytes surrounded by a clear halo or which fill the entire nucleus. Here  we examined the mechanism responsible for FAdV-4-mediated hepatocyte damage in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that FAdV-4 impaired liver integrity and function  which decreased albumin and blood glucose concentrations and increased the plasma activity of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase  compared with a non-infected control group (P<0.05). FAdV-4 induced hepatocyte apoptosis in a time-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. Additionally  we found that FAdV-4 also induced the autophagy of hepatocytes  which promoted the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I) to LC3-II  which is a hallmarks of autophagy. Furthermore  the mRNA expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β  IL-6  IL-8  and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in vivo and in vitro showed a statistically significant increase (P<0.05) compared to that of the control group. However  the molecular mechanisms underlying the FAdV-4-induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death remain unclear. In summation  our observations suggested that FAdV-4 induced liver injury via apoptosis  autophagy  and a severe inflammatory response.,Autophagy_notLIR
Fisetin Protects PC12 Cells from Tunicamycin-Mediated Cell Death via Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging and Modulation of Nrf2-Driven Gene Expression  SIRT1 and MAPK Signaling in PC12 Cells.Fisetin (3 7 3' 4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonol and exhibits antioxidant  anti-inflammatory  and neuroprotective activities. However  high concentration of fisetin is reported to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS)  induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cause cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the cytoprotective effects of low concentration of fisetin against tunicamycin (Tm)-mediated cytotoxicity in neuronal-like catecholaminergic PC12 cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Integrating multiple omics data for the discovery of potential Beclin-1 interactions in breast cancer.Breast cancer has been reported as one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant diseases and the leading cause of cancer death in women all around the world. Furthermore  this complicated cancer is divided into multiple subtypes which present different clinical symptoms and need correspondingly directed therapy. We took BECN1  a core gene in autophagy performing a tumor inhibitory effect  as a starting point. The study in this paper aims to identify genes related to breast cancer and its multiple subtypes by integrating multiple omics data using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)  which is a statistical method that can integrate more than two types of omics data. All the data is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform which stores clinical and molecular tumor data. The model constructed is based on three kinds of data including mRNA-gene expression with a dependent variable level  DNA methylation and copy number alterations as independent variables. Finally  we propose four subnets of four subtypes of breast cancer  and consider as a result of microarray analysis that AFF3 is associated with BECN1 in breast cancer  and may be a potential therapeutic target. This finding may provide some potential targeted therapeutics for the four different subtypes of breast cancer at the genetic level. In conclusion  finding out the major role Beclin-1 plays in breast cancer subtypes is of great value. The results obtained are instructive for further research and may provide excellent results in clinical applications  as well as testing in animal experiments  and may also indicate a new method to perform bioinformatics analysis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dietary restriction and lifespan: Lessons from invertebrate models.Dietary restriction (DR) is the most robust environmental manipulation known to increase active and healthy lifespan in many species. Despite differences in the protocols and the way DR is carried out in different organisms  conserved relationships are emerging among multiple species. Elegant studies from numerous model organisms are further defining the importance of various nutrient-signaling pathways including mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)  insulin/IGF-1-like signaling and sirtuins in mediating the effects of DR. We here review current advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms altered by DR to promote lifespan in three major invertebrate models  the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.,Autophagy_notLIR

PTENα regulates mitophagy and maintains mitochondrial quality control.PTEN plays an important role in tumor suppression  and PTEN family members are involved in multiple biological processes in various subcellular locations. Here we report that PTENα  the first identified PTEN isoform  regulates mitophagy through promotion of PARK2 recruitment to damaged mitochondria. We show that PTENα-deficient mice exhibit accumulation of cardiac mitochondria with structural and functional abnormalities  and PTENα-deficient mouse hearts are more susceptible to injury induced by isoprenaline and ischemia-reperfusion. Mitochondrial clearance by mitophagy is also impaired in PTENα-deficient cardiomyocytes. In addition  we found PTENα physically interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN  which is an important mediator of mitophagy. PTENα binds PRKN through the membrane binding helix in its N-terminus  and promotes PRKN mitochondrial translocation through enhancing PRKN self-association in a phosphatase-independent manner. Loss of PTENα compromises mitochondrial translocation of PRKN and resultant mitophagy following mitochondrial depolarization. We propose that PTENα functions as a mitochondrial quality controller that maintains mitochondrial function and cardiac homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Overexpression of <i>MdATG18a</i> in apple improves resistance to <i>Diplocarpon mali</i> infection by enhancing antioxidant activity and salicylic acid levels.Marssonina apple blotch  caused by <i>Diplocarpon mali</i>  is one of the most serious diseases of apple. Autophagy plays a key role in pathogen resistance. We previously showed that MdATG18a has a positive influence on drought tolerance. Herein  we describe how overexpression (OE) of <i>MdATG18a</i> enhances resistance to <i>D. mali</i> infection  probably because less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but more salicylic acid (SA) is accumulated in the leaves of OE apple plants. Expression of <i>chitinase</i>  <i>β-1 3-glucanase</i>  and SA-related marker genes was induced more strongly by <i>D. mali</i> in OE lines. Transcript levels of other important <i>MdATG</i> genes were also drastically increased by <i>D. mali</i> in OE plants  which indicated increased autophagy activities. Taken together  these results demonstrate that OE of <i>MdATG18a</i> enhances resistance to infection by <i>D. mali</i> and plays positive roles in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging and SA accumulations. Our findings provide important information for designing strategies which could induce autophagy to minimize the impact of this disease on apple production.,Autophagy_notLIR
The autophagic network and cancer.Mammalian cells harness autophagy to eliminate physiological byproducts of metabolism and cope with microenvironmental perturbations. Moreover  autophagy connects cellular adaptation with extracellular circuitries that impinge on immunity and metabolism. As it links transformed and non-transformed components of the tumour microenvironment  such an autophagic network is important for cancer initiation  progression and response to therapy. Here  we discuss the mechanisms whereby the autophagic network interfaces with multiple aspects of malignant disease.,Autophagy_notLIR

BmATG5 and BmATG6 mediate apoptosis following autophagy induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone or starvation.Autophagy and apoptosis  which could be induced by common stimuli  play crucial roles in development and disease. The functional relationship between autophagy and apoptosis is complex  due to the dual effects of autophagy. In the Bombyx Bm-12 cells  20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) treatment or starvation-induced cell death  with autophagy preceding apoptosis. In response to 20E or starvation  BmATG8 was rapidly cleaved and conjugated with PE to form BmATG8-PE; subsequently  BmATG5 and BmATG6 were cleaved into BmATG5-tN and BmATG6-C  respectively. Reduction of expression of BmAtg5 or BmAtg6 by RNAi decreased the proportion of cells undergoing both autophagy and apoptosis after 20E treatment or starvation. Overexpression of BmAtg5 or BmAtg6 induced autophagy but not apoptosis in the absence of the stimuli  but promoted both autophagy and apoptosis induced by 20E or starvation. Notably  overexpression of cleavage site-deleted BmAtg5 or BmAtg6 increased autophagy but not apoptosis induced by 20E or starvation  whereas overexpression of BmAtg5-tN and BmAtg6-C was able to directly trigger apoptosis or promote the induced apoptosis. In conclusion  being cleaved into BmATG5-tN and BmATG6-C  BmATG5 and BmATG6 mediate apoptosis following autophagy induced by 20E or starvation in Bombyx Bm-12 cells  reflecting that autophagy precedes apoptosis in the midgut during Bombyx metamorphosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Till Death Do Us Part: The Marriage of Autophagy and Apoptosis.Autophagy is a widely conserved catabolic process that is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis under normal physiological conditions and driving the cell to switch back to this status quo under times of starvation  hypoxia  and oxidative stress. The potential similarities and differences between basal autophagy and stimulus-induced autophagy are still largely unknown. Both act by clearing aberrant or unnecessary cytoplasmic material  such as misfolded proteins  supernumerary and defective organelles. The relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy is complex. Cellular ROS is predominantly derived from mitochondria. Autophagy is triggered by this event  and by clearing the defective organelles effectively  it lowers cellular ROS thereby restoring cellular homeostasis. However  if cellular homeostasis cannot be reached  the cells can switch back and choose a regulated cell death response. Intriguingly  the autophagic and cell death machines both respond to the same stresses and share key regulatory proteins  suggesting that the pathways are intricately connected. Here  the intersection between autophagy and apoptosis is discussed with a particular focus on the role ROS plays.,Autophagy_notLIR
Analysis of an acyl-CoA binding protein in Aspergillus oryzae that undergoes unconventional secretion.Acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) plays important roles in the metabolism of lipids in eukaryotic cells. In the industrially important filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae  although we have previously demonstrated that the A. oryzae ACBP (AoACBP) localizes to punctate structures and exhibits long-range motility  which is dependent on autophagy-related proteins  the physiological role of AoACBP remains elusive. Here  we describe identification and characterization of another ACBP from A. oryzae; we named this ACBP as AoAcb2 and accordingly renamed AoACBP as AoAcb1. The deduced amino acid sequence of AoAcb2 lacked a signal peptide. Phylogenetic analysis classified AoAcb2 into a clade that was same as the ACBP Acb1 of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  but was different from that of AoAcb1. In contrast to punctate localization of AoAcb1  AoAcb2 was found to be dispersedly distributed in the cytoplasm  as was previously observed for the S. cerevisiae Acb1. Since we could not generate an Aoacb2 disruptant  we created an Aoacb2 conditional mutant that exhibited less growth under Aoacb2-repressed condition  suggesting that Aoacb2 is an essential gene for growth. Moreover  we observed that A. oryzae AoAcb2  but not A. oryzae AoAcb1  was secreted under carbon-starved condition  suggesting that AoAcb2 might be secreted via the unconventional protein secretion (UPS) pathway  just like S. cerevisiae Acb1. We also demonstrated that the unconventional secretion of AoAcb2 was dependent on the t-SNARE AoSso1  but was independent of the autophagy-related protein AoAtg1  suggesting that the unconventional secretion of AoAcb2  unlike that of S. cerevisiae Acb1  via the UPS pathway  is not regulated by the autophagy machinery. Thus  the filamentous fungus A. oryzae harbors two types of ACBPs  one of which appears to be essential for growth and undergoes unconventional secretion.,Autophagy_notLIR
Coordinated regulation of skeletal muscle mass and metabolic plasticity during recovery from disuse.Skeletal muscle regeneration after disuse is essential for muscle maintenance and involves the regulation of both mass- and metabolic plasticity-related processes. However  the relation between these processes during recovery from disuse remains unclear. In this study  we explored the potential interrelationship between the molecular regulation of muscle mass and oxidative metabolism during recovery from disuse. Molecular profiles were measured in biopsies from the vastus lateralis of healthy men after 1-leg cast immobilization and after 1 wk reloading  and in mouse gastrocnemius obtained before and after hindlimb suspension and during reloading (RL-1  -2  -3  -5  and -8 d). Cluster analysis of the human recovery response revealed correlations between myogenesis and autophagy markers in 2 clusters  which were distinguished by the presence of markers of early myogenesis  autophagosome formation  and mitochondrial turnover vs. markers of late myogenesis  autophagy initiation  and mitochondrial mass. In line with these findings  an early transient increase in B-cell lymphoma-2 interacting protein-3 and sequestosome-1 protein  and GABA type A receptor-associated protein like-1 protein and mRNA and a late increase in myomaker and myosin heavy chain-8 mRNA  microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II:I ratio  and FUN14 domain-containing-1 mRNA and protein were observed in mice. In summary  the regulatory profiles of protein  mitochondrial  and myonuclear turnover are correlated and temporally associated  suggesting a coordinated regulation of muscle mass- and oxidative metabolism-related processes during recovery from disuse.-Kneppers  A.

Branched Chain Amino Acids Cause Liver Injury in Obese/Diabetic Mice by Promoting Adipocyte Lipolysis and Inhibiting Hepatic Autophagy.The Western meat-rich diet is both high in protein and fat. Although the hazardous effect of a high fat diet (HFD) upon liver structure and function is well recognized  whether the co-presence of high protein intake contributes to  or protects against  HF-induced hepatic injury remains unclear. Increased intake of branched chain amino acids (BCAA  essential amino acids compromising 20% of total protein intake) reduces body weight. However  elevated circulating BCAA is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and injury. The mechanisms responsible for this quandary remain unknown; the role of BCAA in HF-induced liver injury is unclear. Utilizing HFD or HFD+BCAA models  we demonstrated BCAA supplementation attenuated HFD-induced weight gain  decreased fat mass  activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  inhibited hepatic lipogenic enzymes  and reduced hepatic triglyceride content. However  BCAA caused significant hepatic damage in HFD mice  evidenced by exacerbated hepatic oxidative stress  increased hepatic apoptosis  and elevated circulation hepatic enzymes. Compared to solely HFD-fed animals  plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in the HFD+BCAA group are significantly further increased  due largely to AMPKα2-mediated adipocyte lipolysis. Lipolysis inhibition normalized plasma FFA levels  and improved insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly  blocking lipolysis failed to abolish BCAA-induced liver injury. Mechanistically  hepatic mTOR activation by BCAA inhibited lipid-induced hepatic autophagy  increased hepatic apoptosis  blocked hepatic FFA/triglyceride conversion  and increased hepatocyte susceptibility to FFA-mediated lipotoxicity. These data demonstrated that BCAA reduces HFD-induced body weight  at the expense of abnormal lipolysis and hyperlipidemia  causing hepatic lipotoxicity. Furthermore  BCAA directly exacerbate hepatic lipotoxicity by reducing lipogenesis and inhibiting autophagy in the hepatocyte.,Autophagy_notLIR
Moderate stress responses and specific changes in polyamine metabolism characterize Scots pine somatic embryogenesis.Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is one of the methods with the highest potential for the vegetative propagation of commercially important coniferous species. However  many conifers  including Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)  are recalcitrant to SE and a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the SE process is needed. In Scots pine SE cultures  embryo production is commonly induced by the removal of auxin  addition of abscisic acid (ABA) and the desiccation of cell masses by polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the present study  we focus on the possible link between the induction of somatic embryo formation and cellular stress responses such as hydrogen peroxide protection  DNA repair  changes in polyamine (PA) metabolism and autophagy. Cellular PA contents and the expression of the PA metabolism genes arginine decarboxylase (ADC)  spermidine synthase (SPDS)  thermospermine synthase (ACL5) and diamine oxidase (DAO) were analyzed  as well as the expression of catalase (CAT)  DNA repair genes (RAD51  KU80) and autophagy-related genes (ATG5  ATG8) throughout the induction of somatic embryo formation in Scots pine SE cultures. Among the embryo-producing SE lines  the expression of ADC  SPDS  ACL5  DAO  CAT  RAD51  KU80 and ATG8 showed consistent profiles. Furthermore  the overall low expression of the stress-related genes suggests that cells in those SE lines were not stressed but recognized the ABA+PEG treatment as a signal to trigger the embryogenic pathway. In those SE lines that were unable to produce embryos  cells seemed to experience the ABA+PEG treatment mostly as osmotic stress and activated a wide range of stress defense mechanisms. Altogether  our results suggest that the direction to the embryogenic pathway is connected with cellular stress responses in Scots pine SE cultures. Thus  the manipulation of stress response pathways may provide a way to enhance somatic embryo production in recalcitrant Scots pine SE lines.,Autophagy_notLIR
Secretion of misfolded cytosolic proteins from mammalian cells is independent of chaperone-mediated autophagy.In eukaryotic cells  elimination of misfolded proteins is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and cell viability. Misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) is a protein quality-control mechanism that exports misfolded cytosolic proteins via a compartment characteristic of late endosomes  but how cytosolic proteins enter this compartment is unclear. Because chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a known mechanism that imports cytosolic proteins bearing a specific CMA motif to lysosomes for degradation and because late endosomes and lysosomes overlap significantly in mammalian cells  we determined here whether CMA is involved in targeting protein cargoes to the lumen of late endosomes in MAPS. Using HEK293T and COS-7 cells and immunoblotting and -staining and coimmunoprecipitation methods  we show that  unlike CMA  the secretion of misfolded proteins in MAPS does not require cargo unfolding  is inhibited by serum starvation  and is not dependent on the CMA motif in cargo. Intriguingly  knockdown of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)  which consists of three isoforms  including a variant proposed to form a protein channel on lysosomes for CMA  attenuated MAPS. However  this could not be attributed to the proposed channel function of the LAMP2a isoform because overexpression of a cytosolic MAPS stimulator  DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5)  fully rescued the secretion defect associated with LAMP2 deficiency. We conclude that  in MAPS  cargoes use a CMA-independent mechanism to enter a nondegradative prelysosomal compartment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nrf2 promotes progression of non-small cell lung cancer through activating autophagy.The transcription factor  NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and autophagy have been implicated in the oxidative-stress response during tumor evolution. However  few studies focus on crosstalk between Nrf2 and autophagy in cancer progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein  we evaluated the effect of Nrf2 on autophagy in NSCLC and their role in development of NSCLC. Effect of Nrf2 on overal survival (OS) of NSCLC patients were evaluated. Cell biological behaviors in response to Nrf2 were evaluated by MTT  colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Effect of 3-MA (a classical inhibitor of autophagy) on 95D-Nrf2 cells was also analyzed using flow cytometry. After up/down-regulating Nrf2 in NSCLC cell lines  expression of autophagy-related proteins were evaluated with western blot analysis. The results revealed that Nrf2 was an independent prognositc factor negtively associated with OS of NSCLC patients. Elevated Nrf2 expression promotes NSCLC progression  enhancing the escape of tumor cells from apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Double staining with Annexin V-APC and 7-AAD showed that the proportions of apoptotic cells in 95D-Nrf2 cells were gradually increased after the addition of 3-MA. Importently  Nrf2 induced autophagosome formation and enhanced autophagic activity  which subsequently inhibits NSCLC cell apoptosis. In conclusion  our present study demonstrates that Nrf2 promotes progression of non-small cell lung cancer through activating autophagy. It provides novel insights into Nrf2-mediated of cell proliferation in NSCLC and may facilitate therapeutic development against NSCLC.,Autophagy_notLIR
The destruction box is involved in the degradation of the NTE family proteins by the proteasome.Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and NTE-related esterase (NRE) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored proteins belonging to the NTE protein family. NTE and NRE are degraded by macroautophagy and by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However  the regulation of NTE and NRE by proteasome has not been well understood. Western blotting showed that the deletion of the regulatory region of NTE and NRE led to protein accumulation compared with that of the corresponding wild-type proteins. Further  deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the destruction (D) box was required for the proteasomal degradation of NTE and NRE. However  unlike the deletion of the regulatory region  the deletion of the D box did not affect the subcellular localisation of NTE or NRE or disrupt the ER. Moreover  the deletion of the D box or the regulatory region of NTE has similar inhibitory effects on cell growth  which are greater than those produced by the full-length NTE. Here  for the first time  we show that the D box is involved in the regulation of NTE family proteins by the proteasome but not in their subcellular localisation. In addition  these results suggest that the NTE overexpression-mediated inhibition of cell growth is related to active protein levels but not to its ER disruption effect.,Autophagy_notLIR
Modulating cancer cell survival by targeting intracellular cholesterol transport.Demand for cholesterol is high in certain cancers making them potentially sensitive to therapeutic strategies targeting cellular cholesterol homoeostasis. A potential approach involves disruption of intracellular cholesterol transport  which occurs in Niemann-Pick disease as a result of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency. Hence  a class of lysosomotropic compounds that were identified as functional ASM inhibitors (FIASMAs) might exhibit chemotherapeutic activity by disrupting cancer cell cholesterol homoeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Salinomycin induced ROS results in abortive autophagy and leads to regulated necrosis in glioblastoma.Glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor. Even with aggressive treatment  prognosis for patients is poor. One characteristic of glioblastoma cells is its intrinsic resistance to apoptosis. Therefore  drugs that induce alternative cell deaths could be interesting to evaluate as alternative therapeutic candidates for glioblastoma. Salinomycin (SLM) was identified through a chemical screening as a promising anticancer drug  but its mechanism of cell death remains unclear. In the present work we set out to elucidate how SLM causes cell death in glioblastoma cell lines (both established cell lines and brain tumor stem cell lines)  aiming to find a potential antitumor candidate. In addition  we sought to determine the mechanism of action of SLM so that this mechanism can be can be exploited in the fight against cancer. Our data showed that SLM induces a potent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress followed by the trigger of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and an aberrant autophagic flux that culminated in necrosis due to mitochondria and lysosomal alterations. Of importance  the aberrant autophagic flux was orchestrated by the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Alleviation of ROS production restored the autophagic flux. Altogether our data suggest that in our system the oxidative stress blocks the autophagic flux through lipid oxidation. Importantly  oxidative stress could be instructing the type of cell death in SLM-treated cells  suggesting that cell death modality is a dynamic concept which depends on the cellular stresses and the cellular mechanism activated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pathophysiological mechanisms linking F-box only protein 7 (FBXO7) and Parkinson's disease (PD).Mutations of F-box only protein 7 (FBXO7) gene are associated with a severe form of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson's disease (PD) (PARK15) with clinical features of Parkinsonian-Pyramidal syndrome (PPS). FBXO7 is an adaptor protein in SCF<sup>FBXO7</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that recognizes and mediates degradative or non-degradative ubiquitination of substrates. The FBXO7 protein can regulate cell cycle  proliferation  mitochondrial and proteasome functions via interactions with multiple target proteins. Five PARK15-linked FBXO7 gene mutations and several PD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified so far. WT FBXO7 proteins possess dual protective and deleterious functions  whereas PARK15-linked FBXO7 mutants are toxic. FBXO7 is a stress response protein and stress challenges can promote translocation of FBXO7 protein from nucleus into mitochondria and even form deleterious protein aggregate in mitochondria. FBXO7 mutants aggravate protein aggregation in mitochondria and inhibit mitophagy. The pathological mechanisms concerning FBXO7-relevant protein aggregation  mitochondria impairment  reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitophagy modulation in PARK15 pathogenesis are highlighted and discussed in the current review.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy is increased following either pharmacological or genetic silencing of mGluR5 signaling in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurotoxicity mediated by the accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) oligomers  causing neuronal loss and progressive cognitive decline. Genetic deletion or chronic pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 by the negative allosteric modulator CTEP  rescues cognitive function and reduces Aβ aggregation in both APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mouse models of AD. In late onset neurodegenerative diseases  such as AD  defects arise at different stages of the autophagy pathway. Here  we show that mGluR5 cell surface expression is elevated in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice. This is accompanied by reduced autophagy (accumulation of p62) as the consequence of increased ZBTB16 expression and reduced ULK1 activity  as we have previously observed in Huntington's disease (HD). The chronic (12 week) inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice prevents the observed increase in mGluR5 surface expression. In addition  mGluR5 inactivation facilitates the loss of ZBTB16 expression and ULK1 activation as a consequence of ULK-Ser757 dephosphorylation  which promotes the loss of expression of the autophagy marker p62. Moreover  the genetic ablation of mGluR5 in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice activated autophagy via similar mechanisms to pharmacological blockade. This study provides further evidence that mGluR5 overactivation contributes to inhibition of autophagy and can result in impaired clearance of neurotoxic aggregates in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Thus  it provides additional support for the potential of mGluR5 inhibition as a general therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and HD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sirt6 overexpression suppresses senescence and apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells by inducing autophagy in a model of intervertebral disc degeneration.Treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) seeks to prevent senescence and death of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Previous studies have shown that sirt6 exerts potent anti-senescent and anti-apoptotic effects in models of age-related degenerative disease. However  it is not known whether sirt6 protects against IDD. Here  we explored whether sirt6 influenced IDD. The sirt6 level was reduced in senescent human NP cells. Sirt6 overexpression protected against apoptosis and both replicative and stress-induced premature senescence. Sirt6 also activated NP cell autophagy both in vivo and in vitro. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ)-mediated inhibition of autophagy partially reversed the anti-senescent and anti-apoptotic effects of sirt6  which regulated the expression of degeneration-associated proteins. In vivo  sirt6 overexpression attenuated IDD. Together  the data showed that sirt6 attenuated cell senescence  and reduced apoptosis  by triggering autophagy that ultimately ameliorated IDD. Thus  sirt6 may be a novel therapeutic target for IDD treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aminoglutethimide-induced lysosomal changes in adrenal gland in mice.Aminoglutethimide is a steroidogenesis inhibitor and inhibits a cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone in mitochondria. We investigated histopathological changes induced by 5-day administration of AG in mice. Cytoplasmic vacuoles of various sizes and single cell necrosis were found in zona fasciculata cells in AG-treated mice. Some vacuoles were positive for adipophilin  whereas others were positive for lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 on immunohistochemical staining  indicating they were enlarged lipid droplets and lysosomes  respectively. Electron microscopy revealed enlarged lysosomes containing damaged mitochondria and lamellar bodies in zona fasciculata cells  and they were considered to reflect the intracellular protein degradation processes  mitophagy and lipophagy. From these results  we showed that AG induces excessive lipid accumulation and mitochondrial damage in zona fasciculata cells  which leads to an accelerated lysosomal degradation in mice.,Autophagy_notLIR

Extracellular lumican augments cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells via autophagy inhibition.Lumican  an extracellular matrix proteoglycan overexpressed by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDACs)  drives the formation of a tumor-specific microenvironment. We recently showed that extracellular lumican inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth and is associated with prolonged survival after surgery. Here we investigated the role of extracellular lumican in chemotherapy-mediated cancer therapy. Lumican secretion was increased by chemotherapeutic agents in PDAC  and especially in PSCs  and appeared to be linked to the extent of cells' response to chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition. In multiple PDAC models  including cell lines  patient-derived xenografts and lumican knockout mice  lumican significantly increased antitumor effect of chemotherapy. This effect was associated with DNA damage  apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability  glucose consumption  lactate production and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. In PDAC cells  chemotherapeutic agents triggered autophagosome formation and increased LC3 expression through the reactive oxygen species-mediated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of gemcitabine-induced autophagy in cancer cells by treatment with AMPK inhibitor compound C  lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine or autophagy inhibitor 3MA enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis  suggesting that autophagy is a protective cellular response to gemcitabine treatment. Importantly  lumican dramatically decreased AMPK activity  inhibiting chemotherapy-induced autophagy in both in vitro and in vivo PDAC models. Co-treatment of PDAC cells with lumican and gemcitabine increased mitochondrial damage  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytochrome c release  indicating that lumican-induced disruption of mitochondrial function may be the mechanism of sensitization to gemcitabine. Together  our findings demonstrate that extracellular lumican augments cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in PDAC cells through inhibition of chemotherapeutic agent-induced autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
MiR-1303 Regulates Mycobacteria Induced Autophagy by Targeting Atg2B.MicroRNAs are emerging post-transcriptional regulators of gene expressions in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In mycobacteria infection  autophagy plays an important role in innate defense mechanism and is tightly regulated by the autophagy-related proteins. Here  we show that Atg2B is involved in the regulation of mycobacteria-induced autophagy. MiR-1303  which function is not defined yet  is found to negatively regulate mycobacteria-induced Atg2B protein production  ultimately down-regulate mycobacteria-induced autophagy. MiR-1303 production is shown to be upregulated during BCG infection and its production is regulated by PI3K and NFκB. It is also demonstrated that miR-1303 targets putative target sites on Atg2B and possibly represses its translation.,Autophagy_notLIR

Nrf2-Mediated Cardiac Maladaptive Remodeling and Dysfunction in a Setting of Autophagy Insufficiency.Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) appears to exert either a protective or detrimental effect on the heart; however  the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein  we uncovered a novel mechanism for turning off the Nrf2-mediated cardioprotection and switching on Nrf2-mediated cardiac dysfunction. In a murine model of pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction via transverse aortic arch constriction  knockout of Nrf2 enhanced myocardial necrosis and death rate during an initial stage of cardiac adaptation when myocardial autophagy function is intact. However  knockout of Nrf2 turned out to be cardioprotective throughout the later stage of cardiac maladaptive remodeling when myocardial autophagy function became insufficient. Transverse aortic arch constriction -induced activation of Nrf2 was dramatically enhanced in the heart with impaired autophagy  which is induced by cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of autophagy-related gene (Atg)5. Notably  Nrf2 activation coincided with the upregulation of angiotensinogen (Agt) only in the autophagy-impaired heart after transverse aortic arch constriction. Agt5 and Nrf2 gene loss-of-function approaches in combination with Jak2 and Fyn kinase inhibitors revealed that suppression of autophagy inactivated Jak2 and Fyn and nuclear translocation of Fyn  while enhancing nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and Nrf2-driven Agt expression in cardiomyocytes. Taken together  these results indicate that the pathophysiological consequences of Nrf2 activation are closely linked with the functional integrity of myocardial autophagy during cardiac remodeling. When autophagy is intact  Nrf2 is required for cardiac adaptive responses; however  autophagy impairment most likely turns off Fyn-operated Nrf2 nuclear export thus activating Nrf2-driven Agt transcription  which exacerbates cardiac maladaptation leading to dysfunction.,Autophagy_notLIR
A tumor-targeting probe based on a mitophagy process for live imaging.A glucosamine modified near-infrared cyanine dye CyT sensitive to pH was synthesized.

Moreover  due to the introduction of glucosamine groups  this fluorescent probe can be applied for tumor targeted imaging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cardioprotective Effects of Serca2a Overexpression Against Ischemiareperfusion- induced Injuries in Rats.The aim of the present study was to assess how genetically increased Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Serca2a) expression affects cardiac injury after Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) exposure and the related mechanisms involved.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy Induction Protects Against 7-Oxysterol-induced Cell Death via Lysosomal Pathway and Oxidative Stress.7-Oxysterols are major toxic components in oxidized low-density lipoprotein and human atheroma lesions  which cause lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cell death. Autophagy may function as a survival mechanism in this process. Here  we investigated whether 7-oxysterols mixed in an atheroma-relevant proportion induce autophagy  whether autophagy induction influences 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death  and the underlying mechanisms  by focusing on cellular lipid levels  oxidative stress  and LMP in 7-oxysterol-treated macrophages. We found that 7-oxysterols induced cellular lipid accumulation  autophagy dysfunction  and cell death in the form of both apoptosis and necrosis. Exposure to 7-oxysterols induced autophagic vacuole synthesis in the form of increased autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II) and autophagic vacuole formation. This led to an accumulation of p62  indicating a reduction in autophagic vacuole degradation. Importantly  autophagy induction significantly reduced 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death by diminishing LMP and oxidative stress. Moreover  autophagy induction minimized cellular lipid accumulation induced by 7-oxysterols. These findings highlight the importance of autophagy in combating cellular stress  LMP  and cell death in atherosclerosis. Therefore  activation of the autophagy pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for prevention of necrotic core formation in atherosclerotic lesions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Discovery of Potent and Selective Inhibitors of Cdc2-Like Kinase 1 (CLK1) as a New Class of Autophagy Inducers.Autophagy inducers represent new promising agents for the treatment of a wide range of medical illnesses. However  safe autophagy inducers for clinical applications are lacking. Inhibition of cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) was recently found to efficiently induce autophagy. Unfortunately  most of the known CLK1 inhibitors have unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein  we report the discovery of a series of new CLK1 inhibitors containing the 1H-[1 2 3]triazolo[4 5-c]quinoline scaffold. Among them  compound 25 was the most potent and selective  with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2 nM against CLK1. The crystal structure of CLK1 complexed with compound 25 was solved  and the potency and kinase selectivity of compound 25 were interpreted. Compound 25 was able to induce autophagy in in vitro assays and displayed significant hepatoprotective effects in the acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury mouse model. Collectively  due to its potency and selectivity  compound 25 could be used as a chemical probe or agent in future mechanism-of-action or autophagy-related disease therapy studies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Suppression of StarD7 promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress and induces ROS production.StarD7 is an intracellular lipid transport protein identified as up-regulated in the choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cell line. StarD7 facilitates the delivery of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to the mitochondria  and StarD7 knockdown causes a reduction in phospholipid synthesis. Since inhibition of PC synthesis may lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress we hypothesized that StarD7 may be involved in maintaining cell homeostasis. Here  we examined the effect of StarD7 silencing on ER stress response and on the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. StarD7 knockdown induced alterations in mitochondria and ER morphology. These changes were accompanied with an ER stress response as determined by increased expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)  calnexin  glucose regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (Grp78/BiP)  protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) as well as the phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2  subunit 1α (p-eIF2α). Additionally  a downregulation of the tumor suppressor p53 by a degradation mechanism was observed in StarD7 siRNA cells. Furthermore  StarD7 silencing induced ROS generation and reduced cell viability after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Decreased expression of StarD7 was associated to increased levels of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and catalase enzymes as well as in catalase enzymatic activity. Finally  no changes in levels of autophagy and apoptosis markers were observed in StarD7 siRNA treated cells respect to control cells. Taken together  these results indicate that StarD7 contributes to modulate cellular redox homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field with Temozolomide Can Elicit an Epigenetic Pro-apoptotic Effect on Glioblastoma T98G Cells.Treatment with pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) is emerging as an interesting therapeutic option for patients with cancer. The literature has demonstrated that low-frequency/low-energy electromagnetic fields do not cause predictable effects on DNA; however  they can epigenetically act on gene expression. The aim of the present work was to study a possible epigenetic effect of a PEMF  mediated by miRNAs  on a human glioblastoma cell line (T98G). We tested a PEMF (maximum magnetic induction  2 mT; frequency  75 Hz) that has been demonstrated to induce autophagy in glioblastoma cells. In particular  we studied the effect of PEMF on the expression of genes involved in cancer progression and a promising synergistic effect with temozolomide  a frequently used drug to treat glioblastoma multiforme. We found that electromagnetic stimulation in combination with temozolomide can elicit an epigenetic pro-apoptotic effect in the chemo- and radioresistant T98G glioblastoma cell line.,Autophagy_notLIR
Xanthohumol induces paraptosis of leukemia cells through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway.Xanthohumol as a natural polyphenol demonstrates an anticancer activity  but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study  we showed that xanthohumol (XN) induces paraptosis of leukemia cells. The paraptosis is one cell death which is characterized by dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or mitochondria. The results demonstrated that XN treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and triggered extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation of HL-60 leukemia cells  but it did not cause the cleavage of caspase-3 protein or apoptosis. In contrast  XN treatment resulted in LC3-II accumulation through blocking of autophagosome maturation. Interestingly  the induction of cytoplasmic vacuolization by XN is not associated with autophagy modulated by XN  therefore  XN-induced cell death of HL-60 leukemia cells is not the classical apoptotic cell death. Intriguingly  XN treatment triggered the dilatation of endoplasma reticulum (ER) and induced ER stress by upregulating C/EBP homologous protein and unfolded protein response regulator Grp78/Bip. Furthermore  XN treatment triggered p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and its specific inhibitor inhibited the paraptosis of HL-60 leukemia cells by XN. In conclusion  we for the first time demonstrated that XN treatment can induce paraptosis of leukemia cells through activation of p38 MAPK signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Septins are involved at the early stages of macroautophagy in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.Autophagy is a conserved cellular degradation pathway wherein double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes capture long-lived proteins  and damaged or superfluous organelles  and deliver them to the lysosome for degradation. Septins are conserved GTP-binding proteins involved in many cellular processes  including phagocytosis and the autophagy of intracellular bacteria  but no role in general autophagy was known. In budding yeast  septins polymerize into ring-shaped arrays of filaments required for cytokinesis. In an unbiased genetic screen and in subsequent targeted analysis  we found autophagy defects in septin mutants. Upon autophagy induction  pre-assembled septin complexes relocalized to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) where they formed non-canonical septin rings at PAS. Septins also colocalized with autophagosomes  where they physically interacted with the autophagy proteins Atg8 and Atg9. When autophagosome degradation was blocked in septin-mutant cells  fewer autophagic structures accumulated  and an autophagy mutant defective in early stages of autophagosome biogenesis (<i>atg1Δ</i>)  displayed decreased septin localization to the PAS. Our findings support a role for septins in the early stages of budding yeast autophagy  during autophagosome formation.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Lactate Dehydrogenase Sequestration Assay - A Simple and Reliable Method to Determine Bulk Autophagic Sequestration Activity in Mammalian Cells.Bulk autophagy is characterized by the sequestration of large portions of cytoplasm into double/multi-membrane structures termed autophagosomes. Here a simple protocol to monitor this process is described. Moreover  typical results and experimental validation of the method under autophagy-inducing conditions in various types of cultured mammalian cells are provided. During bulk autophagy  autophagosomes sequester cytosol  and thereby also soluble cytosolic proteins  alongside other autophagic cargo. LDH is a stable and highly abundant  soluble cytosolic enzyme that is non-selectively sequestered into autophagosomes. The amount of LDH sequestration therefore reflects the amount of bulk autophagic sequestration. To efficiently and accurately determine LDH sequestration in cells  we employ an electrodisruption-based fractionation protocol that effectively separates sedimentable from cytosolic LDH  followed by measurement of enzymatic activity in sedimentable fractions versus whole-cell samples. Autophagic sequestration is determined by subtracting the proportion of sedimentable LDH in untreated cells from that in treated cells. The advantage of the LDH sequestration assay is that it gives a quantitative measure of the autophagic sequestration of endogenous cargo  as opposed to other methods that either involve ectopic expression of sequestration probes or semi-quantitative protease protection analyses of autophagy markers or receptors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Microarray and genetic analysis reveals that csa-miR159b plays a critical role in abscisic acid-mediated heat tolerance in grafted cucumber plants.Root-shoot communication plays a vital role in plant growth  development and adaptation to environmental stimuli. Grafting-induced stress tolerance is associated with the induction of plentiful stress-related genes and proteins; the mechanism involved  however  remains obscure. Here  we show that the enhanced tolerance against heat stress in cucumber plants with luffa as rootstock was accompanied with an increased accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA)  down-regulation of a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) but up-regulation of their target genes and CsHSP70 accumulation in the shoots. Significantly  luffa rootstock and foliar application of ABA both down-regulated csa-miR159b and up-regulated its target mRNAs CsGAMYB1 and CsMYB29-like and CsHSP70 accumulation in cucumber  while ectopic expression of csa-miR159b led to decreased heat tolerance  AtMYB33 transcript and AtHSP70 accumulation in Arabidopsis plants. Taken together  our results suggest that root-originated signals such as ABA could alter miRNAs in the shoots  which have a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of the stress-responsive genes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of atorvastatin on autophagy in skeletal muscles of diabetic rats.Atorvastatin is usually used to decrease the amount of fatty substances in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Rapamycin inhibits oxidative/nitrosative stress and enhances angiogenesis in high glucose-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells: Role of autophagy.Chronic hyperglycemia is a potent risk factor of abnormal angiogenesis with various tissue diseases. Autophagy  as an alternative cell response  is mostly generated by a vast array of insults. Applying autophagic response contributes to normal cell retrieval circumstance during various insults. We aimed to show whether stimulation/inhibition of autophagy could reduce or exacerbate oxidative status and angiogenic potential in endothelial cells after exposure to 30mM glucose. HUVECs were incubated with the combined regime of 100nM Rapamycin and 30mM glucose over a period of 72h. The effect of rapamycin on cell viability  malondialdehyde levels  and nitric oxide were monitored by convenient assays. Intracellular ROS level was measured by flow cytometric analysis and DCFDA. HUVECs migration and angiogenic properties were assessed using scratch test and tubulogenesis assay. The expression of autophagic modulators LC3  Becline-1 and P62 was measured by using western blotting. Data showed 30mM glucose reduced cell viability  migration and in vitro tubulogenesis and level of ROS and nitric oxide were found to increased (p<0.05). Rapamycin had potential to increase cell survival and significantly decreased the total levels of oxidative stress markers after cell exposure to 30mM glucose (p<0.05). Rapamycin potentially improved the detrimental effect of 30mM glucose on cell migration and tubulogenesis capacity (p<0.05). Effective autophagic response was stimulated by rapamycin by increasing beclin-1  and the LC3-II/I ratio and reducing intracellular P62 level (p<0.05)  resulting in the improvement of cell health and function. Together  rapamycin protected HUVECs from damages caused by high glucose concentration. This effect was possibly mediated by autophagy-dependent pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
An impaired biliary bicarbonate umbrella may be involved in dysregulated autophagy in primary biliary cholangitis.Dysregulated autophagy may be a central player in trehe pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) by inducing autoimmune processes via abnormal expression of mitochondrial antigens such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  E2 component (PDC-E2) and also by inducing cellular senescence in biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in bile duct lesions in PBC. We examined the association of an impaired "biliary bicarbonate umbrella" due to dysfunction of anion exchanger 2 (AE2) with dysregulated autophagy and cellular senescence in PBC. The expression of AE2 was examined in cultured BECs treated with bile acids such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)  various cytokines (IL-4  IL-13  IFNγ  TNFα  TGFβ)  and serum deprivation. The effect of AE2 knockdown using siRNA on autophagy  cell surface expression of PDC-E2  and cellular senescence was also examined. The expression of AE2 and its association with autophagy-related markers and senescent markers p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup> were immunohistochemically determined in livers taken from the patients with PBC (n = 50) and 69 control diseased and normal livers. The expression of AE2 was significantly induced in the cultured BECs shortly treated with GCDC and other stresses  whereas it was significantly decreased in senescent BECs induced by GCDC and other stresses (p < 0.05). Dysregulated autophagy  cell surface expression of PDC-E2  and cellular senescence were significantly increased by knockdown of AE2 (p < 0.05). The expression of AE2 was significantly decreased in cholangitis in PBC  compared to control livers (p < 0.05). The decreased expression of AE2 was correlated with dysregulated autophagy  abnormal expression of PDC-E2  and cellular senescence in bile duct lesions in PBC. In conclusion  an impaired biliary bicarbonate umbrella may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC by inducing dysregulated autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
An Insight into Cotton Leaf Curl Multan Betasatellite  the Most Important Component of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease Complex.Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is one of the most economically important diseases and is a constraint to cotton production in major producers  Pakistan and India. CLCuD is caused by monopartite plant viruses belonging to the family <i>Geminiviridae</i> (genus <i>Begomovirus</i>)  in association with an essential  disease-specific satellite  <i>Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite</i> (CLCuMuB) belonging to a newly-established family <i>Tolecusatellitidae</i> (genus <i>Betasatellite</i>). CLCuMuB has a small genome (ca. 1350 nt) with a satellite conserved region  an adenine-rich region and a single gene that encodes for a multifunctional βC1 protein. CLCuMuB βC1 protein has a major role in pathogenicity and symptom determination  and alters several host cellular functions like autophagy  ubiquitination  and suppression of gene silencing  to assist CLCuD infectivity. Efficient <i>trans</i>-replication ability of CLCuMuB with several monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses  is also associated with the rapid evolution and spread of CLCuMuB. In this article we comprehensively reviewed the role of CLCuMuB in CLCuD  focusing on the βC1 functions and its interactions with host proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bortezomib enhances radiosensitivity in oral cancer through inducing autophagy-mediated TRAF6 oncoprotein degradation.Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor that may occur anywhere within the oral cavity. The survival rate of OSCC patients has not improved over the past decades due to its heterogeneous etiology  genetic aberrations  and treatment outcomes. We investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in OSCC cells treated with bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) combined with irradiation (IR) treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) suppresses hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major risk factor for the development of chronic liver disease. The disease typically progresses from chronic HCV to fibrosis  cirrhosis  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  and death. Chronic inflammation associated with HCV infection is implicated in cirrhosis and HCC  but the molecular players and signaling pathways contributing to these processes remain largely unknown. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a molecule of interest in HCV-associated HCC because it has critical roles in virus-  Toll-like receptor (TLR)-  and IFN-induced signaling pathways. IRF5 is also a tumor suppressor  and its expression is dysregulated in several human cancers. Here  we present first evidence that IRF5 expression and signaling are modulated during HCV infection. Using HCV infection of human hepatocytes and cells with autonomously replicating HCV RNA  we found that levels of IRF5 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated. Of note  reporter assays indicated that IRF5 re-expression inhibited HCV protein translation and RNA replication. Gene expression analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of cancer pathway mediators and autophagy proteins rather than in cytokines between IRF5- and empty vector-transfected HCV replicon cells. IRF5 re-expression induced apoptosis via loss in mitochondrial membrane potential  down-regulated autophagy  and inhibited hepatocyte cell migration/invasion. Analysis of clinical HCC specimens supports a pathologic role for IRF5 in HCV-induced HCC  as IRF5 expression was down-regulated in livers from HCV-positive <i>versus</i> HCV-negative HCC patients or healthy donor livers. These results identify IRF5 as an important suppressor of HCV replication and HCC pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
SLC27A4 regulate ATG4B activity and control reactions to chemotherapeutics-induced autophagy in human lung cancer cells.Autophagy is a highly conserved self-digestion process to promote cell survival in response to nutrient starvation and other metabolic stresses in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of this system is linked with numerous human diseases  including cancers. ATG4B  a cysteine protease required for autophagy  cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 family proteins to reveal a C-terminal glycine which is necessary for ATG8 proteins conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and insertion to autophagosome precursor membranes. However  the mechanism governing the protein stability of ATG4B in human cancer cells is not fully understood. In this study  tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry (TAP/MS) were applied to the investigation of the interaction between ATG4B and potential candidate proteins. Then  co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST-pull down assays indicated that the candidate protein-SLC27A4 directly interacts with ATG4B in lung cancer cell lines. Intriguingly  we also found that ATG4B protein expression was increased in parallel with SLC27A4 in lung cancer cell lines as well as lung tumor tissues. However  relevant functional research of SLC27A4 in autophagy or oncotherapy has not been investigated before. In this study  we hypothesized that SLC27A4 might act as a mediator of ATG4B  in some respects  through the protein binding directly. Further  we found that the high expression level of SLC7A4 increased the ATG4B stability and was conducive to rapid reaction to everolimus (RAD001)-induced autophagy in human lung cancer cells. As expected  the results showed that SLC27A4 could help to maintain the protein stability and intracellular concentration of ATG4B  thereby triggering rapid autophagy through releasing ATG4B to cytoplasm under conditions of reduced nutrient availability or during stress of chemotherapy in lung cancer cells. Reduced SLC27A4 by si-RNA also showed the enhanced therapeutic efficiency of everolimus  doxorubicin  and cisplatin in human lung cancer cell lines. Collectively  this study may help researchers better understand the mechanism of autophagy vitality in human cancers and SLC27A4/ATG4B complex might act as a new potential therapeutic target of lung tumor chemotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
UBE2L6/UBCH8 and ISG15 attenuate autophagy in esophageal cancer cells.Esophageal cancer remains a poor prognosis cancer due to advanced stage of presentation and drug resistant disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms influencing response to chemotherapy  we examined genes that are differentially expressed between drug sensitive  apoptosis competent esophageal cancer cells (OE21  OE33  FLO-1) and those which are more resistant and do not exhibit apoptosis (KYSE450 and OE19). Members of the ISG15 (ubiquitin-like) protein modification pathway  including UBE2L6 and ISG15  were found to be more highly expressed in the drug sensitive cell lines. In this study  we evaluated the contribution of these proteins to the response of drug sensitive cells. Depletion of UBE2L6 or ISG15 with siRNA did not influence caspase-3 activation or nuclear fragmentation following treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We assessed autophagy by analysis of LC3II expression and Cyto-ID staining. Depletion of either ISG15 or UBE2L6 resulted in enhanced endogenous autophagic flux. An increase in autophagic flux was also observed following treatment with cytotoxic drugs (5-FU  rapamycin). In ISG15 depleted cells  this increase in autophagy was associated with improved recovery of drug treated cells. In contrast  UBE2L6 depleted cells  did not show enhanced recovery. UBE2L6 may therefore influence additional targets that limit the pro-survival effect of ISG15 depletion. These data identify UBE2L6 and ISG15 as novel inhibitors of autophagy  with the potential to influence chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Non-developmental dimensions of adult regeneration in Hydra.An essential dimension of 3D regeneration in adult animals is developmental  with the formation of organizers from somatic tissues. These organizers produce signals that recruit surrounding cells and drive the restoration of the missing structures (organs  appendages  body parts). However  even in animals with a high regenerative potential  this developmental potential is not sufficient to achieve regeneration as homeostatic conditions at the time of injury need to be "pro-regenerative". In Hydra  we identified four distinct homeostatic properties that provide a pro-regenerative framework and we discuss here how these non-developmental properties impact regeneration. First  both the epithelial and the interstitial-derived cells are highly plastic along the animal body  a plasticity that offers several routes to achieve regeneration. Second  the abundant stocks of continuously self-renewing adult stem cells form a constitutive pro-blastema in the central body column  readily activated upon bisection. Third  the autophagy machinery in epithelial cells guarantees a high level of fitness and adaptation to detrimental environmental conditions  as evidenced by the loss of regeneration in animals where autophagy is dysfunctional. Fourth  the extracellular matrix  named mesoglea in Hydra  provides a dynamically-patterned environment where the molecular and mechanical signals induced by injury get translated into a regenerative process. We claim that these homeostatic pro-regenerative features contribute to define the high regenerative potential of adult Hydra.,Autophagy_notLIR
Baicalin attenuates liver hypoxia/reoxygenation injury by inducing autophagy.The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of baicalin on liver hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury and the possible mechanism involved. A cellular H/R model was established and cells were treated with 50  100 and 200 µmol/l baicalin. Following reoxygenation for 6 h  cell viability  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)  Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)  caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 were assessed. Furthermore  levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers binding of immunoglobulin protein (BIP) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and autophagy markers microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3) and beclin 1 were measured. To confirm the involvement of autophagy in baicalin-mediated attenuation of H/R injury  the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was administered. The results revealed that baicalin administration increased cell viability and decreased LDH levels  most notably at a dosage of 100 µmol/l. Baicalin pretreatment also downregulated the expression of caspase 3  cleaved caspase 3 and Bax  while upregulating the expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore  BIP and CHOP were decreased while LC3 and beclin-1 were significantly increased by baicalin pretreatment. Inhibiting autophagy using 3-MA  resulted in a significant decrease in LC3-II  beclin-1 and LDH  as well as increase in the expression of BIP  CHOP  caspase 3  cleaved caspase 3 and Bax. Bcl-2 and cell viability were also decreased. In conclusion  the results of the present study indicate that baicalin exerts a protective effect on liver H/R injury and this may be achieved via the induction of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Toxic Effect of ALLN on Primary Rat Retinal Neurons.N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN)  an inhibitor of proteasomes and calpain  is widely used to reduce proteasomes or calpain-mediated cell death in rodents. However  ALLN is toxic to retinal neurons to some extent. At the concentration of 10 μM  ALLN is non-toxic to cortical neurons  but induces cell death of retinal neurons in vitro. The tolerance concentration of ALLN for retinal neurons is unclear  and the precise mechanism of cell death induced by ALLN remains elusive. In this study  we investigated the toxic effect of ALLN on primary retinal neurons. The 3-(4 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed no significant changes of cell viability at 1 μM but decreased cell viability after treatment of ALLN at 2.5  5  and 7.5 μM. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was highly elevated and propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells were significantly increased at 2.5  5  and 7.5 μM after all treatment times. Moreover  the protein levels of caspase-3 were up-regulated at 5 and 7.5 μM after 12 and 24 h of ALLN treatment. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was raised and Annexin V-positive cells were increased at 5 and 7.5 μM after 12 and 24 h of ALLN treatment. However  there were no significant changes in either the ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) II/LC3 I or monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Our data clearly show that at the concentrations equal to and higher than 2.5 μM  ALLN may induce cell death of primary retinal neurons by necrosis and apoptosis  but not autophagy. These suggest that primary retinal neurons are more susceptible to ALLN treatment and provide a possible mechanism for the cell death of ALLN-sensitive cells in ALLN injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Thyroid hormone-mediated autophagy and mitochondrial turnover in NAFLD.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing silent epidemic that is present in both developed and developing countries. Initially thought as a benign deposition of lipids in the liver  it now has been shown to be a major risk factor for type II diabetes and one of the leading causes of cirrhosis. Recent findings suggest that dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy play critical roles in the hepatocyte injury and insulin resistance of NAFLD. Thyroid hormone (TH) is a major stimulator of hepatic autophagy and mitochondrial function. Decreased TH action has been associated with NAFLD in man. In this review  we highlight some of the new discoveries that demonstrate the roles of TH in hepatic mitochondrial homeostasis via mitophagy and their implications for NAFLD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Local detection of PtdIns3P at autophagosome biogenesis membrane platforms.Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is a key player of membrane trafficking regulation  mostly synthesized by the PIK3C3 lipid kinase. The presence of PtdIns3P on endosomes has been demonstrated; however  the role and dynamics of the pool of PtdIns3P dedicated to macroautophagy/autophagy remains elusive. Here we addressed this question by studying the mobilization of PtdIns3P in time and space during autophagosome biogenesis. We compared different dyes known to specifically detect PtdIns3P by fluorescence microscopy analysis  based on PtdIns3P-binding FYVE and PX domains  and show that these transfected dyes induce defects in endosomal dynamics as well as artificial and sustained autophagosome formation. In contrast  indirect use of recombinant FYVE enabled us to track and discriminate endosomal and autophagosomal pools of PtdIns3P. We used this method to analyze localization and dynamics of PtdIns3P subdomains on the endoplasmic reticulum  at sites of pre-autophagosome associated protein recruitment such as the PtdIns3P-binding ZFYVE1/DFCP1 and WIPI2 autophagy regulators. This approach thus revealed the presence of a specific pool of PtdIns3P at the site where autophagosome assembly is initiated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anti-oxidant effect of bergamot polyphenolic fraction counteracts doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy: Role of autophagy and c-kit<sup>pos</sup>CD45<sup>neg</sup>CD31<sup>neg</sup> cardiac stem cell activation.Doxorubicin (DOXO) is one of the most widely used antineoplastic drugs. Despite its highly beneficial effects against several malignancies  the clinical use of DOXO is often associated to cardiomyopathy that leads to congestive heart failure. Here we investigated the antioxidant and cardioprotective effects of a polyphenol-rich fraction of citrus bergamot (BPF)  in DOXO-induced cardiac damage in rats. Moreover  we evaluated the effect of BPF on cardiomyocyte survival and resident endogenous cardiac stem/progenitor cell (eCSC) activation. Adult male Wistar rats were i.p. injected with saline (serving as controls  CTRL  n = 10)  BPF (20 mg/kg daily for 14 consecutive days  n = 10)  DOXO (6 doses of 2 5 mg/Kg from day 1 to day 14  n = 10)  and DOXO + BPF (n = 10). Animals were then sacrificed 7 days later (i.e.  at 21 days). DOXO administration reduced cardiac function at 21 days  an adverse effect significantly attenuated in animals receiving DOXO + BPF. No changes were detected in rats receiving just saline or BPF alone. The cardioprotective effect of BPF on DOXO acute toxicity was also associated with a significant antioxidant effect coupled with protective autophagy restoration  and attenuation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reactive hypertrophy. Finally  treatment of rats with BPF prevented eCSCs attrition by DOXO which was followed by a limited but significant increase of newly-formed BrdU<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocytes. In conclusion  BPF reduces DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity by counteracting reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction  thereby restoring protective autophagy and attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and pathologic remodeling. This beneficial effects on the early toxicity of DOXO is associated with enhanced CSCs survival and regenerative potential. Overall these data point to a potential clinical role by diet supplementation with polyphenol-rich fraction of citrus bergamot in counteracting antracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sustained activation of mTORC1 in macrophages increases AMPKα-dependent autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis.The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a well-conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that controls autophagy as well as many other processes such as protein synthesis  cell growth  and metabolism. The activity of mTORC1 is stringently and negatively controlled by the tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 complex (TSC1/2).,Autophagy_notLIR
Different Roles of Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter Complex Subunits in Growth and Infectivity of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>.<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> is the agent of Chagas disease  and the finding that this parasite possesses a mitochondrial calcium uniporter (TcMCU) with characteristics similar to that of mammalian mitochondria was fundamental for the discovery of the molecular nature of MCU in eukaryotes. We report here that ablation of <i>TcMCU</i>  or its paralog <i>TcMCUb</i>  by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 led to a marked decrease in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake without affecting the membrane potential of these cells  whereas overexpression of each gene caused a significant increase in the ability of mitochondria to accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> While <i>TcMCU-</i>knockout (KO) epimastigotes were viable and able to differentiate into trypomastigotes  infect host cells  and replicate normally  ablation of <i>TcMCUb</i> resulted in epimastigotes having an important growth defect  lower rates of respiration and metacyclogenesis  more pronounced autophagy changes under starvation  and significantly reduced infectivity. Overexpression of <i>TcMCUb</i>  in contrast to what was proposed for its mammalian ortholog  did not result in a dominant negative effect on TcMCU.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The finding of a mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> was essential for the discovery of the molecular nature of this transporter in mammals. In this work  we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique that we recently developed for <i>T. cruzi</i> to knock out two components of the uniporter: MCU  the pore subunit  and MCUb  which was proposed as a negative regulator of MCU in human cells. In contrast to what occurs in human cells  MCU is not essential  while MCUb is essential for growth  differentiation  and infectivity; has a bioenergetic role; and does not act as a dominant negative subunit of MCU.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide in Ischemic Stroke and the Emergent Epigenetic Underpinnings.Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) are the key gasotransmitters with an imperious role in the maintenance of cerebrovascular homeostasis. A decline in their levels contributes to endothelial dysfunction that portends ischemic stroke (IS) or cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R). Nevertheless  their exorbitant production during CI/R is associated with exacerbation of cerebrovascular injury in the post-stroke epoch. NO-producing nitric oxide synthases are implicated in IS pathology and their activity is regulated  inter alia  by various post-translational modifications and chromatin-based mechanisms. These account for heterogeneous alterations in NO production in a disease setting like IS. Interestingly  NO per se has been posited as an endogenous epigenetic modulator. Further  there is compelling evidence for an ingenious crosstalk between NO and H<sub>2</sub>S in effecting the canonical (direct) and non-canonical (off-target collateral) functions. In this regard  NO-mediated S-nitrosylation and H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated S-sulfhydration of specific reactive thiols in an expanding array of target proteins are the principal modalities mediating the all-pervasive influence of NO and H<sub>2</sub>S on cell fate in an ischemic brain. An integrated stress response subsuming unfolded protein response and autophagy to cellular stressors like endoplasmic reticulum stress  in part  is entrenched in such signaling modalities that substantiate the role of NO and H<sub>2</sub>S in priming the cells for stress response. The precis presented here provides a comprehension on the multifarious actions of NO and H<sub>2</sub>S and their epigenetic underpinnings  their crosstalk in maintenance of cerebrovascular homeostasis  and their "Janus bifrons" effect in IS milieu together with plausible therapeutic implications.,Autophagy_notLIR

Gene expression profiles of autophagy-related genes in multiple sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an imflammatory disease of central nervous system caused by genetic and environmental factors that remain largely unknown. Autophagy is the process of degradation and recycling of damaged cytoplasmic organelles  macromolecular aggregates  and long-lived proteins. Malfunction of autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases  and autophagy genes may modulate the T cell survival. We aimed to examine the expression levels of autophagy-related genes. The blood samples of 95 unrelated patients (aged 17-65years  37 male  58 female) diagnosed as MS and 95 healthy controls were used to extract the RNA samples. After conversion to single stranded cDNA using polyT priming: the targeted genes were pre-amplified  and 96×78 (samples×primers) qRT-PCR reactions were performed for each primer pair on each sample on a 96.96 array of Fluidigm BioMark™. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls  gene expression levels of ATG16L2  ATG9A  BCL2  FAS  GAA  HGS  PIK3R1  RAB24  RGS19  ULK1  FOXO1  HTT were significantly altered (false discovery rate<0.05). Thus  altered expression levels of several autophagy related genes may affect protein levels  which in turn would influence the activity of autophagy  or most probably  those genes might be acting independent of autophagy and contributing to MS pathogenesis as risk factors. The indeterminate genetic causes leading to alterations in gene expressions require further analysis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Natriuretic peptide receptor A inhibition suppresses gastric cancer development through reactive oxygen species-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death.Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA)  the major receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)  has been implicated in tumorigenesis; however  the role of ANP-NPRA signaling in the development of gastric cancer remains unclear. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that NPRA expression was positively associated with gastric tumor size and cancer stage. NPRA inhibition by shRNA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest  cell death  and autophagy in gastric cancer cells  due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy led to caspase-dependent cell death. Therefore  autophagy induced by NPRA silencing may represent a cytoprotective mechanism. ROS accumulation activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). ROS-mediated activation of JNK inhibited cell proliferation by disturbing cell cycle and decreased cell viability. In addition  AMPK activation promoted autophagy in NPRA-downregulated cancer cells. Overall  our results indicate that the inhibition of NPRA suppresses gastric cancer development and targeting NPRA may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of protective autophagy in anoikis-resistant glioma stem cells by SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin.Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a frequent and aggressive glial tumor  containing a small population of therapy-resistant cells  glioma stem cells (GSCs). Current dogma suggests that tumors regrow from GSCs  and these cells contribute to therapy resistance  poor prognosis  and recurrence; highlighting the importance of GSCs in glioma pathophysiology and therapeutic targeting. Macroautophagy/autophagy-based cellular homeostasis can be changed from pro-survival to pro-cell death by modulating SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin (syndecan binding protein)-mediated signaling. In nonadherent conditions  GSCs display protective autophagy and anoikis-resistance  which correlates with expression of SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin. Conversely  SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin silencing induces autophagic death in GSCs  indicating that SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin regulates protective autophagy in GSCs under anoikis conditions. This process is mediated through phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 accompanied with suppression of high levels of autophagic proteins (ATG5  LAMP1  LC3B) through EGFR signaling. SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin-mediated regulation of BCL2 and EGFR phosphorylation is achieved through PTK2/FAK and PRKC/PKC signaling. When SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin is absent  this protective mechanism is deregulated  leading to highly elevated and sustained levels of autophagy and consequently decreased cell survival. Our recent paper reveals a novel functional link between SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin expression and protective autophagy in GSCs. These new insights into SDCBP/MDA-9/Syntenin-mediated regulation and maintenance of GSCs present leads for developing innovative combinatorial cancer therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Intra-articular delivery of sinomenium encapsulated by chitosan microspheres and photo-crosslinked GelMA hydrogel ameliorates osteoarthritis by effectively regulating autophagy.Reduced expression of autophagy regulators has been observed in pathological cartilage in humans and mice. The present study aimed to investigate the synergistic therapeutic effect of promotion of chondrocyte autophagy via exposure to sinomenium (SIN) encapsulated by chitosan microspheres (CM-SIN) and photo-crosslinked gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel  with the goal of evaluating CM-SIN as a treatment for patients with osteoarthritis. First  we fabricated and characterized GelMA hydrogels and chitosan microspheres. Next  we measured the effect of SIN on cartilage matrix degradation induced by IL1-β in chondrocytes and an ex vivo model. SIN ameliorated the pathological changes induced by IL1-β at least partially through activation of autophagy. Moreover  we surgically induced osteoarthritis in mice  which were injected intra-articularly with CM-SIN and GelMA. Cartilage matrix degradation and chondrocyte autophagy were evaluated 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Treatment with the combination of CM-SIN and GelMA retarded the progression of surgically induced OA. SIN ameliorated cartilage matrix degradation at least partially by inducing autophagy in vivo. Our results demonstrate that injection of the combination of GelMA hydrogel and CM-SIN could be a promising strategy for treating patients with osteoarthritis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sinomenine Attenuates Angiotensin II-Induced Autophagy via Inhibition of P47-Phox Translocation to the Membrane and Influences Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in Podocytes.Sinomenine  a pure alkaloid extracted from the Chinese medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum  and sinomenine hydrochloride (SN) has been successfully used for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and kidney diseases. Autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism used by podocytes and other cells to alleviate the effects of oxidative stress  and angiotensin II (Ang II) significantly promotes podocyte autophagy. However  excessive autophagy may lead to cell death and podocyte depletion. The present study evaluated the effect of SN in podocytes induced by Ang II.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mutant KLF1 in Adult Anemic Nan Mice Leads to Profound Transcriptome Changes and Disordered Erythropoiesis.Anemic Nan mice carry a mutation (E339D) in the second zinc finger of erythroid transcription factor KLF1. Nan-KLF1 fails to bind a subset of normal KLF1 targets and ectopically binds a large set of genes not normally engaged by KLF1  resulting in a corrupted fetal liver transcriptome. Here  we performed RNAseq using flow cytometric-sorted spleen erythroid precursors from adult Nan and WT littermates rendered anemic by phlebotomy to identify global transcriptome changes specific to the Nan Klf1 mutation as opposed to anemia generally. Mutant Nan-KLF1 leads to extensive and progressive transcriptome corruption in adult spleen erythroid precursors such that stress erythropoiesis is severely compromised. Terminal erythroid differentiation is defective in the bone marrow as well. Principle component analysis reveals two major patterns of differential gene expression predicting that defects in basic cellular processes including translation  cell cycle  and DNA repair could contribute to disordered erythropoiesis and anemia in Nan. Significant erythroid precursor stage specific changes were identified in some of these processes in Nan. Remarkably  however  despite expression changes in large numbers of associated genes  most basic cellular processes were intact in Nan indicating that developing red cells display significant physiological resiliency and establish new homeostatic set points in vivo.,Autophagy_notLIR

The mammalian ULK1 complex and autophagy initiation.Autophagy is a vital lysosomal degradation pathway that serves as a quality control mechanism. It rids the cell of damaged  toxic or excess cellular components  which if left to persist could be detrimental to the cell. It also serves as a recycling pathway to maintain protein synthesis under starvation conditions. A key initial event in autophagy is formation of the autophagosome  a unique double-membrane organelle that engulfs the cytosolic cargo destined for degradation. This step is mediated by the serine/threonine protein kinase ULK1 (unc-51-like kinase 1)  which functions in a complex with at least three protein partners: FIP200 (focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa)  ATG (autophagy-related protein) 13 (ATG13)  and ATG101. In this artcile  we focus on the regulation of the ULK1 complex during autophagy initiation. The complex pattern of upstream pathways that converge on ULK1 suggests that this complex acts as a node  converting multiple signals into autophagosome formation. Here  we review our current understanding of this regulation and in turn discuss what happens downstream  once the ULK1 complex becomes activated.,Autophagy_notLIR

The Different Tactics of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus to Evade Innate Immunity.Like all pathogens  foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is recognized by the immune system inducing a heightened immune response mainly mediated by type I and type III IFNs. To overcome the strong antiviral response induced by these cytokines  FMDV has evolved many strategies exploiting each region of its small RNA genome. These include: (a) inhibition of IFN induction at the transcriptional and translational level  (b) inhibition of protein trafficking; (c) blockage of specific post-translational modifications in proteins that regulate innate immune signaling; (d) modulation of autophagy; (e) inhibition of stress granule formation; and (f) <i>in vivo</i> modulation of immune cell function. Here  we summarize and discuss FMDV virulence factors and the host immune footprint that characterize infection in cell culture and in the natural hosts.,Autophagy_notLIR
Polycystin-2 Plays an Essential Role in Glucose Starvation-Induced Autophagy in Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.Autophagy is a process essential for cell survival under stress condition. The patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  which is caused by polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 (PKD2) mutation  display cardiovascular abnormalities and dysregulation in autophagy. However  it is unclear whether PKD2 plays a role in autophagy. In the present study  we explored the functional role of PKD2 in autophagy and apoptosis in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. HES2 hESC line-derived cardiomyocytes (HES2-CMs) were transduced with adenoviral-based PKD2-shRNAs (Ad-PKD2-shRNAs)  and then cultured with normal or glucose-free medium for 3 hours. Autophagy was upregulated in HES2-CMs under glucose starvation  as indicated by increased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II level in immunoblots and increased autophagosome and autolysosome formation. Knockdown of PKD2 reduced the autophagic flux and increased apoptosis under glucose starvation. In Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement  Ad-PKD2-shRNAs reduced caffeine-induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise. Co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assay demonstrated an increased physical interaction of PKD2 with ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) under glucose starvation condition. Furthermore  Ad-PKD2-shRNAs substantially attenuated the starvation-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The present study for the first time demonstrates that PKD2 functions to promote autophagy under glucose starvation  thereby protects cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death. The mechanism may involve PKD2 interaction with RyR2 to alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from sarcoplasmic reticulum  consequently modulating the activity of AMPK and mTOR  resulting in alteration of autophagy and apoptosis.

Dysfunctional autophagy in RPE  a contributing factor in age-related macular degeneration.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and a major cause of blindness in the developed world. Owing to its complexity and the lack of an adequate human model that recapitulates key aspects of the disease  the molecular mechanisms of AMD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we show that cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from AMD donors (AMD RPE) are functionally impaired and exhibit distinct phenotypes compared with RPE cultured from normal donors (normal RPE). Accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen granules  disintegration of mitochondria  and an increase in autophagosomes were observed in AMD RPE cultures. Compared with normal RPE  AMD RPE exhibit increased susceptibility to oxidative stress  produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stress conditions  and showed reduced mitochondrial activity. Measurement of the ratio of LC3-II/ LC3-I  revealed impaired autophagy in AMD RPE as compared with normal RPE. Autophagic flux was also reduced in AMD RPE as compared with normal RPE  as shown by inability of AMD RPE to downregulate p62 levels during starvation. Impaired autophagic pathways were further shown by analyzing late autophagic vesicles; immunostaining with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) antibody revealed enlarged and annular LAMP-1-positive organelles in AMD RPE as opposed to smaller discrete puncta observed in normal RPE. Our study provides insights into AMD cellular and molecular mechanisms  proposes dysfunctional autophagy as an underlying mechanism contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease  and opens up new avenues for development of novel treatment strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Computational Modeling of In Vitro Swelling of Mitochondria: A Biophysical Approach.Swelling of mitochondria plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human diseases by stimulating mitochondria-mediated cell death through apoptosis  necrosis  and autophagy. Changes in the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) of ions and other substances induce an increase in the colloid osmotic pressure  leading to matrix swelling. Modeling of mitochondrial swelling is important for simulation and prediction of in vivo events in the cell during oxidative and energy stress. In the present study  we developed a computational model that describes the mechanism of mitochondrial swelling based on osmosis  the rigidity of the IMM  and dynamics of ionic/neutral species. The model describes a new biophysical approach to swelling dynamics  where osmotic pressure created in the matrix is compensated for by the rigidity of the IMM  i.e.  osmotic pressure induces membrane deformation  which compensates for the osmotic pressure effect. Thus  the effect is linear and reversible at small membrane deformations  allowing the membrane to restore its normal form. On the other hand  the membrane rigidity drops to zero at large deformations  and the swelling becomes irreversible. As a result  an increased number of dysfunctional mitochondria can activate mitophagy and initiate cell death. Numerical modeling analysis produced results that reasonably describe the experimental data reported earlier.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy-Induced Apoptosis in Lung Cancer Cells by a Novel Digitoxin Analog.We have synthesized a novel derivative of Digitoxin  termed "MonoD"  which demonstrates cytotoxic effects in lung cancer cells with much higher potency as compared to Digitoxin. Our data show that within 1 h of MonoD treatment  H460 cells showed increased oxidative stress  increased formation of autophagic vacuoles  and increased expression of pro-autophagic markers Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Cells pretreated with MnTBAP  a superoxide scavenger not only lowered superoxide production  but also had lower levels of LC3-II and Beclin-1. Prolonged treatment with MonoD-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. We investigated MonoD-dependent regulation of Akt and Bcl2  proteins that are known regulators of both autophagy and apoptosis. Molecular and pharmacologic inhibitors of Bcl2 and Akt  when combined with MonoD  led to higher expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1 as compared to MonoD alone  suggesting a repressive effect for these proteins in MonoD-dependent autophagy. Pretreatment of cells with an autophagy inhibitor repressed the apoptotic potential of MonoD  confirming that early autophagic flux is important to drive apoptosis. Therapeutic entities such as MonoD that target multiple pathways such as autophagy and apoptosis may prove advantageous over current therapies that have unimodal basis for action and may drive sustained tumor regression  which is highly desirable.

Electro-Magnetic Nano-Particle Bound Beclin1 siRNA Crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier to Attenuate the Inflammatory Effects of HIV-1 Infection in Vitro.The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel drug delivery system comprised of ferric-cobalt electro-magnetic nano-material (CoFe2O4@ BaTiO3; MENP) bound to siRNA targeting Beclin1 (MENP-siBeclin1) to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and attenuate the neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system following on-demand release of siRNA using an in vitro primary human BBB model. Beclin1 is a key protein in the regulation of the autophagy pathway and we have recently demonstrated the importance of Beclin1 in regulating viral replication and viral-induced inflammation in HIV-1-infected microglia. The MENP-siBeclin1 nano-formulation did not compromise the physiological function or integrity of the BBB model. Furthermore  the in vitro BBB data revealed that MENP-siBeclin1 could efficiently attenuate viral replication and viral-induced inflammation  likely due to STAT1/ NF-κB signaling pathways. MENP-siBeclin1 also silenced Beclin1 protein expression in HIV-1-infected microglial cells within the model system. In addition  the cytotoxic effects of direct treatment with siBeclin1 and MENP alone or in nano-formulation on primary human neuronal cells showed a minimal amount of cell death. Overall  the data shows that the nano-formulation can silence the BECN1 gene as an effective mechanism to attenuate HIV-1 replication and viral-induced inflammation in the context of the BBB.,Autophagy_notLIR
The <i>Salmonella</i> effectors SseF and SseG inhibit Rab1A-mediated autophagy to facilitate intracellular bacterial survival and replication.In mammalian cells  autophagy plays crucial roles in restricting further spread of invading bacterial pathogens. Previous studies have established that the <i>Salmonella</i> virulence factors SseF and SseG are required for intracellular bacterial survival and replication. However  the underlying mechanism by which these two effectors facilitate bacterial infection remains elusive. Here  we report that SseF and SseG secreted by <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S.</i> Typhimurium) inhibit autophagy in host cells and thereby establish a replicative niche for the bacteria in the cytosol. Mechanistically  SseF and SseG impaired autophagy initiation by directly interacting with the small GTPase Rab1A in the host cell. This interaction abolished Rab1A activation by disrupting the interaction with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)  the TRAPPIII (transport protein particle III) complex. This disruption of Rab1A signaling blocked the recruitment and activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate biogenesis  which ultimately impeded autophagosome formation. Furthermore  SseF- or SseG-deficient bacterial strains exhibited reduced survival and growth in both mammalian cell lines and mouse infection models  and Rab1A depletion could rescue these defects. These results reveal that virulence factor-dependent inactivation of the small GTPase Rab1A represents a previously unrecognized strategy of <i>S</i> Typhimurium to evade autophagy and the host defense system.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quantifying autophagy using novel LC3B and p62 TR-FRET assays.Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that can generate energy for cells or clear misfolded or aggregated proteins  and upregulating this process has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe a novel set of LC3B-II and p62 time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays that can detect changes in autophagy in the absence of exogenous labels. Lipidated LC3 is a marker of autophagosomes  while p62 is a substrate of autophagy. These assays can be employed in high-throughput screens to identify novel autophagy upregulators  and can measure autophagy changes in cultured cells or tissues after genetic or pharmacological interventions. We also demonstrate that different cells exhibit varying autophagic responses to pharmacological interventions. Overall  it is clear that a battery of readouts is required to make conclusions about changes in autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Live-stream characterization of cadmium-induced cell death using visible CdTe-QDs.Characterization of cell death currently requires the use of indirect markers  which has largely limited the ability to monitor cell death processes inside the cell. Here  we introduce a new method for the characterization of cell death mechanisms using cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe-QDs). Using visible CdTe-QDs with mesenchymal cells (e.g. synoviocytes)  live-stream imaging allowed for visualization of cadmium-induced cell death  combining characteristics of apoptosis and autophagy. Initially  similar anti-proliferative effect was observed between 10 µg/ml Cd<sup>2+</sup> and CdTe-QDs at 24 h (cell index/cell density ratio decreased from 0.6 to -16.6  p < 0.05) using techniques that do not require the capacity of CdTe-QDs. Apoptosis was confirmed by the quantification of morphological parameters (reduced surface area  increased cell thickness) and positive labeling with annexin V. Autophagy was confirmed by monodansylcadaverine staining  identifying similar autophagic vacuoles with both Cd<sup>2+</sup> and CdTe-QD. However  QD imaging allowed for visualization of cadmium elements inside cell structures and their kinetic changes leading to cell death. Cell death characteristics were similar in inflammatory and non-inflammatory environment but were induced up to 4 h earlier in the former. Therefore  live-stream imaging of a visible cytotoxic agent has useful applications not currently possible with indirect methods  including chronological monitoring of cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy promotes DNA-protein crosslink clearance.Toxic DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) can result from exposure to radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. DPCs can also accumulate during aging or stress. However  the cellular mechanisms underlying clearance of DPCs remain largely unknown. Here  we have identified an important role of autophagy in the processing of DPCs induced by three representative agents: formaldehyde  a chemical used widely in industry; UV light; and camptothecin  a cytotoxic anticancer drug. Autophagy inhibitors  3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine (CQ)  promoted the accumulation of DPCs in damaged cells and injured organs. siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg5 or Atg7  two essential components for the formation of the autophagosome  gave similar results. In contrast  the autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) attenuated DPCs in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal the importance of autophagy in controlling the level of DPCs  and may open up a new avenue for understanding the formation and clearance of this detrimental DNA adduct.,Autophagy_notLIR

The unfolded protein response as a target for anticancer therapeutics.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle in eukaryotic cells  responsible for protein synthesis  folding  sorting  and transportation. ER stress is initiated when the unfolded or misfolded protein load exceeds the capacity of the ER to properly fold protein. Tumor microenvironmental conditions  such as nutrient deprivation  hypoxia  and oxidative stress perturb protein folding and trigger chronic ER stress. Cancer cells can tolerate mild ER stress  however  persistent and severe ER stress kills cancer cells by inducing their autophagy  apoptosis  necroptosis  or immunogenic cell death. Based on this rationale  many drugs have been developed for triggering irremediable ER stress in cancer cells by targeting various processes in the secretory pathway. This review discusses the mechanisms of protein targeting to the ER  the key signaling cassettes that are involved in the ER stress response  and their correlation with cancer formation and progression. Importantly  this review discusses current experimental and FDA approved anti-cancer drugs that induce ER stress  and emerging targets within the secretory pathway for the development of new anticancer drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Silencing of cadherin-17 enhances apoptosis and inhibits autophagy in colorectal cancer cells.Cadherin-17 (CDH17)  a structurally unique member of the non-classical cadherin family  is associated with poor survival  cell proliferation  and metastasis in colorectal cancer. However  the role of CDH17 in the apoptosis and autophagy of colorectal cancer cells remains unclear. Here  we aimed to investigate the effect of CDH17 knockdown on autophagy and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. We inhibited CDH17 expression in KM12SM and KM12C colorectal cancer cells by RNA interference and found that silencing of CDH17 significantly inhibited cell viability and increased apoptosis in KM12SM and KM12C cells. In addition  silencing of CDH17 significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. Concurrently  silencing of CDH17 significantly inhibited the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and decreased the formation of LC3<sup>+</sup> autophagic vacuoles and the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles  indicating that autophagy was significantly inhibited in KM12SM and KM12C cells. Additionally  treatment with the autophagy-specific activator rapamycin attenuated apoptosis in CDH17-knockdown cells and as indicated by decreased caspase-3 activity  decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax  and increased expression of Bcl-2. In conclusion  CDH17 silencing induced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in KM12SM and KM12C cells  and this autophagy protected the cells from apoptotic cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Functional variants in the <i>LRRK2</i> gene confer shared effects on risk for Crohn's disease and Parkinson's disease.Crohn's disease (CD)  a form of inflammatory bowel disease  has a higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish than in non-Jewish European populations. To define the role of nonsynonymous mutations  we performed exome sequencing of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with CD  followed by array-based genotyping and association analysis in 2066 CD cases and 3633 healthy controls. We detected association signals in the <i>LRRK2</i> gene that conferred risk for CD (N2081D variant  <i>P</i> = 9.5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) or protection from CD (N551K variant  tagging R1398H-associated haplotype  <i>P</i> = 3.3 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). These variants affected CD age of onset  disease location  LRRK2 activity  and autophagy. Bayesian network analysis of CD patient intestinal tissue further implicated <i>LRRK2</i> in CD pathogenesis. Analysis of the extended <i>LRRK2</i> locus in 24 570 CD cases  patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)  and healthy controls revealed extensive pleiotropy  with shared genetic effects between CD and PD in both Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish cohorts. The <i>LRRK2</i> N2081D CD risk allele is located in the same kinase domain as G2019S  a mutation that is the major genetic cause of familial and sporadic PD. Like the G2019S mutation  the N2081D variant was associated with increased kinase activity  whereas neither N551K nor R1398H variants on the protective haplotype altered kinase activity. We also confirmed that R1398H  but not N551K  increased guanosine triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing enzyme (GTPase) activity  thereby deactivating LRRK2. The presence of shared <i>LRRK2</i> alleles in CD and PD provides refined insight into disease mechanisms and may have major implications for the treatment of these two seemingly unrelated diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ethanol-triggered Lipophagy Requires SQSTM1 in AML12 Hepatic Cells.Ethanol-induced hepatic lipophagy plays an important cytoprotective role against liver injury  but its mechanism is not fully determined. In the present study  ethanol-induced lipophagy was studied in an immortalized mouse hepatocyte line  AML12. We found that ethanol treatment elevated lipid content in these cells  which could be regulated by autophagy. To determine the potential mechanism  we investigated the role of a key adaptor molecule SQSTM1/p62. SQSTM1 can bind to LC3 on autophagosomes and ubiquitinated molecules on cargos  thus facilitating the autophagic engulfment of the cargo. We found that both LC3 and SQSTM1 could colocalize with lipid droplets (LDs) following ethanol treatment. Colocalization of LC3 with LDs was significantly inhibited by SQSTM1 knockdown  which also reduced ethanol-induced lipid elevation. In addition  increased ubiquitin signals were found to colocalize with SQSTM1 on LDs in response to ethanol. Moreover  the SQSTM1 signal was colocalized with that of perilipin1  a major protein on LDs. Finally  perilipin1 knockdown significantly altered ethanol-induced lipophagy. Taken together  these data support a model in which autophagosomes were directed to the LDs via SQSTM1  which bound to ubiquitinated proteins  possibly including perilipin 1  on LDs. This study provides a potential mechanistic explanation to how ethanol induces lipophagy in hepatocytes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cytosolic and Secreted Peptidoglycan-Degrading Enzymes in Drosophila Respectively Control Local and Systemic Immune Responses to Microbiota.Gut-associated bacteria produce metabolites that both have a local influence on the intestinal tract and act at a distance on remote organs. In Drosophila  bacteria-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) displays such a dual role. PGN triggers local antimicrobial peptide production by enterocytes; it also activates systemic immune responses in fat-body cells and modulates fly behavior by acting on neurons. How these responses to a single microbiota-derived compound are simultaneously coordinated is not understood. We show here that the PGRP-LB locus generates both cytosolic and secreted PGN-cleaving enzymes. Through genetic analysis  we demonstrate that the cytosolic PGRP-LB isoforms cell-autonomously control the intensity of NF-κB activation in enterocytes  whereas the secreted isoform prevents massive and detrimental gut-derived PGN dissemination throughout the organism. This study explains how Drosophila are able to uncouple the modulation of local versus systemic responses to a single gut-bacteria-derived product by using isoform-specific enzymes.,Autophagy_notLIR
CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein β Mediates the Killing of Toxoplasma gondii by Inducing Autophagy in Nonhematopoietic Cells.Autophagy is a main defense strategy by which infected host cells can virtually induce the killing of parasite  including Toxoplasma gondii. However  the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in T. gondii-infected nonhematopoietic cells are still unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBP β) is associated with the regulation of autophagy. Herein  we hypothesized that C/EBP β plays roles in inducing autophagy in nonhematopoietic cells. Expression of C/EBP β was aberrantly regulated in endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells challenged by T. gondii. Inhibition of C/EBP β reduced the killing of T. gondii in nonhematopoietic cells  whereas C/EBP β overexpression resulted in the enhancement of killing of T. gondii as well as the increase in autophagy in infected cells. Furthermore  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation was found to be reduced by C/EBP β overexpression  but increased by C/EBP β inhibition. The increase in T. gondii killing induced by C/EBP β overexpression was blocked by the mTOR activator phosphatidic acid and was increased by the inhibitor AZD8055. In conclusion  we demonstrate that C/EBP β expression is increased in nonhematopoietic cells infected by T. gondii  resulting in the activation of autophagy in host cells by inhibiting mTOR pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
<sup>188</sup>Re-Liposome Can Induce Mitochondrial Autophagy and Reverse Drug Resistance for Ovarian Cancer: From Bench Evidence to Preliminary Clinical Proof-of-Concept.Despite standard treatment  about 70% of ovarian cancer will recur. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in the drug-resistance mechanism. Several drug resistance mechanisms have been proposed  and among these  autophagy plays a crucial role for the maintenance and tumorigenicity of CSCs. Compared to their differentiated counterparts  CSCs have been demonstrated to display a significantly higher level of autophagy flux. Moreover  mitophagy  a specific type of autophagy that selectively degrades excessive or damaged mitochondria  is shown to contribute to cancer progression and recurrence in several types of tumors. Nanomedicine has been shown to tackle the CSCs problem by overcoming drug resistance. In this work  we developed a nanomedicine  <sup>188</sup>Re-liposome  which was demonstrated to target autophagy and mitophagy in the tumor microenvironment. Of note  the inhibition of autophagy and mitophagy could lead to significant tumor inhibition in two xenograft animal models. Lastly  we presented two cases of recurrent ovarian cancer  both in drug resistance status that received a level I dose from a phase I clinical trial. Both cases developing drug resistance showed drug sensitivity to <sup>188</sup>Re-liposome. These results suggest that inhibition of autophagy and mitophagy by a nanomedicine may be a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR

The Recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccine VPM1002: Ready for Clinical Efficacy Testing.The only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB)  bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)  protects against severe extrapulmonary forms of TB but is virtually ineffective against the most prevalent form of the disease  pulmonary TB. BCG was genetically modified at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology to improve its immunogenicity by replacing the urease C encoding gene with the listeriolysin encoding gene from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. Listeriolysin perturbates the phagosomal membrane at acidic pH. Urease C is involved in neutralization of the phagosome harboring BCG. Its depletion allows for rapid phagosome acidification and promotes phagolysosome fusion. As a result  BCGΔ<i>ureC</i>::<i>hly</i> (VPM1002) promotes apoptosis and autophagy and facilitates release of mycobacterial antigens into the cytosol. In preclinical studies  VPM1002 has been far more efficacious and safer than BCG. The vaccine was licensed to Vakzine Projekt Management and later sublicensed to the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd.  the largest vaccine producer in the world. The vaccine has passed phase I clinical trials in Germany and South Africa  demonstrating its safety and immunogenicity in young adults. It was also successfully tested in a phase IIa randomized clinical trial in healthy South African newborns and is currently undergoing a phase IIb study in HIV exposed and unexposed newborns. A phase II/III clinical trial will commence in India in 2017 to assess efficacy against recurrence of TB. The target indications for VPM1002 are newborn immunization to prevent TB as well as post-exposure immunization in adults to prevent TB recurrence. In addition  a Phase I trial in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients has been completed  and phase II trials are ongoing. This review describes the development of VPM1002 from the drawing board to its clinical assessment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Acute Kidney Injury.Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global public health concern associated with high morbidity  mortality  and healthcare costs. Other than dialysis  no therapeutic interventions reliably improve survival  limit injury  or speed recovery. Despite recognized shortcomings of in vivo animal models  the underlying pathophysiology of AKI and its consequence  chronic kidney disease (CKD)  is rich with biological targets. We review recent findings relating to the renal vasculature and cellular stress responses  primarily the intersection of the unfolded protein response  mitochondrial dysfunction  autophagy  and the innate immune response. Maladaptive repair mechanisms that persist following the acute phase promote inflammation and fibrosis in the chronic phase. Here macrophages  growth-arrested tubular epithelial cells  the endothelium  and surrounding pericytes are key players in the progression to chronic disease. Better understanding of these complex interacting pathophysiological mechanisms  their relative importance in humans  and the utility of biomarkers will lead to therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat AKI or impede progression to CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).,Autophagy_notLIR
Taxifolin synergizes Andrographolide-induced cell death by attenuation of autophagy and augmentation of caspase dependent and independent cell death in HeLa cells.Andrographolide (Andro) has emerged recently as a potential and effective anticancer agent with induction of apoptosis in some cancer cell lines while induction of G2/M arrest with weak apoptosis in others. Few studies have proved that Andro is also effective in combination therapy. The flavonoid Taxifolin (Taxi) has showed anti-oxidant and antiproliferative effects against different cancer cells. Therefore  the present study investigated the cytotoxic effects of Andro alone or in combination with Taxi on HeLa cells. The combination of Andro with Taxi was synergistic at all tested concentrations and combination ratios. Andro alone induced caspase-dependent apoptosis which was enhanced by the combination with Taxi and attenuated partly by using Z-Vad-Fmk. Andro induced a protective reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent autophagy which was attenuated by Taxi. The activation of p53 was involved in Andro-induced autophagy where the use of Taxi or pifithrin-α (PFT-α) decreased it while the activation of JNK was involved in the cell death of HeLa cells but not in the induction of autophagy. The mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) plays an important role in Andro-induced cell death in HeLa cells. Andro alone increased the MOMP which was further increased in the case of combination. This led to the increase in AIF and cytochrome c release from mitochondria which consequently increased caspase-dependent and independent cell death. In conclusion  Andro induced a protective autophagy in HeLa cells which was reduced by Taxi and the cell death was increased by increasing the MOMP and subsequently the caspase-dependent and independent cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation and function of AMPK in physiology and diseases.5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that was originally identified as the key player in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Intensive research over the last decade has identified diverse molecular mechanisms and physiological conditions that regulate the AMPK activity. AMPK regulates diverse metabolic and physiological processes and is dysregulated in major chronic diseases  such as obesity  inflammation  diabetes and cancer. On the basis of its critical roles in physiology and pathology  AMPK is emerging as one of the most promising targets for both the prevention and treatment of these diseases. In this review  we discuss the current understanding of the molecular and physiological regulation of AMPK and its metabolic and physiological functions. In addition  we discuss the mechanisms underlying the versatile roles of AMPK in diabetes and cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
An overview of polyamine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest major cancers  with a five year survival rate of less than 8%. With current therapies only giving rise to modest life extension  new approaches are desperately needed. Even though targeting polyamine metabolism is a proven anticancer strategy  there are no reports  which thoroughly survey the literature describing the role of polyamine biosynthesis and transport in PDAC. This review seeks to fill this void by describing what is currently known about polyamine metabolism in PDAC and identifies new targets and opportunities to treat this disease. Due to the pleiotropic effects that polyamines play in cells  this review covers diverse areas ranging from polyamine metabolism (biosynthesis  catabolism and transport)  as well as the potential role of polyamines in desmoplasia  autophagy and immune privilege. Understanding these diverse roles provides the opportunity to design new therapies to treat this deadly cancer via polyamine depletion.,Autophagy_notLIR
Subcellular localizations of Arabidopsis myotubularins MTM1 and MTM2 suggest possible functions in vesicular trafficking between ER and cis-Golgi.The two Arabidopsis genes AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 encode highly similar phosphoinositide 3-phosphatases from the myotubularin family. Despite the high-level conservation of structure and biochemical activities  their physiological roles have significantly diverged. The nature of a membrane and the concentrations of their membrane-anchored substrates (PtdIns3P or PtdIns3 5P2) and/or products (PtdIns5P and PtdIns) are considered critical for determining the functional specificity of myotubularins. We have performed comprehensive analyses of the subcellular localization of AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 using a variety of specific constructs transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells under the control of 35S promoter. AtMTM1 co-localized preferentially with cis-Golgi membranes  while AtMTM2 associated predominantly with ER membranes. In a stark contrast with animal/human MTMs  neither AtMTM1 nor AtMTM2 co-localizes with early or late endosomes or with TGN/EE compartments  making them unlikely participants in the endosomal trafficking system. Localization of the AtMTM2 is sensitive to cold and osmotic stress challenges. In contrast to animal myotubularins  Arabidopsis myotubularins do not associate with endosomes. Our results suggest that Arabidopsis myotubularins play a role in the vesicular trafficking between ER exit sites and cis-Golgi elements. The significance of these results is discussed also in the context of stress biology and plant autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Melatonin increases human cervical cancer HeLa cells apoptosis induced by cisplatin via inhibition of JNK/Parkin/mitophagy axis.Considering that chemotherapy resistance is vital to the progression of cervical carcinoma  emerging researchers are focused on developing anti-tumor drugs to assist the treatment efficiency of chemotherapy. Melatonin has anti-tumor activity via several mechanisms including its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects as well as its potent pro-oxidant action in tumor cells. Therefore  melatonin may be useful for the treatment of tumors in association with chemotherapy drugs. Here  we studied the effect and mechanism of melatonin on HeLa cells apoptosis under cisplatin (CIS) treatment  particularly focusing on the caspase-9-related apoptosis pathway and mitophagy-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanism. The result indicated that co-stimulation of HeLa cells with CIS in the presence of melatonin further increased cellular apoptosis. Furthermore  concomitant treatments with melatonin and CIS significantly enhanced the mitochondrial structure and function damage  substantially augmented the caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis with evidenced by lower mitochondria membrane potential  higher mitochondria ROS  and more pro-apoptotic proteins compared to the treatment with CIS alone. Mechanistically  melatonin inactivated mitophagy via blockade of JNK/Parkin  leading to the inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitophagy. The mitophagy had the ability to clear and remove damaged mitochondria  impairing CIS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Activation of JNK/Parkin could alleviate the lethal effect of melatonin on HeLa cells. In summary  this study confirmed that melatonin sensitizes human cervical cancer HeLa cells to CIS-induced apoptosis through inhibition of JNK/Parkin/mitophagy pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
The BH3 Mimetic Obatoclax Accumulates in Lysosomes and Causes Their Alkalinization.Obatoclax belongs to a class of compounds known as BH3 mimetics which function as antagonists of Bcl-2 family apoptosis regulators. It has undergone extensive preclinical and clinical evaluation as a cancer therapeutic. Despite this  it is clear that obatoclax has additional pharmacological effects that contribute to its cytotoxic activity. It has been claimed that obatoclax  either alone or in combination with other molecularly targeted therapeutics  induces an autophagic form of cell death. In addition  obatoclax has been shown to inhibit lysosomal function  but the mechanism of this has not been elucidated. We have evaluated the mechanism of action of obatoclax in eight ovarian cancer cell lines. Consistent with its function as a BH3 mimetic  obatoclax induced apoptosis in three cell lines. However  in the remaining cell lines another form of cell death was evident because caspase activation and PARP cleavage were not observed. Obatoclax also failed to show synergy with carboplatin and paclitaxel  chemotherapeutic agents which we have previously shown to be synergistic with authentic Bcl-2 family antagonists. Obatoclax induced a profound accumulation of LC-3 but knockdown of Atg-5 or beclin had only minor effects on the activity of obatoclax in cell growth assays suggesting that the inhibition of lysosomal function rather than stimulation of autophagy may play a more prominent role in these cells. To evaluate how obatoclax inhibits lysosomal function  confocal microscopy studies were conducted which demonstrated that obatoclax  which contains two basic pyrrole groups  accumulates in lysosomes. Studies using pH sensitive dyes demonstrated that obatoclax induced lysosomal alkalinization. Furthermore  obatoclax was synergistic in cell growth/survival assays with bafilomycin and chloroquine  two other drugs which cause lysosomal alkalinization. These studies explain  for the first time  how obatoclax inhibits lysosomal function and suggest that lysosomal alkalinization contributes to the cytotoxic activity of obatoclax.,Autophagy_notLIR
Glycophagy: An emerging target in pathology.Autophagy  a highly conserved self-digestion process  is initially regarded as non-selectively sequestering and degradation cytoplasmic contents. Nowadays  many kinds of selective autophagy have been found in response to various physiological cues such as mitophagy  reticulophagy and glycophagy. Glycophagy  as a selective autophagy  plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in many tissues including heart  liver and skeletal muscles. Moreover  glycophagy is highly regulated by many signal pathways like the cyclic AMP protein kinase A/protein kinase A  PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR and Calcium. Latest studies have demonstrated that glycophagy is triggered by STBD1  which tethers glycogen to membranes via binding itself to the cognate autophagy protein GABARAPL1. More importantly  glycophagy might act as a protective role in coping with the accumulation of glycogen-rich lysosomes in infant patients with Pompe disease. However  glycophagy might aggravate diabetic cardiomyopathy via FoxO1 signal pathway. In this review  we focus on some findings about the occurrence and development  as well as the regulatory mechanism of glycophagy. We also analyze the role of glycophagy in Pompe disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Targeting glycophagy may open a new avenue of therapeutic intervention to these diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR

New developments in mechanisms of prostate cancer progression.Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in men. The etiology of prostate cancer development and the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent progression remains to be further investigated. There are many known targets for prostate cancer therapy including the androgen receptor (AR) axis  but resistance eventually develops in advanced disease suggesting the need to better understand mechanisms of resistance and consideration of multi-targeted therapy. Mechanisms contributing to resistance may include gene amplifications  gene mutations  AR splice variants  and changes in expression of androgen receptor co-regulatory proteins. Given the limitations of approved therapies  further study of additional potential targets is warranted. This review focuses on the roles of autophagy pathway  p62  Yes-associated protein (YAP)  cancer stem cells  and epigenetics. Therapies targeting these potential mechanisms of resistance may interact with currently approved therapies either additively or synergistically. Thus  the study of combination therapy against multiple targets may be critically important to achieve more impact against lethal forms of prostate cancer resistant to all approved current therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Microfold Cells Actively Translocate Mycobacterium tuberculosis to Initiate Infection.The prevailing paradigm is that tuberculosis infection is initiated when patrolling alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells within the terminal alveolus ingest inhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However  definitive data for this model are lacking. Among the epithelial cells of the upper airway  a specialized epithelial cell known as a microfold cell (M cell) overlies various components of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue. Here  using multiple mouse models  we show that Mtb invades via M cells to initiate infection. Intranasal Mtb infection in mice lacking M cells either genetically or by antibody depletion resulted in reduced invasion and dissemination to draining lymph nodes. M cell-depleted mice infected via aerosol also had delayed dissemination to lymph nodes and reduced mortality. Translocation of Mtb across two M cell transwell models was rapid and transcellular. Thus  M cell translocation is a vital entry mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of Mtb.,Autophagy_notLIR
Upregulation of the lncRNA Meg3 induces autophagy to inhibit tumorigenesis and progression of epithelial ovarian carcinoma by regulating activity of ATG3.Maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3)  a long non-coding RNA  has been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of multiple malignancies. However  little is known regarding the role of Meg3 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study  we found that the expression of Meg3 was lower in epithelial ovarian carcinoma  and has potential to be considered as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. After transfecting the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3 and A2780 with Meg3  phenotypic changes and autophagy-related molecules were examined. Upregulation of Meg3 inhibited cell proliferation  plate colony formation  induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phases  and promoted apoptosis. Observation of autophagosomes was performed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of LC3-II  ATG3  LAMP1 were elevated  while SQSTM1/p62 expression declined. Upregulated expression of Meg3 also suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model through upregulating ATG3 expression. RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) and RNA pull-down assays showed that Meg3 was co-immunoprecipitated with ATG3. In addition  Meg3 protected ATG3 mRNA from degradation following treatment with actinomycin D. Overall  our results suggest that the lncRNA Meg3 acts as a tumor suppressor in EOC by regulating ATG3 activity and inducing autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of ER stress and unfolding protein response pathways causes skeletal muscle wasting during cancer cachexia.Cachexia is a devastating syndrome that causes morbidity and mortality in a large number of patients with cancer. However  the mechanisms of cancer cachexia remain poorly understood. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress. The ER responds to this stress through activating certain pathways commonly known as the unfolding protein response (UPR). The main function of UPR is to restore homeostasis  but excessive or prolonged activation of UPR can lead to pathologic conditions. In this study  we examined the role of ER stress and UPR in regulation of skeletal muscle mass in naïve conditions and during cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that multiple markers of ER stress are highly activated in skeletal muscle of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and Apc(Min/+) mouse models of cancer cachexia. Treatment of mice with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA)  a chemical chaperon and a potent inhibitor of ER stress  significantly reduced skeletal muscle strength and mass in both control and LLC-bearing mice. Blocking the UPR also increased the proportion of fast-type fibers in soleus muscle of both control and LLC-bearing mice. Inhibition of UPR reduced the activity of Akt/mTOR pathway and increased the expression of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in LLC-bearing mice. Moreover  we found that the inhibition of UPR causes severe atrophy in cultured myotubes. Our study provides initial evidence that ER stress and UPR pathways are essential for maintaining skeletal muscle mass and strength and for protection against cancer cachexia.-Bohnert  K. R.

Effect of GTP-binding protein (YPT1 protein) on the enhanced yeast vacuolar activity.Yeast GTP-binding protein (YPT1 protein) has been reported to function in the early stages of the secretory pathway. Particularly  YPT1 protein is observed to regulate both the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport and the autophagy. Therefore  the YPT1 protein overexpressed in yeast vacuoles is expected to enhance antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The enhancement of yeast vacuolar activity under the overexpression of YPT1 was evaluated by the analysis of lysozyme activity  antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus  and MTT assay against HeLa cell lines. Additionally  the rise in concentration of some important proteinases inside the vacuole  such as proteinase A  proteinase B  and vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) were also recorded using a 2DE technique. All results imply YPT1 involvement in the recruitment of some specific proteinases into vacuoles  which leads to the enhancement of vacuolar activity. Since these there proteinases belong to the CPY pathway  YPT1 is even believed to up-regulate this trafficking pathway in yeast cells. Future studies  however  should be carried out to discover the mechanisms that allow YPT1 to recruit these proteins into yeast vacuoles.,Autophagy_notLIR
Arginine Supplementation Recovered the IFN-γ-Mediated Decrease in Milk Protein and Fat Synthesis by Inhibiting the GCN2/eIF2α Pathway  Which Induces Autophagy in Primary Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.During the lactation cycle of the bovine mammary gland  autophagy is induced in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) as a cellular homeostasis and survival mechanism. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is an important antiproliferative and apoptogenic factor that has been shown to induce autophagy in multiple cell lines in vitro. However  it remains unclear whether IFN-γ can induce autophagy and whether autophagy affects milk synthesis in BMECs. To understand whether IFN-γ affects milk synthesis  we isolated and purified primary BMECs and investigated the effect of IFN-γ on milk synthesis in primary BMECs in vitro. The results showed that IFN-γ significantly inhibits milk synthesis and that autophagy was clearly induced in primary BMECs in vitro within 24 h. Interestingly  autophagy was observed following IFN-γ treatment  and the inhibition of autophagy can improve milk protein and milk fat synthesis. Conversely  upregulation of autophagy decreased milk synthesis. Furthermore  mechanistic analysis confirmed that IFN-γ mediated autophagy by depleting arginine and inhibiting the general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2)/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) signaling pathway in BMECs. Then  it was found that arginine supplementation could attenuate IFN-γ-induced autophagy and recover milk synthesis to some extent. These findings may not only provide a novel measure for preventing the IFN-γ-induced decrease in milk quality but also a useful therapeutic approach for IFN-γ-associated breast diseases in other animals and humans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hypoxic mitophagy regulates mitochondrial quality and platelet activation and determines severity of I/R heart injury.Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies many prevalent diseases including heart disease arising from acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here  we demonstrate that mitophagy  which selectively removes damaged or unwanted mitochondria  regulated mitochondrial quality and quantity <i>in vivo</i>. Hypoxia induced extensive mitochondrial degradation in a FUNDC1-dependent manner in platelets  and this was blocked by <i>in vivo</i> administration of a cell-penetrating peptide encompassing the LIR motif of FUNDC1 only in wild-type mice. Genetic ablation of Fundc1 impaired mitochondrial quality and increased mitochondrial mass in platelets and rendered the platelets insensitive to hypoxia and the peptide. Moreover  hypoxic mitophagy in platelets protected the heart from worsening of I/R injury. This represents a new mechanism of the hypoxic preconditioning effect which reduces I/R injury. Our results demonstrate a critical role of mitophagy in mitochondrial quality control and platelet activation  and suggest that manipulation of mitophagy by hypoxia or pharmacological approaches may be a novel strategy for cardioprotection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Changes in the Hippocampal Proteome Associated with Spatial Memory Impairment after Exposure to Low (20 cGy) Doses of 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe Radiation.Exposure to low (∼20 cGy) doses of high-energy charged (HZE) particles  such as 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe  results in impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (e.g.  novel object recognition and spatial memory) in rodents. While these findings raise the possibility that astronauts on deep-space missions may develop cognitive deficits  not all rats develop HZE-induced cognitive impairments  even after exposure to high (200 cGy) HZE doses. The reasons for this differential sensitivity in some animals that develop HZE-induced cognitive failure remain speculative. We employed a robust quantitative mass spectrometry-based workflow  which links early-stage discovery to next-stage quantitative verification  to identify differentially active proteins/pathways in rats that developed spatial memory impairment at three months after exposure to 20 cGy of 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe (20/impaired)  and in those rats that managed to maintain normal cognitive performance (20/functional). Quantitative data were obtained on 665-828 hippocampal proteins in the various cohorts of rats studied  of which 580 were expressed in all groups. A total of 107 proteins were upregulated in the irradiated rats irrespective of their spatial memory performance status  which included proteins involved in oxidative damage response  calcium transport and signaling. Thirty percent (37/107) of these "radiation biomarkers" formed a functional interactome of the proteasome and the COP9 signalosome. These data suggest that there is persistent oxidative stress  ongoing autophagy and altered synaptic plasticity in the irradiated hippocampus  irrespective of the spatial memory performance status  suggesting that the ultimate phenotype may be determined by how well the hippocampal neurons compensate to the ongoing oxidative stress and associated side effects. There were 67 proteins with expression that correlated with impaired spatial memory performance. Several of the "impaired biomarkers" have been implicated in poor spatial memory performance  neurodegeneration  neuronal loss or neuronal susceptibility to apoptosis  or neuronal synaptic or structural plasticity. Therefore  in addition to the baseline oxidative stress and altered adenosine metabolism observed in all irradiated rats  the 20/impaired rats expressed proteins that led to poor spatial memory performance  enhanced neuronal loss and apoptosis  changes in synaptic plasticity and dendritic remodeling. A total of 46 proteins  which were differentially upregulated in the sham-irradiated and 20/functional rat cohorts  can thus be considered as markers of good spatial memory  while another 95 proteins are associated with the maintenance of good spatial memory in the 20/functional rats. The loss or downregulation of these "good spatial memory" proteins would most likely exacerbate the situation in the 20/impaired rats  having a major impact on their neurocognitive status  given that many of those proteins play an important role in neuronal homeostasis and function. Our large-scale comprehensive proteomic analysis has provided some insight into the processes that are altered after exposure  and the collective data suggests that there are multiple problems with the functionality of the neurons and astrocytes in the irradiated hippocampi  which appear to be further exacerbated in the rats that have impaired spatial memory performance or partially compensated for in the rats with good spatial memory.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cocaine-Mediated Autophagy in Astrocytes Involves Sigma 1 Receptor  PI3K  mTOR  Atg5/7  Beclin-1 and Induces Type II Programed Cell Death.Cocaine  a commonly used drug of abuse  has been shown to cause neuropathological dysfunction and damage in the human brain. However  the role of autophagy in this process is not defined. Autophagy  generally protective in nature  can also be destructive leading to autophagic cell death. This study was designed to investigate whether cocaine induces autophagy in the cells of CNS origin. We employed astrocyte  the most abundant cell in the CNS  to define the effects of cocaine on autophagy. We measured levels of the autophagic marker protein LC3II in SVGA astrocytes after exposure with cocaine. The results showed that cocaine caused an increase in LC3II level in a dose- and time-dependent manner  with the peak observed at 1 mM cocaine after 6-h exposure. This result was also confirmed by detecting LC3II in SVGA astrocytes using confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Next  we sought to explore the mechanism by which cocaine induces the autophagic response. We found that cocaine-induced autophagy was mediated by sigma 1 receptor  and autophagy signaling proteins p-mTOR  Atg5  Atg7  and p-Bcl-2/Beclin-1 were also involved  and this was confirmed by using selective inhibitors and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In addition  we found that chronic treatment with cocaine resulted in cell death  which is caspase-3 independent and can be ameliorated by autophagy inhibitor. Therefore  this study demonstrated that cocaine induces autophagy in astrocytes and is associated with autophagic cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR
Macrolide Antibiotics Exhibit Cytotoxic Effect under Amino Acid-Depleted Culture Condition by Blocking Autophagy Flux in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines.Autophagy  a self-digestive system for cytoplasmic components  is required to maintain the amino acid pool for cellular homeostasis. We previously reported that the macrolide antibiotics azithromycin (AZM) and clarithromycin (CAM) have an inhibitory effect on autophagy flux  and they potently enhance the cytocidal effect of various anticancer reagents in vitro. This suggests that macrolide antibiotics can be used as an adjuvant for cancer chemotherapy. Since cancer cells require a larger metabolic demand than normal cells because of their exuberant growth  upregulated autophagy in tumor cells has now become the target for cancer therapy. In the present study  we examined whether macrolides exhibit cytotoxic effect under an amino acid-starving condition in head and neck squamous cancer cell lines such as CAL 27 and Detroit 562 as models of solid tumors with an upregulated autophagy in the central region owing to hypovascularity. AZM and CAM induced cell death under the amino acid-depleted (AAD) culture condition in these cell lines along with CHOP upregulation  although they showed no cytotoxicity under the complete culture medium. CHOP knockdown by siRNA in the CAL 27 cells significantly suppressed macrolide-induced cell death under the AAD culture condition. CHOP-/- murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines also attenuated AZM-induced cell death compared with CHOP+/+ MEF cell lines. Using a tet-off atg5 MEF cell line  knockout of atg5  an essential gene for autophagy  also induced cell death and CHOP in the AAD culture medium but not in the complete culture medium. This suggest that macrolide-induced cell death via CHOP induction is dependent on autophagy inhibition. The cytotoxicity of macrolide with CHOP induction was completely cancelled by the addition of amino acids in the culture medium  indicating that the cytotoxicity is due to the insufficient amino acid pool. These data suggest the possibility of using macrolides for "tumor-starving therapy".,Autophagy_notLIR
The relationship between glucocerebrosidase mutations and Parkinson disease.Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease  whereas Gaucher disease (GD) is the most frequent lysosomal storage disorder caused by homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene. Increased risk of developing PD has been observed in both GD patients and carriers. It has been estimated that GBA1 mutations confer a 20- to 30-fold increased risk for the development of PD  and that at least 7-10% of PD patients have a GBA1 mutation. To date  mutations in the GBA1 gene constitute numerically the most important risk factor for PD. The type of PD associated with GBA1 mutations (PD-GBA1) is almost identical to idiopathic PD  except for a slightly younger age of onset and a tendency to more cognitive impairment. Importantly  the pathology of PD-GBA1 is identical to idiopathic PD  with nigral dopamine cell loss  Lewy bodies  and neurites containing alpha-synuclein. The mechanism by which GBA1 mutations increase the risk for PD is still unknown. However  given that clinical manifestation and pathological findings in PD-GBA1 patients are almost identical to those in idiopathic PD individuals  it is likely that  as in idiopathic PD  alpha-synuclein accumulation  mitochondrial dysfunction  autophagic impairment  oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress may contribute to the development and progression of PD-GBA1. Here  we review the GBA1 gene  its role in GD  and its link with PD. The impact of glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) mutations on functioning of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  lysosomes  and mitochondria. GBA1 mutations resulting in production of misfolded glucocerebrosidase (GCase) significantly affect the ER functioning. Misfolded GCase trapped in the ER leads to both an increase in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the ER stress. The presence of ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and/or endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). The prolonged activation of UPR and ERAD subsequently leads to increased apoptosis. The presence of misfolded GCase in the lysosomes together with a reduction in wild-type GCase levels lead to a retardation of alpha-synuclein degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)  which subsequently results in alpha-synuclein accumulation and aggregation. Impaired lysosomal functioning also causes a decrease in the clearance of autophagosomes  and so their accumulation. GBA1 mutations perturb normal mitochondria functioning by increasing generation of free radical species (ROS) and decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production  oxygen consumption  and membrane potential. GBA1 mutations also lead to accumulation of dysfunctional and fragmented mitochondria. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of Atrazine and Chlorpyrifos on Autophagy-Related Genes in the Brain of Common Carp: Health-Risk Assessments.This study assessed the impacts of atrazine (ATR)  chlorpyrifos (CPF)  and a combined ATR/CPF exposure on the brain of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). The carp were sampled after a 40-days exposure to CPF and ATR  individually or in combination  followed by a 40-days recovery period to measure autophagy and antioxidant activity. The results indicate that the anti-superoxide anion and anti-hydroxy radical activities decreased upon exposure to ATR  CPF  and the ATR/CPF combination but increased after a subsequent 40-days recovery period. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of LC3B and dynein in common carp decreased significantly after exposure to ATR and CPF alone or in combination. Moreover  the mRNA and protein levels of beclin1 gene decreased significantly only in the 116 and 11.3 μg/L treatment groups. However  the mRNA and protein levels of all tested genes increased significantly after a 40-days recovery. Transmission electron microscope demonstrated the occurrence of autolysosomes in the recovery groups but not in the exposure groups. These results suggest that exposure to ATR  CPF  or their combination promotes oxidative stress and autophagic responses in the brain of common carp.,Autophagy_notLIR
Amiodarone promotes cancer cell death through elevated truncated SRSF3 and downregulation of miR-224.Amiodarone is a widely used class III antiarrhythmic agent which prolongs the action potential and refractory period by blockage of several types of myocardial potassium channels. Emerging evidence suggests that amiodarone sensitize tumor cells in response to chemotherapy. Nevertheless  little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. To gain further insight  we demonstrated that amiodarone accumulated the population of a premature termination codon-containing isoform of serine and arginine rich splicing factor 3 (<i>SRSF3-PTC</i>) without increasing alternative spliced <i>p53 beta</i> isoform. Amiodarone enhanced reactive oxygen species production and increased cell apoptosis  whereas reduced DNA damage. Moreover  amiodarone suppressed miR-224 and increased its target <i>COX-2</i> expression. Taken together  our results suggested amiodarone caused cancer cell death might be through increased <i>SRSF3-PTC</i> and miR-224 reduction in a p53-independent manner.,Autophagy_notLIR
Down-regulation of OGT promotes cisplatin resistance by inducing autophagy in ovarian cancer.Cisplatin resistance significantly affects the survival rate of patients with ovarian cancer. However  the main mechanism underlying cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of OGT  OGA and <i>O</i>-GlcNAc in chemoresistant and chemosensitive ovarian cancer tissues. Functional analyses (in vitro and in vivo) were performed to confirm the role of OGT in cisplatin resistance. Autophagy-related proteins were tested by western blot. Transmission electron microscopy and mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus reporter were used for autophagy flux analysis. Immunoprecipitation assay was utilized to detect protein-protein interactions. <b>Results:</b> We found that <i>O</i>-GlcNAc and <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) levels were significantly lower in chemoresistant ovarian cancer tissues than in chemosensitive tissues  whereas <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase (OGA) levels did not differ. The down-regulation of OGT increased cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells but had no effect on the efficacy of paclitaxel. The down-regulation of OGT improved tumor resistance to cisplatin in a mouse xenograft tumor model. OGT knockdown enhanced cisplatin-induced autophagy  which reduced apoptotic cell death induced by cisplatin  and promoted autolysosome formation. A reduction in <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylated SNAP-29 levels caused by the down-regulation of OGT promoted the formation of the SNARE complex and autophagic flux. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that down-regulation of OGT enhances cisplatin-induced autophagy via SNAP-29  resulting in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. OGT may represent a novel target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effect on the liver cancer cell invasion ability by studying the associations between autophagy and TRAP1 expression.Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer associated mortality  particularly in eastern Asia. Autophagy serves an important role in carcinogenesis. Previous studies have reported that TRAP1 is a novel and efficient therapeutic target in various tumors. However  the associations between autophagy and TRAP1 is not clear. In the present study  autophagy activity and TRAP1 expression were examined in 4 different liver cancer cell lines (HepG2  Hep3B2.1-7  Sk-hep1 and HepG2.2.15) with or without rapamycin induction. The cell autophagy level was validated by monodansylcadaverine fluorescent staining  and the expression levels of Beclin1 and light chain (LC)-3-II/LC3-I. The mRNA and protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP-1)  Beclin1 and LC3-II/LC3-I were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction  Protein Simple Western and western blot analysis. HepG2 cells  with medium invasive ability  exerted the highest basal level of autophagy and TRAP1 expression. In addition  hepatitis B (HBV) infection in HepG2 cells inhibited autophagy activity and TRAP1 expression. Rapamycin treatment also significantly enhanced autophagy in the 4 liver cancer cell lines and increased TRAP1 expression in HepG2  Hep3B2.1-7 and Sk-hep1 cells. Thus  the cell invasive ability  HBV infection and autophagy induction had different effects on TRAP1 expression  and TRAP1 may be associated with autophagy in liver cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
The tumor-suppressor cholesterol metabolite  dendrogenin A  is a new class of LXR modulator activating lethal autophagy in cancers.Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a mammalian cholesterol metabolite recently identified that displays tumor suppressor properties. The discovery of DDA has revealed the existence in mammals of a new metabolic branch in the cholesterol pathway centered on 5 6α-epoxycholesterol and bridging cholesterol metabolism with histamine metabolism. Metabolic studies showed a drop in DDA levels in cancer cells and tumors compared to normal cells  suggesting a link between DDA metabolism deregulation and oncogenesis. Importantly  complementation of cancer cells with DDA induced 1) cancer cell re-differentiation  2) blockade of 6-oxo-cholestan-3β 5α-diol (OCDO) production  an endogenous tumor promoter and 3) lethal autophagy in tumors. Importantly  by binding the liver X receptor (LXR)  DDA activates the expression of genes controlling autophagy. These genes include NR4A1  NR4A3  LC3 and TFEB. The canonical LXR ligands 22(R)hydroxycholesterol  TO901317 and GW3965 did not induce these effects indicating that DDA delineates a new class of selective LXR modulator (SLiM). The induction of lethal autophagy by DDA was associated with the accumulation in cancer cells of lysosomes and of the pro-lysosomal cholesterol precursor zymostenol due to the inhibition of the 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ<sup>8</sup>Δ<sup>7</sup>-isomerase enzyme (D8D7I). The anti-cancer efficacy of DDA was established on different mouse and human cancers such as breast cancers  melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia  including patient derived xenografts  and did not discriminate bulk cancer cells from cancer cell progenitors. Together these data highlight that the mammalian metabolite DDA is a promising anticancer compound with a broad range of anticancer applications. In addition  DDA and LXR are new actors in the transcriptional control of autophagy and DDA being a "first in line" driver of lethal autophagy in cancers via the LXR.,Autophagy_notLIR
Loss of malin  but not laforin  results in compromised autophagic flux and proteasomal dysfunction in cells exposed to heat shock.Heat stress to a cell leads to the activation of heat shock response  which is required for the management of misfolded and unfolded proteins. Macroautophagy and proteasome-mediated degradation are the two cellular processes that degrade polyubiquitinated  misfolded proteins. Contrasting pieces of evidence exist on the effect of heat stress on the activation of the above-mentioned degradative pathways. Laforin phosphatase and malin E3 ubiquitin ligase  the two proteins defective in Lafora neurodegenerative disorder  are involved in cellular stress response pathways and are required for the activation of heat shock transcription factor - the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) - and  consequently  for cellular protection under heat shock. While the role of laforin and malin in the proteolytic pathways is well established  their role in cellular recovery from heat shock was not explored. To address this  we investigated autophagic flux  proteasomal activity  and the level of polyubiquitinated proteins in Neuro2a cells partially silenced for laforin or malin protein and exposed to heat shock. We found that heat shock was able to induce autophagic flux  proteasomal activity and reduce the polyubiquitinated proteins load in the laforin-silenced cells but not in the malin-deficient cells. Loss of malin leads to reduced proteasomal activity in the heat-shocked cells. Taken together  our results suggest a distinct mode of action for laforin and malin in the heat shock-induced proteolytic processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Silica nanoparticles induce autophagosome accumulation via activation of the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways in hepatocytes.Autophagy dysfunction is a potential toxic effect of nanoparticles. Previous studies have indicated that silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) induce macroautophagy/autophagy dysfunction  while the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. Hence  the present study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which SiNPs enhanced autophagosome synthesis  which then contributed to autophagy dysfunction. First  the effects of SiNPs on autophagy and autophagic flux were verified using transmission electron microscopy  laser scanning confocal microscopy  and western blot assays. Then  the activation of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress was validated to be through the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways but not the ERN1-XBP1 pathway  along with the upregulation of downstream ATF4 and DDIT3. Thereafter  the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) was used to verify that SiNP-induced autophagy could be influenced by ER stress. Furthermore  specialized lentiviral shRNA were employed to determine that autophagy was induced via specific activation of the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways. Finally  the 2 autophagic genes LC3B and ATG12 were found to be transcriptionally upregulated by downstream ATF4 and DDIT3 in ER stress  which contributed to the SiNP-enhanced autophagosome synthesis. Taken together  these data suggest that SiNPs induced autophagosome accumulation via the activation of the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways in hepatocytes  which offers a new insight into detailed molecular mechanisms underlying SiNP-induced autophagy dysfunction  and specifically how UPR pathways regulate key autophagic genes. This work provides novel evidence for the study of toxic effects and risk assessment of SiNPs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Doxorubicin Regulates Autophagy Signals via Accumulation of Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Human Cardiac Progenitor Cells.Doxorubicin (DOXO) is widely used to treat solid tumors. However  its clinical use is limited by side effects including serious cardiotoxicity due to cardiomyocyte damage. Resident cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) act as key regulators of homeostasis in myocardial cells. However  little is known about the function of hCPCs in DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity. In this study  we found that DOXO-mediated hCPC toxicity is closely related to calcium-related autophagy signaling and was significantly attenuated by blocking mTOR signaling in human hCPCs. DOXO induced hCPC apoptosis with reduction of SMP30 (regucalcin) and autophagosome marker LC3  as well as remarkable induction of the autophagy-related markers  Beclin-1  APG7  and P62/SQSTM1 and induction of calcium-related molecules  CaM (Calmodulin) and CaMKII (Calmodulin kinase II). The results of an LC3 puncta assay further indicated that DOXO reduced autophagosome formation via accumulation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Additionally  DOXO significantly induced mTOR expression in hCPCs  and inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin  a specific inhibitor  rescued DOXO-mediated autophagosome depletion in hCPCs with significant reduction of DOXO-mediated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in hCPCs  and restored SMP30 and mTOR expression. Thus  DOXO-mediated hCPC toxicity is linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related autophagy signaling  and inhibition of mTOR signaling may provide a cardio-protective effect against DOXO-mediated hCPC toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anticancer and antibacterial activity in vitro evaluation of iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes.Three iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes [Ir(ppy)<sub>2</sub>(PYTA)](PF<sub>6</sub>) (1) (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine)  [Ir(bzq)<sub>2</sub>(PYTA)](PF<sub>6</sub>) (2) (bzq = benzo[h]quinolone) and [Ir(piq)<sub>2</sub>(PYTA)](PF<sub>6</sub>) (3) (piq = 1-phenylisoquinoline  PYTA = 2 4-diamino-6-(2'-pyridyl)-1 3 5-triazine) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis  IR  <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR. The cytotoxic activity of the complexes toward cancer SGC-7901  Eca-109  A549  HeLa  HepG2  BEL-7402 and normal LO2 cell lines was investigated by 3-(4 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Complex 3 shows the most effective on inhibiting the above cell growth among these complexes. The complexes locate at the lysosomes and mitochondria. AO/EB  Annex V and PI and comet assays indicate that the complexes can induce apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. Intracellular ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential were examined under fluorescence microscopy. The results demonstrate that the complexes increase the intracellular ROS levels and induce a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The complexes can enhance intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and cause a release of cytochrome c. The autophagy was studied using MDC staining and western blot. Complexes 1-3 can effectively inhibit the cell invasion with a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally  the complexes target tubules and inhibit the polymerization of tubules. The antimicrobial activity of the complexes against S. aureus  E. coli  Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was explored. The mechanism shows that the complexes induce apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells through ROS-mediated lysosomal-mitochondrial  targeting tubules and damage DNA pathways. Three iridium(III) complexes [Ir(N-C)<sub>2</sub>(PYTA)](PF<sub>6</sub>) (N-C = ppy  1; bzq  2; piq  3) were synthesized and characterized. The anticancer activity of the complexes against SGC-7901 cells was studied by apoptosis  comet assay  autophagy  ROS  mitochondrial membrane potential  intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels  release of cytochrome c  tubules and western blot analysis.

Alterations of autophagy in knee cartilage by treatment with treadmill exercise in a rat osteoarthritis model.The aim of the present study was to investigate potential alterations in the articular cartilage in a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)‑induced osteoarthritis (OA) with or without treatment with moderate treadmill exercise. A total of 30 male Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=10)  including the control  OA and OA with treadmill exercise (OAE) groups. Rats were evaluated upon completing the treadmill exercise program (speed  18 m/min; 30 min/day; 5 days/week for 4 weeks). Interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑4 levels in the serum and intra‑articular lavage fluid (IALF) were measured by ELISA. Alterations in articular cartilage and synovium were also evaluated by histology  immunohistochemistry  western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that IL‑1β in the serum and IALF decreased in the OAE group  whereas IL‑4 increased  and histological evaluation indicated that the OAE group had a clear treatment response. However  the expression of type II collagen in the articular cartilage increased in the OAE group as compared with the OA group  whereas ADAMTS5 expression decreased. In contrast to light chain 3B (LC3B)  the protein expression levels of BECLIN1 and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) were increased in the OA group. In addition  a significant increase was observed between OA and OAE groups in LC3B and SQSTM1 protein levels  whereas no change was observed in BECLIN1 levels between the OA and OAE groups in the superficial and deep zones. The results of western blotting demonstrated that LC3II was notably decreased in the OA group and partially increased in the OAE group. The mRNA expression levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 increased in the OA and OAE groups  with a significant difference observed between the two groups  while a concomitant decrease was detected in BECLIN1 levels. In conclusion  30 min of treadmill exercise had an evident protective effect in the articular cartilage of rats with MIA‑induced OA and may promote autophagy in the articular cartilage.,Autophagy_notLIR
Human aortic smooth muscle cell-derived exosomal miR-221/222 inhibits autophagy via a PTEN/Akt signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Dysregulation of autophagy in endothelial cells plays a vital role in cardiovascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence shows that miRNAs regulate autophagy in various cell types by targeting autophagy-related genes. In the present study  we found that a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) inhibited autophagy activity in HUVECs. Furthermore  we isolated exosomes secreted by HAoSMCs  and confirmed that the exosomes contain miR-221/222. We investigated the role of miR-221/222 transferred by HAoSMC-derived exosomes in HUVECs. These exosomes induced an increase of miR-221/222 expression and a down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in HUVECs. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-221/222 could bind to the 3'UTR of PTEN  which implied that PTEN was a direct target of miR-221/222. The expression of PTEN could be down-regulated by miR-221/222 over-expression. Then  we detected the expression of PTEN  LC3  ATG5  SQSTM1/p62  Beclin-1  Akt  and phospho-Akt in HUVECs transfected with miR-221/222 mimics and inhibitors. Our results demonstrated that miR-221/222 overexpression inhibited the expression of PTEN and subsequently activated Akt signaling  and eventually down-regulated the expression of LC3II  ATG5 and Beclin-1  and elevated the expression of SQSTM1/p62. This phenomenon can be reversed by the transfection of miR-221/222 inhibitors. These data suggested that miR-221/222 from HAoSMC-derived exosomes inhibited autophagy in HUVECs by modulating PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Presynaptic endocytic factors in autophagy and neurodegeneration.Neuronal signaling depends on the exocytic fusion and subsequent endocytic retrieval and reformation of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles at synapses. Recent findings have uncovered surprising roles of presynaptic endocytic proteins in the formation and transport of autophagosomes. These include functions of the membrane remodelling protein endophilin and its downstream effector  the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin  in autophagosome formation and in Parkinson's disease  the endocytic sorting adaptor CALM in protein degradation via the autophagy/lysosomal pathway in Alzheimer's disease  and the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 in retrograde transport of signaling autophagosomes to prevent neurodegeneration. These findings reveal unanticipated connections between the machineries for synaptic neurotransmission and neuronal proteostasis and identify presynaptic endocytic proteins as potential targets to treat neurodegenerative diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification and expression of genes in response to cassava bacterial blight infection.Cassava bacterial blight (CBB) caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (or XAM) is a serious disease of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). In this study  quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with CBB infection were identified in the F1 progenies of a cross between the "Huay Bong 60" and "Hanatee" cassava cultivars. The phenotype of disease severity was observed at 7  10  and 12 days after inoculation (DAI). A total of 12 QTL were identified  of which 5  6  and 1 were detected in 7  10  and 12 DAI samples  respectively. Among all identified QTL  CBB14_10dai_1  CBB14_10dai_2  and CBB14_12dai showed the most significant (P < 0.0001) associations with CBB infection  and explained 21.3  13.8  and 26.5% of phenotypic variation  respectively. Genes underlying the QTL were identified and their expression was investigated in resistant and susceptible cassava plants by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The results identified candidate genes that showed significant differences in expression between resistant and susceptible lines  including brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1-related (Manes.04G059100)  cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel 2 (Manes.02G051100)  and autophagy-related protein 8a-related (Manes.17G026600) at 7 DAI  and regulator of nonsense transcripts 1 homolog (Manes.17G021900) at both 7 and 12 DAI. The expression pattern of all genes showed higher levels in resistant (B82  B32  B20  and B70) as compared to susceptible (HB60  B100  B95  and B47) plants. Overall  this study has identified QTL and markers linked to CBB infection trait  and identified candidate genes involved in CBB resistance. This information will be of use for better understanding defense mechanisms in cassava to bacterial blight disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
mTOR  cardiomyocytes and inflammation in cardiac hypertrophy.Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionary conserved kinase that senses the nutrient and energy status of cells  the availability of growth factors  stress stimuli and other cellular and environmental cues. It responds by regulating a range of cellular processes related to metabolism and growth in accordance with the available resources and intracellular needs. mTOR has distinct functions depending on its assembly in the structurally distinct multiprotein complexes mTORC1 or mTORC2. Active mTORC1 enhances processes including glycolysis  protein  lipid and nucleotide biosynthesis  and it inhibits autophagy. Reported functions for mTORC2 after growth factor stimulation are very diverse  are tissue and cell-type specific  and include insulin-stimulated glucose transport and enhanced glycogen synthesis. In accordance with its cellular functions  mTOR has been demonstrated to regulate cardiac growth in response to pressure overload and is also known to regulate cells of the immune system. The present manuscript presents recently obtained insights into mechanisms whereby mTOR may change anabolic  catabolic and stress response pathways in cardiomocytes and discusses how mTOR may affect inflammatory cells in the heart during hemodynamic stress.

Chaperone-like protein HYPK and its interacting partners augment autophagy.To decipher the function(s) of HYPK  a huntingtin (HTT)-interacting protein with chaperone-like activity  we had previously identified 36 novel interacting partners of HYPK. Another 13 proteins were known earlier to be associated with HYPK. On the basis of analysis of the interacting partners of HYPK  it has been shown that HYPK may participate in diverse cellular functions relevant to Huntington's disease. In the present study  we identified additional 5 proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization. As of now we have 54 primary interactors of HYPK. From the database we collected 1026 unique proteins (secondary interactors) interacting with these 54 primary HYPK interacting partners. We observed that 10 primary and 91 secondary interacting proteins of HYPK are associated with two types of autophagy processes. We next tested the hypothesis that the hub  HYPK  might itself be involved in autophagy. Using mouse striatal STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) cell lines  we observed that over expression of HYPK significantly increased background cellular autophagy  while knock down of endogenous HYPK decreased the autophagy level as detected by altered LC3I conversion  BECN1 expression  cleavage of GFP from LC3-GFP  ATG5-ATG12 conjugate formation and expression of transcription factors like Tfeb  Srebp2 and Zkscan3. This result shows that HYPK  possibly with its interacting partners  induces autophagy. We further observed that N-terminal mutant HTT reduced the cellular levels of LC3II and BECN1  which could be recovered significantly upon over expression of HYPK in these cells. This result further confirms that HYPK could also be involved in clearing mutant HTT aggregates by augmenting autophagy pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cinobufacini promotes apoptosis of bladder cancer cells by influencing the expression of autophagy-related genes.The effects of cinobufacini on apoptosis of human bladder cancer T24 cells and the expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins were studied. The human bladder cancer T24 cells were selected  and the inhibitory effect of cinobufacini on the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells was detected by cell viability assay. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to detect the changes in the apoptosis of bladder cancer cells after being treated with cinobufacini; the changes in the expression levels of human bladder cancer cell apoptosis-related genes and proteins  cleaved caspase-3  Bax  B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and autophagy-related genes and proteins  p62  light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7) after treatment with cinobufacini were detected by western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 3-(4 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results showed that 0.1 mg/ml cinobufacini significantly inhibited the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells cultured <i>in vitro</i> (P<0.01)  and it was dose- and time-dependent. Both flow cytometry and Hoechst staining showed that cinobufacini promoted the apoptosis of cells (P<0.01)  and the level of cell apoptosis increased with the increase of drug concentration. Both western blot analysis and RT-PCR showed that cinobufacini could decrease the expression level of Bcl-2 in T24 cells (P<0.01)  increase the expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 (P<0.01)  increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 (P<0.01)  upregulate the expression level of the angiotensin-related protein p62 (P<0.01)  reduce the ratio of LC3-II/I (P<0.01) and decrease the expression level of Atg7 (P<0.01). After treatment with rapamycin  the expression levels of Bcl-2  Bax  cleaved caspase-3  autophagy-related genes and proteins  p62  LC3-II/I and Atg7 were similar to those in the control group. Cinobufacini can inhibit the autophagy activation of bladder cancer cells  thus promoting apoptosis of bladder cancer T24 cells and inhibiting the proliferation of T24 cells  which may provide a theoretical basis for the development of new anti-bladder cancer drugs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-related approaches for improving nutrient use efficiency and crop yield protection.Autophagy is a eukaryotic catabolic pathway essential for growth and development. In plants  it is activated in response to environmental cues or developmental stimuli. However  in contrast to other eukaryotic systems  we know relatively little regarding the molecular players involved in autophagy and the regulation of this complex pathway. In the framework of the COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) action TRANSAUTOPHAGY (2016-2020)  we decided to review our current knowledge of autophagy responses in higher plants  with emphasis on knowledge gaps. We also assess here the potential of translating the acquired knowledge to improve crop plant growth and development in a context of growing social and environmental challenges for agriculture in the near future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is a mechanistic link between increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy in the placentas of pregnancies complicated by growth restriction.Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy have been noted in the placentas of pregnancies complicated by idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); however  the cause of these phenomena remains unclear. We surmised that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) may increase ER stress and autophagy and that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is involved in regulating placental ER stress and autophagy in pregnancies complicated by IUGR.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mutation-dependent aggregation and toxicity in a Drosophila model for UBQLN2-associated ALS.Members of the conserved ubiquilin (UBQLN) family of ubiquitin (Ub) chaperones harbor an antipodal UBL (Ub-like)-UBA (Ub-associated) domain arrangement and participate in proteasome and autophagosome-mediated protein degradation. Mutations in a proline-rich-repeat region (PRR) of UBQLN2 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD); however  neither the normal functions of the PRR nor impacts of ALS-associated mutations within it are well understood. In this study  we show that ALS mutations perturb UBQLN2 solubility and folding in a mutation-specific manner. Biochemical impacts of ALS mutations were additive  transferable to UBQLN1  and resulted in enhanced Ub association. A Drosophila melanogaster model for UBQLN2-associated ALS revealed that both wild-type and ALS-mutant UBQLN2 alleles disrupted Ub homeostasis; however  UBQLN2ALS mutants exhibited age-dependent aggregation and caused toxicity phenotypes beyond those seen for wild-type UBQLN2. Although UBQLN2 toxicity was not correlated with aggregation in the compound eye  aggregation-prone UBQLN2 mutants elicited climbing defects and neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) abnormalities when expressed in neurons. An UBA domain mutation that abolished Ub binding also diminished UBQLN2 toxicity  implicating Ub binding in the underlying pathomechanism. We propose that ALS-associated mutations in UBQLN2 disrupt folding and that both aggregated species and soluble oligomers instigate neuron autonomous toxicity through interference with Ub homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Gossypol induces cell death by activating apoptosis and autophagy in HT-29 cells.Gossypol is a polyphenolic  yellowish compound derived from cottonseed extract. The present study examined the effects of gossypol on the apoptosis and autophagy of HT‑29 cells. A Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay  Annexin V‑FITC  JC‑1 staining and western blotting were used to identify the viability of cells  stages of apoptosis and the expression levels of the signaling proteins. Gossypol promoted apoptosis and induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Further investigation of the apoptotic mechanism revealed that gossypol increased the ratio of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein/Bcl‑2 protein levels and upregulated the expression of caspase‑3. Gossypol also enhanced the activity of microtubule‑associated protein light chain 3 LC3‑II and Beclin‑1 and downregulated LC3‑I  in a dose‑dependent manner. Together  these finding suggested that gossypol may be a novel and potential antitumor agent.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and inflammation.Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism involved in the disposal of damaged organelles  denatured proteins as well as invaded pathogens through a lysosomal degradation pathway. Recently  increasing evidences have demonstrated its role in both innate and adaptive immunity  and thereby influence the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The detection of autophagy machinery facilitated the measurement of autophagy during physiological and pathophysiological processes. Autophagy plays critical roles in inflammation through influencing the development  homeostasis and survival of inflammatory cells  including macrophages  neutrophils and lymphocytes; effecting the transcription  processing and secretion of a number of cytokines  as well as being regulated by cytokines. Recently  autophagy-dependent mechanisms have been studied in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases  including infectious diseases  Crohn's disease  cystic fibrosis  pulmonary hypertension  chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and so on. These studies suggested that modulation of autophagy might lead to therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with inflammation. Here we highlight recent advances in investigating the roles of autophagy in inflammation as well as inflammatory diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of nutrient recycling via autophagy.Autophagy is a universal mechanism in eukaryotes that promotes cell longevity and nutrient recycling through the degradation of unwanted organelles  proteins and damaged cytoplasmic compounds. Autophagy is important in plant resistance to stresses and starvations and in remobilization. Autophagy facilitates bulk and selective degradations  through the delivery of cell material to the vacuole where hydrolases and proteases reside. Large metabolite modifications are observed in autophagy mutants showing the important role of autophagy in cell homeostasis. The control of autophagic activity by nutrients and energy status is supported by several studies in plant and animal. We review how autophagy contributes to nutrient management in plants and how nutrient status control this degradation pathway for adaptation to the environment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Defective autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells enhances atherosclerotic plaque instability.Autophagy is considered as an evolutionarily conserved cellular catabolic process. Defective autophagy has been implicated in various human diseases  including cardiovascular diseases. Recently  we and others demonstrated that defective autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) promotes the progression of atherosclerosis. In this study  we investigated the role of autophagy in SMCs on plaque instability in vivo. We generated mice with a defect atg7in which is an essential gene for autophagy  in SMCs by crossing Atg7<sup>f/f</sup> mice with transgelin (Tagln) Cre<sup>+/0</sup> mice (Atg7cKO). Then  Atg7cKO and apolipoprotein E (apoe)-deficient (apoeKO) mice were crossed to generate Atg7cKO:apoeKO mice. To generate a mouse model of plaque instability  we conducted to form a tandem stenosis in the carotid artery of Atg7cKO:apoeKO mice and their controls (apoeKO mice) at the age of 10 weeks. At 5 weeks after surgery  the percentage of cross-sectional stenosis area in the operated common carotid artery of Atg7cKO:apoeKO mice was significantly higher than that in apoeKO mice. In addition  thrombus  which was not observed in apoeKO mice  was frequently found in Atg7cKO:apoeKO mice. Furthermore  the number of Berlin blue staining-positive areas  which indicated intraplaque hemorrhage  was significantly higher in Atg7cKO:apoeKO mice than in control apoeKO mice. Taken together  our data suggest that defective autophagy in SMCs enhances plaque instability and the risk of plaque rupture.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptor ligands induce apoptosis and autophagy but have opposite effect on cell proliferation in uveal melanoma.Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults  with about 1200-1500 new cases occurring per year in the United States. Metastasis is a frequent occurrence in uveal melanoma  and outcomes are poor once distant spread occurs and no clinically significant chemotherapeutic protocol is so far available. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of various σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub> receptor ligands as a possible pharmacological strategy for this rare tumor. Human uveal melanoma cells (92.1) were treated with various concentrations of different σ<sub>2</sub> ligands (haloperidol and haloperidol metabolite II) and σ<sub>1</sub> ligand ((+)-pentazocine) at various concentrations (1  10 and 25 μM) and time points (0  4 h  8 h  24 h and 48 h). Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated respectively by continuous cell monitoring by xCELLigence analysis  clonogenic assay and wound healing. Apoptosis and autophagy were also measured by cytofluorimetric and microscopy analysis. Our results showed that σ<sub>2</sub> receptor ligands significantly reduced cell proliferation whereas (+)-pentazocine exhibited opposite results. All tested ligands showed significant decrease in cell migration. Interestingly  both σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub> receptor ligands showed significant increase of autophagy and apoptosis at all concentrations. Taken all together these results suggest that sigma receptors mediates opposite biological effects but they also share common pharmacological effect on apoptosis and autophagy in uveal melanoma. In conclusion  these data provide the first evidence that sigma receptors may represent a "druggable" target to develop new chemotherapic agent for uveal melanoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Programmed cell death: the battlefield between the host and alpha-herpesviruses and a potential avenue for cancer treatment.Programed cell death is an antiviral mechanism by which the host limits viral replication and protects uninfected cells. Many viruses encode proteins resistant to programed cell death to escape the host immune defenses  which indicates that programed cell death is more favorable for the host immune defense. Alpha-herpesviruses are pathogens that widely affect the health of humans and animals in different communities worldwide. Alpha-herpesviruses can induce apoptosis  autophagy and necroptosis through different molecular mechanisms. This review concisely illustrates the different pathways of apoptosis  autophagy  and necroptosis induced by alpha-herpesviruses. These pathways influence viral infection and replication and are a potential avenue for cancer treatment. This review will increase our understanding of the role of programed cell death in the host immune defense and provides new possibilities for cancer treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
The roles of phosphoinositides in mammalian autophagy.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process for lysosomal degradation  which is involved in various physiological processes within cells. Its dysfunction is associated with many human diseases  such as cancer  liver diseases  heart diseases  and infectious diseases  including neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy involves the formation of a double-membrane bound autophagosome and the degradation of cytosolic components via its fusion and maturation with the lysosome. One of the most important steps in the process of autophagy is membrane biogenesis during autophagosome formation/maturation from different membrane sources within cells. However  there is limited knowledge regarding: (1) how the core autophagy machinery is recruited to the initial site to initiate the formation of the isolation membrane and (2) how the autophagosome matures into the functional autolysosome. Lipid supply for nucleation/elongation of the autophagosome has been proposed as one possible mechanism. Accumulating evidence suggests the important role of phosphoinositides as phospholipids  which represent key membrane-localized signals in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes  in autophagosome formation and maturation. This review focuses on how phosphoinositides influence autophagy induction or autophagosome biogenesis/maturation  because the way they are altered by autophagy might contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aging-related Repositioned Drugs  Donepezil and Sildenafil Citrate  Increase Apoptosis of Anti-mitotic Drug-resistant KBV20C Cells Through Different Molecular Mechanisms.The study focused on identifying the mechanisms or drugs that could sensitize P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing resistant KBV20C cancer cells to halaven (HAL) or vincristine (VIC) treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy: a new target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease therapy.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has gained importance in recent decades due to drastic changes in diet  especially in Western countries. NAFLD occurs as a spectrum from simple hepatic steatosis  steatohepatitis to cirrhosis  and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of NAFLD have been intensively investigated  many issues remain to be resolved. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism for disposing of excess or defective organelles  and has become a hot spot for research. Recent studies have revealed that autophagy is linked to the development of NAFLD and regulation of autophagy has therapeutic potential. Autophagy reduces intracellular lipid droplets by enclosing them and fusing with lysosomes for degradation. Furthermore  autophagy is involved in attenuating inflammation and liver injury. However  autophagy is regarded as a double-edged sword  as it may also affect adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. Moreover  it is unclear as to whether autophagy protects the body from injury or causes diseases and even death  and the association between autophagy and NAFLD remains controversial. This review is intended to discuss  comment  and outline the progress made in this field and establish the possible molecular mechanism involved.,Autophagy_notLIR
Depigmentation of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-treated melanoma cells by β-mangostin is mediated by selective autophagy.Melanogenesis is a key pathway for the regulation of skin pigmentation and the development of skin-lightening/skin-whitening drugs or cosmetics. In this study  we found that β-mangostin from seedcases of Garcinia mangostana inhibited α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-mediated melanogenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells and a three-dimensional human skin model. β-Mangostin significantly inhibited the protein level of tyrosinase induced by α-MSH in UPS (ubiquitin proteasome system)-independent and lysosome-dependent manner. The inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine treatment or ATG5 knockdown effectively recovered premelanosome protein as well as tyrosinase degraded by the β-mangostin treatment. However  rapamycin  a representative non-selective autophagy inducer  triggered autophagy in α-MSH-stimulated cells  which was characterized by a considerable decrease in p62  but it was unable to inhibit melanogenesis. Melanosome-engulfing autophagosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore  previously formed melanin could be degraded effectively in an autophagy-dependent manner in β-mangostin-treated cells. Taken together  our results suggest that β-mangostin inhibits the melanogenesis induced by α-MSH via an autophagy-dependent mechanism  and thus  the depigmentation effect of β-mangostin may depend on autophagy targeted at the melanosome rather than non-selective autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sulforaphane promotes ER stress  autophagy  and cell death: implications for cataract surgery.Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) commonly develops following cataract surgery and is a wound-healing response that can ultimately lead to secondary visual loss. Improved management of this problem is required. The isothiocyanate  sulforaphane (SFN)  is reported to exert cytoprotective and cytotoxic actions  and the latter may be exploited to treat/prevent PCO. SFN concentrations of 10 μM and above significantly impaired wound-healing in a human lens capsular bag model. A similar pattern of response was also seen with a human lens cell line  FHL124. SFN treatment promoted increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes  which also corresponded with protein expression. Evidence of autophagy was observed in response to SFN as determined by increased microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II levels and detection of autophagic vesicles. This response was disrupted by established autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and 3-MA. SFN was found to promote MAPK signaling  and inhibition of ERK activation using U0126 prevented SFN-induced LC3-II elevation and vesicle formation. SFN also significantly increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Taken together  our findings suggest that SFN is capable of reducing lens cell growth and viability and thus could serve as a putative therapeutic agent for PCO.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cross-Talk Between Sirtuin 1 and High-Mobility Box 1 in Steatotic Liver Graft Preservation.Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide +-dependent histone deacetylase that regulates various pathways involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Moreover  high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) has also been involved in inflammatory processes during IRI. However  the roles of both SIRT1 and HMGB1 in liver preservation is poorly understood. In this communication  we evaluated the potential relationship between SIRT1 and HMGB1 in steatotic and non-steatotic liver grafts preserved in Institute Georges Lopez solution (IGL-1) preservation solution enriched or not enriched with trimetazidine (TMZ).,Autophagy_notLIR
Why is there selective subcortical vulnerability in ADHD? Clues from postmortem brain gene expression data.Sub-cortical volumetric differences were associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a recent multi-site  mega-analysis of 1713 ADHD persons and 1529 controls. As there was a wide range of effect sizes among the sub-cortical volumes  it is possible that selective neuronal vulnerability has a role in these volumetric losses. To address this possibility  we used data from Allen Brain Atlas to investigate variability in gene expression profiles between subcortical regions of typically developing brains. We tested the hypothesis that the expression of genes in a set of curated ADHD candidate genes and five a priori selected  biological pathways would be associated with the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) findings. Across the subcortical regions studied by ENIGMA  gene expression profiles for three pathways were significantly correlated with ADHD-associated volumetric reductions: apoptosis  oxidative stress and autophagy. These correlations were strong and significant for children with ADHD  but not for adults. Although preliminary  these data suggest that variability of structural brain anomalies in ADHD can be explained  in part  by the differential vulnerability of these regions to mechanisms mediating apoptosis  oxidative stress and autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy and mitophagy in hepatocarcinogenesis.Autophagy is required for benign hepatic tumors to progress into malignant hepatocellular carcinoma.

<i>Acanthamoeba</i> and <i>Dictyostelium</i> as Cellular Models for <i>Legionella</i> Infection.Environmental bacteria of the genus <i>Legionella</i> naturally parasitize free-living amoebae. Upon inhalation of bacteria-laden aerosols  the opportunistic pathogens grow intracellularly in alveolar macrophages and can cause a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. Intracellular replication in amoebae and macrophages takes place in a unique membrane-bound compartment  the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system  which translocates literally hundreds of "effector" proteins into host cells  where they modulate crucial cellular processes for the pathogen's benefit. The mechanism of LCV formation appears to be evolutionarily conserved  and therefore  amoebae are not only ecologically significant niches for <i>Legionella</i> spp.  but also useful cellular models for eukaryotic phagocytes. In particular  <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> and <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> emerged over the last years as versatile and powerful models. Using genetic  biochemical and cell biological approaches  molecular interactions between amoebae and <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> have recently been investigated in detail with a focus on the role of phosphoinositide lipids  small and large GTPases  autophagy components and the retromer complex  as well as on bacterial effectors targeting these host factors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Octreotide Attenuates Acute Kidney Injury after Hepatic Ischemia and Reperfusion by Enhancing Autophagy.Octreotide exerts a protective effect in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (HIR) injury. However  whether octreotide preconditioning could also reduce acute kidney injury (AKI) after HIR is unknown. This study was designed to investigate the role of octreotide in AKI after HIR. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with octreotide or octreotide combined with 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor  3MA). Plasma creatinine  inflammation markers (e.g.  TNF-α and IL-6 etc.)  apoptosis  autophagy and phosphorylation of protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (Akt/mTOR/p70S6K) in the kidney were measured after 60 minutes of liver ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion for each rat. Octreotide pretreatment significantly preserved renal function and reduced the severity of renal injury. Moreover  octreotide alleviated inflammation and apoptosis in the kidney after HIR. Additionally  octreotide induced autophagy and autophagy inhibition with 3MA markedly reversed the renoprotective  anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of octreotide after HIR. Finally  octreotide abrogated the activation of phosphorylation of Akt  mTOR and p70S6K in the kidney after HIR. Our results indicate that octreotide reduced renal injury after HIR due to its induction of autophagy. The enhancement of autophagy may be potentially linked to the octreotide mediated Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway deactivation and reduction of kidney inflammation and apoptosis after HIR.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy prevention sensitizes AKTi-1/2-induced anti-hepatocellular carcinoma cell activity in vitro and in vivo.Molecule-targeted therapy has become the research focus for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Persistent PI3K-AKT activation is often detected in HCC  representing a valuable oncotarget for treatment. Here  we tested the anti-HCC activity by a potent AKT inhibitor: AKT inhibitor 1/2 (AKTi-1/2). In both established (HepG2 and Huh-7) and primary human HCC cells  treatment with AKTi-1/2 inhibited cell survival and proliferation  but induced cell apoptosis. AKTi-1/2 blocked AKT-mTOR activation  yet simultaneously provoked cytoprotective autophagy in HCC cells. The latter was evidenced by ATG-5 and Beclin-1 upregulation  p62 downregulation as well as LC3B-GFP puncta formation. Autophagy inhibition  via pharmacological inhibitors (3-methyladenine  ammonium chloride  and bafilomycin A1) or Beclin-1 siRNA knockdown  significantly potentiated AKTi-1/2-induced HepG2 cell death and apoptosis. In nude mice  AKTi-1/2 intraperitoneal injection inhibited HepG2 tumor growth. Significantly  its anti-tumor activity in vivo was further sensitized when combined with Beclin-1 shRNA knockdown in HepG2 tumors. Together  these results demonstrate that autophagy activation serves as a main resistance factor of AKTi-1/2 in HCC cells. Autophagy prevention therefore sensitizes AKTi-1/2-induced anti-HCC activity in vitro and in vivo.,Autophagy_notLIR
ROCK1 Is Associated with Alzheimer's Disease-Specific Plaques  as well as Enhances Autophagosome Formation But not Autophagic Aβ Clearance.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of late-life dementia in the population  characterized by amyloid plaque formation and increased tau deposition  which is modulated by Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 1 (ROCK1). In this study  we further analyze whether ROCK1 regulates the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP). We show that ROCK1 is colocalized with mature amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in patients with AD  in that ROCK1 enhances the amyloidogenic pathway  and that ROCK1 mediated autophagy enhances the intracellular buildup of Aβ in a cell model of AD (confirmed by increased ROCK1 and decreased Beclin 1 protein levels  with neuronal autophagosome accumulation in prefrontal cortex of AD APP/PS1 mouse model). <i>In vitro</i> over-expression of ROCK1 leads to a decrease in Aβ secretion and an increase in the expression of autophagy-related molecules. ROCK1 interacts with Beclin1  an autophagy initiator  and enhances the intracellular accumulation of Aβ. Reciprocally  overexpression of APP/Aβ promotes ROCK1 expression. Our data suggest ROCK1 participates in regulating Aβ secretion  APP shedding and autophagosome accumulation  and that ROCK1  rather than other kinases  is more likely to be a targetable enzyme for AD therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
mTORC1 and Nutrient Homeostasis: The Central Role of the Lysosome.The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates cellular growth and metabolism with environmental inputs to ensure that cells grow only under favourable conditions. When active  mTORC1 stimulates biosynthetic pathways including protein  lipid and nucleotide synthesis and inhibits cellular catabolism through repression of the autophagic pathway  thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation. The recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface has been shown to be essential for its activation. This finding has significantly enhanced our knowledge of mTORC1 regulation and has focused the attention of the field on the lysosome as a signalling hub which coordinates several homeostatic pathways. The intriguing localisation of mTORC1 to the cellular organelle that plays a crucial role in catabolism enables mTORC1 to feedback to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis  thus leading mTORC1 to enact precise spatial and temporal control of cell growth. This review will cover the signalling interactions which take place on the surface of lysosomes and the cross-talk which exists between mTORC1 activity and lysosomal function.,Autophagy_notLIR
Striking phenotypic variation in a family with the P506S UBQLN2 mutation including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  spastic paraplegia  and frontotemporal dementia.Analysis of 226 exome-sequenced UK cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia identified 2 individuals who harbored a P497H and P506S UBQLN2 mutation  respectively (n = 0.9%). The P506S index case presented with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia at the age of 54 years then progressed to ALS surviving 3 years. Three sons presented with (1) slowly progressive pure spastic paraplegia with an onset at 25 years and (2) ALS with disease onset of 25 years and survival of 2 years  and (3) ALS presenting symptoms at the age of 26 years  respectively. Analysis of postmortem tissue from the index case revealed frequent neuronal cytoplasmic UBQLN2-positive inclusions in the dentate gyrus and TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the frontal and temporal cortex and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Furthermore  a comprehensive analysis of published UBQLN2 mutations demonstrated that only proline-rich domain mutations contribute to a significantly earlier age of onset in male patients (p = 0.0026).,Autophagy_notLIR
Suppressing autophagy enhances disulfiram/copper-induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer.Autophagy  a cellular survival mechanism  is thought to allow the recycling of cellular breakdown products when cancer cells are subjected to chemotherapy  thus decreasing drug-induced apoptosis. Disulfiram (DSF)  a drug widely used to control alcoholism  possesses anticancer activity by inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in a copper (Cu)-dependent manner. Our previous studies proved that DSF/Cu exerts increased anti-tumor effects on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft models  and inhibits NSCLC recurrence driven by ALDH-positive cancer stem cells. The present study is designed to investigate whether DSF/Cu can induce autophagy in NSCLC cells and to determine the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. First  we observed that DSF/Cu induced significant cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis in NSCLC cells  accompanied by the formation of vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Next  we investigated the levels of autophagic markers  including LC3II (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)  ATG5 and p62 with or without chloroquine by Western blot. In addition  we observed co-localization of LC3 and the lysosomal protein LAMP2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2) after treatment with DSF/Cu. The results showed that DSF/Cu induced autophagy. Finally  we demonstrated that DSF/Cu-induced apoptosis was greatly enhanced when autophagy was suppressed with Atg5 siRNA or 3-MA in NSCLC cells. This synergistic effect of DSF/Cu and 3-MA was further confirmed in the NSCLC xenograft model. Taken together  our results show that DSF/Cu stimulates autophagy in NSCLC cells  which is an impediment to DSF/Cu-induced apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of AMPK in cardiomyocyte health and survival.Cellular energy homeostasis is a fundamental process that governs the overall health of the cell and is paramount to cell survival. Central to this is the control of ATP generation and utilization  which is regulated by a complex myriad of enzymatic reactions controlling cellular metabolism. In the cardiomyocyte  ATP generated from substrate catabolism is used for numerous cellular processes including maintaining ionic homeostasis  cell repair  protein synthesis and turnover  organelle turnover  and contractile function. In many instances  cardiovascular disease is associated with impaired cardiac energetics and thus the signalling that regulates pathways involved in cardiomyocyte metabolism may be potential targets for pharmacotherapy designed to help treat cardiovascular disease. An important regulator of cardiomyocyte energy homeostasis is adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a serine-threonine kinase that functions primarily as a metabolic sensor to coordinate anabolic and catabolic activities in the cell via the phosphorylation of multiple proteins involved in metabolic pathways. In addition to the direct role that AMPK plays in the regulation of cardiomyocyte metabolism  AMPK can also either directly or indirectly influence other cellular processes such as regulating mitochondrial function  post-translation acetylation  autophagy  mitophagy  endoplasmic reticulum stress  and apoptosis. Thus  AMPK is implicated in the control of a wide variety of cellular processes that can influence cardiomyocyte health and survival. In this review  we will discuss the important role that AMPK plays in regulating cardiac metabolism  as well as the additional cellular processes that may contribute to cardiomyocyte function and survival in the healthy and the diseased heart.

Artemisinin derivatives inhibit epithelial ovarian cancer cells via autophagy-mediated cell cycle arrest.Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynecologic malignancy due to its late diagnosis and lack of curative therapy. The antimalaria compound artemisinin and its derivatives  such as artesunate (ART) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA)  have proven to be potent anticancer drugs and act through various anticancer mechanisms. To identify novel targets of artemisinin derivatives in EOC cells  we investigated the effects of ART and DHA on SKOV3 and primary EOC cell growth via CCK-8 assay. Both ART and DHA inhibited EOC cell growth. A cell cycle distribution analysis showed that ART and DHA caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover  ART and DHA induced autophagy in EOC cells  whereas autophagy inhibitors reversed the cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest induced by ART and DHA. Western blot analysis showed that ART and DHA also suppressed the cell cycle-related NF-κB-signaling pathway in EOC cells. These data suggest that artemisinin derivatives induce autophagy  block the cell cycle  and inhibit cell growth in EOC cells. Our research provides new targets for artemisinin derivatives for EOC treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
ATG proteins: Are we always looking at autophagy?Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway that is regulated by the autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. For a long time it has been thought that ATG proteins were exclusively required for autophagy  but recent experimental evidence has revealed that these proteins are part of other cellular pathways  individually or as a functional group. To estimate the extent of these so-called unconventional functions of the ATG proteins  we decided to perform an unbiased siRNA screen targeting the entire ATG proteome and used viral replication as the readout. Our results have uncovered that a surprisingly high number of ATG proteins (36%) have a positive or negative role in promoting virus replication outside their classical role in autophagy. With the increasing knowledge about ATG protein unconventional functions and our investigation results  the interpretations about the possible involvement of autophagy in cellular or organismal functions that solely rely on the depletion of a single ATG protein  should be considered cautiously.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tuberous sclerosis complex.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects multiple organ systems and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of two genes: TSC1 or TSC2. The disorder can affect both adults and children. First described in depth by Bourneville in 1880  it is now estimated that nearly 2 million people are affected by the disease worldwide. The clinical features of TSC are distinctive and can vary widely between individuals  even within one family. Major features of the disease include tumours of the brain  skin  heart  lungs and kidneys  seizures and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders  which can include autism spectrum disorder and cognitive disability. TSC1 (also known as hamartin) and TSC2 (also known as tuberin) form the TSC protein complex that acts as an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway  which in turn plays a pivotal part in regulating cell growth  proliferation  autophagy and protein and lipid synthesis. Remarkable progress in basic and translational research  in addition to several randomized controlled trials worldwide  has led to regulatory approval of the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas  brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis  but further research is needed to establish full indications of therapeutic treatment. In this Primer  we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in the TSC field  including the molecular and cellular basis of the disease  medical management  major knowledge gaps and ongoing research towards a cure.,Autophagy_notLIR
The dual role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in modulating parthanatos and autophagy under oxidative stress in rat cochlear marginal cells of the stria vascularis.Oxidative stress is reported to regulate several apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways in auditory tissues. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) can be activated under oxidative stress  which is the hallmark of parthanatos. Autophagy  which serves either a pro-survival or pro-death function  can also be stimulated by oxidative stress  but the role of autophagy and its relationship with parthanatos underlying this activation in the inner ear remains unknown. In this study  we established an oxidative stress model in vitro by glucose oxidase/glucose (GO/G)  which could continuously generate low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to mimic continuous exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in physiological conditions  for investigation of oxidative stress-induced cell death mechanisms and the regulatory role of PARP-1 in this process. We observed that GO/G induced stria marginal cells (MCs) death via upregulation of PARP-1 expression  accumulation of polyADP-ribose (PAR) polymers  decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)  which all are biochemical features of parthanatos. PARP-1 knockdown rescued GO/G-induced MCs death  as well as abrogated downstream molecular events of PARP-1 activation. In addition  we demonstrated that GO/G stimulated autophagy and PARP-1 knockdown suppressed GO/G-induced autophagy in MCs. Interestingly  autophagy suppression by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) accelerated GO/G-induced parthanatos  indicating a pro-survival function of autophagy in GO/G-induced MCs death. Taken together  these data suggested that PARP-1 played dual roles by modulating parthanatos and autophagy in oxidative stress-induced MCs death  which may be considered as a promising therapeutic target for ameliorating oxidative stress-related hearing disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Multi-kinase inhibitors interact with sildenafil and ERBB1/2/4 inhibitors to kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.We have recently demonstrated that multi-kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and pazopanib can suppress the detection of chaperones by in situ immuno-fluorescence  which is further enhanced by phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Sorafenib and pazopanib inhibited the HSP90 ATPase activity with IC50 values of ~1.0 μM and ~75 nM  respectively. Pazopanib docked in silico with two possible poses into the HSP90 ATP binding pocket. Pazopanib and sildenafil combined to reduce the total protein levels of HSP1H/p105 and c-MYC and to reduce their co-localization. Sorafenib/pazopanib combined with sildenafil in a [GRP78+HSP27] -dependent fashion to: (i) profoundly activate an eIF2α/Beclin1 pathway; (ii) profoundly inactivate mTOR and increase ATG13 phosphorylation  collectively resulting in the formation of toxic autophagosomes. In a fresh PDX isolate of NSCLC combined knock down of [ERBB1+ERBB3] or use of the ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor afatinib altered cell morphology  enhanced ATG13 phosphorylation  inactivated NFκB  and further enhanced [sorafenib/pazopanib + sildenafil] lethality. Identical data to that with afatinib were obtained knocking down PI3K p110α/β or using buparlisib  copanlisib or the specific p110α inhibitor BYL719. Afatinib adapted NSCLC clones were resistant to buparlisib or copanlisib but were more sensitive than control clones to [sorafenib + sildenafil] or [pazopanib + sildenafil]. Lapatinib significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of [regorafenib + sildenafil] in vivo; afatinib and BYL719 enhanced the anti-tumor effects of [sorafenib + sildenafil] and [pazopanib] in vivo  respectively.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY receptors are widely expressed in the mammalian central nervous system. Studies in both humans and rodent models revealed that brain NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative disorders  such as Alzheimer's disease  Parkinson's disease  Huntington's disease and Machado-Joseph disease. In this review  we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of these disorders  highlighting NPY as a neuroprotective agent  as a neural stem cell proliferative agent  as an agent that increases trophic support  as a stimulator of autophagy and as an inhibitor of excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Moreover  the effect of NPY in some clinical manifestations commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease  Parkinson's disease  Huntington's disease and Machado-Joseph disease  such as depressive symptoms and body weight loss  are also discussed. In conclusion  this review highlights NPY system as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Autophagy  autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases].Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus  are the consequence of immunity directed against the organism itself. The immune system abnormally recognizes self-components as foreign and produces antibodies targeting normal cells and tissues. We and others have discovered a number of failures affecting autophagy pathways in the lymphocytes of model mice and patients with lupus. While the current treatments are mainly based on immunosuppressive drugs that can lead to important side effects  the synthetic phosphopeptide P140/Lupuzor  which targets chaperone-mediated autophagy and displays no side effects  holds a lot of promise as a drug candidate. P140  which is currently evaluated in a phase III clinical trial  targets chaperone-mediated autophagy that is hyperactivated in lupus mice  and reduces antigenic peptides presentation to autoreactive helper T cells. Remarkably  we showed in lupus mice that upon treatment with P140  a number of immunological abnormalities affecting the pool of T and B cells as well as many biological and clinical features no longer occur.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tetramethylpyrazine phosphate and borneol combination therapy synergistically attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injury of the hypothalamus and striatum via regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in a rat model.The combination of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and borneol (BO) has shown promise for treatment of cerebral ischemia in clinical and experimental studies. However  the mechanism for the synergistic effect of these compounds is unclear. In this study  global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (GCIR) was induced in rats that were subsequently treated with tetramethylpyrazine phosphate (TMPP) (13.3 mg/kg)  BO (0.16 g/kg)  or the combination TMPP + BO. Neuronal ultrastructure and intracellular calcium [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i levels were evaluated in hypothalamus and striatum. Neuron autophagy was evaluated by expression of LC3 II/I  ULK1  Beclin1  BNIP3  mTOR  and pAMPK. Neuron apoptosis was examined via apoptosis index (AI) and expression of p53  Bcl-2  Bax  and caspase-3. Both monotherapies significantly improved neuronal ultrastructure  reduced numbers of apoptotic neurons and AI  attenuated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i overload  increased expression of pAMPK  ULK1  and LC3 II/I  and markedly reduced expression of mTOR  p53  and caspase-3 in hypothalamus and striatum. In hypothalamus  TMPP increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression. In striatum  TMPP and BO increased Beclin1 expression while TMPP increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression. TMPP + BO combination therapy enhanced expression of LC3 II/I  pAMPK  mTOR  and ULK1 in hypothalamus  and pAMPK  mTOR  ULK1  Beclin1  and Bax in striatum compared to the monotherapies. Combination therapy synergistically modulated p53 and adjusted Bcl-2 in striatum compared to TMPP and BO monotherapies  respectively. These results demonstrated a synergistic effect of TMPP + BO in protecting against hypothalamus and striatum in rats from ischemia-reperfusion injury and suggested that the mechanism involved shifting neurons from harmful apoptosis to protective autophagy and reducing neuronal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dicot-specific ATG8-interacting ATI3 proteins interact with conserved UBAC2 proteins and play critical roles in plant stress responses.Selective macroautophagy/autophagy targets specific cargo by autophagy receptors through interaction with ATG8 (autophagy-related protein 8)/MAP1LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3) for degradation in the vacuole. Here  we report the identification and characterization of 3 related ATG8-interacting proteins (AT1G17780/ATI3A  AT2G16575/ATI3B and AT1G73130/ATI3C) from Arabidopsis. ATI3 proteins contain a WxxL LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif at the C terminus required for interaction with ATG8. ATI3 homologs are found only in dicots but not in other organisms including monocots. Disruption of ATI3A does not alter plant growth or development but compromises both plant heat tolerance and resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. The critical role of ATI3A in plant stress tolerance and disease resistance is dependent on its interaction with ATG8. Disruption of ATI3B and ATI3C also significantly compromises plant heat tolerance. ATI3A interacts with AT3G56740/UBAC2A and AT2G41160/UBAC2B (Ubiquitin-associated [UBA] protein 2a/b)  2 conserved proteins implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation. Disruption of UBAC2A and UBAC2B also compromised heat tolerance and resistance to B. cinerea. Overexpression of UBAC2 induces formation of ATG8- and ATI3-labeled punctate structures under normal conditions  likely reflecting increased formation of phagophores or autophagosomes. The ati3 and ubac2 mutants are significantly compromised in sensitivity to tunicamycin  an ER stress-inducing agent  but are fully competent in autophagy-dependent ER degradation under conditions of ER stress when using an ER lumenal marker for detection. We propose that ATI3 and UBAC2 play an important role in plant stress responses by mediating selective autophagy of specific unknown ER components.,Autophagy_notLIR
The protection role of Atg16l1 in CD11c<sup>+</sup>dendritic cells in murine colitis.The autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (Atg16l1) is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has been shown to play an essential role in paneth cell function and intestinal homeostasis. However  the functional consequences of Atg16l1 deficiency in myeloid cells  particularly in dendritic cells (DCs)  are not fully characterized. The aim of this study is to investigate the functional consequence of Atg16l1 in CD11c<sup>+</sup>DCs in murine colitis. We generated mice deficient in Atg16l1 in CD11c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) and S. typhimurium infection induced colitis was used to assess the role of DCs specific Atg16l1 deficiency in vivo in murine colitis. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were isolated and autophagy function was assessed with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β (Map1lc3b or LC3) by western blot. Uptake of Salmonella enteric serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) was assessed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular S. typhimurium killing in BMDCs were assessed. We showed worsened colonic inflammation in Atg16l1 deficiency mice in DSS induced murine colitis with increased proinflammatory cytokines of IL-1β and TNF-α. Mechanistic studies performed in primary murine BMDCs showed that Atg16l1 deficiency increased ROS production  reduced microbial killing and impaired antigen processing for altered intracellular trafficking. Together  these results indicate impaired CD11c<sup>+</sup>DCs function with Atg16l1 deficiency contributes to the severity of murine colitis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Deciphering the ionic homeostasis  oxidative stress  apoptosis  and autophagy in chicken intestine under copper(II) stress.As cofactors of several enzymatic  copper (Cu) participates in many essential metabolic processes. Also  as a heavy metal  it exhibits highly toxic to the organism if excessive. This study endeavored to detect the pathophysiological changes in the jejunum of chickens  which were insulted by CuSO<sub>4</sub> (300 mg/kg diet) for 90 days. Results showed metabolic disorders of trace elements evidenced by their significant downregulations (Na  Al  Li  B  Cr  Ni  Sn  Sb  Ba) and upregulations (Cu  Si  As  Cd  Se  and Tl) in 90 days. Simultaneously  increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei and distinct ultrastructural apoptotic features were observed. Meanwhile  in 30  60  and 90 days  indicators of oxidative stress  apoptosis  autophagy  and mitochondrial dynamic were detected to uncover the molecular mechanism behind these pathological changes. The results showed that suppressed antioxidant ability was companied by increased mRNA and protein levels of proapoptosis and mitochondrial fission activating genes in the Cu group compared with chickens in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover  the markers of autophagy long-chain 3 (LC3-II/LC3-I)  Bcl-2-interacting protein (beclin-1)  and autophagy-related gene (ATG4B and ATG5) displayed a time-dependent increase during 30  60  and 90 days. We conjectured that subchronic copper poisoning  under the background of redistribution of trace elements  induced oxidative stress and cascaded apoptosis  autophagy  and mitochondrial disorder  which contributed to jejunotoxicity in chicken. Collectively  our study provides a basic assessment of subchronic Cu exposure on poultry  voicing concerns about copper pollution by anthropogenic activities.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lipoxin A4 receptor agonist BML-111 induces autophagy in alveolar macrophages and protects from acute lung injury by activating MAPK signaling.Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening lung disease where alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a central role both in the early phase to initiate inflammatory responses and in the late phase to promote tissue repair. In this study  we examined whether BML-111  a lipoxin A4 receptor agonist  could alter the phenotypes of AM and thus present prophylactic benefits for ALI.,Autophagy_notLIR
In silico and experimental analyses predict the therapeutic value of an EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 against hepatocellular carcinoma through the induction of metallothionein genes.There are currently no effective molecular targeted therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)  a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)-specific methyltransferase  has been emerged as novel anticancer target. Our previous study has demonstrated that GSK343  an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-competitive inhibitor of EZH2  induces autophagy and enhances drug sensitivity in cancer cells including HCC. In this study  an in silico study was performed and found that EZH2 was overexpressed in cancerous tissues of HCC patients at both gene and protein levels. Microarray analysis and in vitro experiments indicated that the anti-HCC activity of GSK343 was associated with the induction of metallothionein (MT) genes. In addition  the negative association of EZH2 and MT1/MT2A genes in cancer cell lines and tissues was found in public gene expression database. Taken together  our findings suggest that EZH2 inhibitors could be a good therapeutic option for HCC  and induction of MT genes was associated with the anti-HCC activity of EZH2 inhibitors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rapamycin: A Bacteria-Derived Immunosuppressant That Has Anti-atherosclerotic Effects and Its Clinical Application.Atherosclerosis (AS) is the leading cause of stroke and death worldwide. Although many lipid-lowering or antiplatelet medicines have been used to prevent the devastating outcomes caused by AS  the serious side effects of these medicines cannot be ignored. Moreover  these medicines are aimed at preventing end-point events rather than addressing the formation and progression of the lesion. Rapamycin (sirolimus)  a fermentation product derived from soil samples  has immunosuppressive and anti-proliferation effects. It is an inhibitor of mammalian targets of rapamycin  thereby stimulating autophagy pathways. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that rapamycin possess multiple protective effects against AS through various molecular mechanisms. Moreover  it has been used successfully as an anti-proliferation agent to prevent in-stent restenosis or vascular graft stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease. A thorough understanding of the biomedical regulatory mechanism of rapamycin in AS might reveal pathways for retarding AS. This review summarizes the current knowledge of biomedical mechanisms by which rapamycin retards AS through action on various cells (endothelial cells  macrophages  vascular smooth muscle cells  and T-cells) in early and advanced AS and describes clinical and potential clinical applications of the agent.,Autophagy_notLIR

Measurement of the Activity of the Atg4 Cysteine Proteases.While only one Atg4 is present in yeast  there are four Atg4 homologues in human and in mouse with different substrate specificities and catalytic efficiencies. The molecule Atg4 is a type of cysteine protease  and is known for its crucial roles in cleavage of the Atg8 family proteins before they can be conjugated to phospholipids  and also in cleavage of the conjugated Atg8 molecules from the membrane  a process known as deconjugation. Both processes are required for the maximal efficiency in autophagosome biogenesis. Atg4 could thus be a target for intervention of the autophagy process. It is thus important to measure Atg4 activity to determine and to modulate the autophagy function. Here  we review the catalytic functions and regulatory mechanisms of human Atg4 proteases and discuss the methodology for analyzing Atg4 activity in details.,Autophagy_notLIR
Combination of the novel histone deacetylase inhibitor YCW1 and radiation induces autophagic cell death through the downregulation of BNIP3 in triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and invasive of the breast cancer subtypes. TNBC is a challenging disease that lacks targets for treatment. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a group of targeted anticancer agents that enhance radiosensitivity. Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is a member of the Bcl-2 subfamily. BNIP3 is not found in normal breast tissue but is up-regulated in breast cancer. In the present study  we investigated the anti-cancer effects of a newly developed HDACi  YCW1  combined with ionizing radiation (IR) in TNBC in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model. Furthermore  we examined the relationship between autophagy and BNIP3.,Autophagy_notLIR
Arsenic trioxide promoting ETosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia through mTOR-regulated autophagy.Despite the high efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and eradicating APL leukemia-initiating cells (LICs)  the mechanism underlying its selective cytotoxicity remains elusive. We have recently demonstrated that APL cells undergo a novel cell death program  termed ETosis  through autophagy. However  the role of ETosis in ATO-induced APL LIC eradication remains unclear. For this study  we evaluated the effects of ATO on ETosis and the contributions of drug-induced ETosis to APL LIC eradication. In NB4 cells  ATO primarily increased ETosis at moderate concentrations (0.5-0.75 μM) and stimulated apoptosis at higher doses (1.0-2.0 μM). Furthermore  ATO induced ETosis through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy  which was partially regulated by reactive oxygen species. Additionally  rapamycin-enhanced ATO-induced ETosis in NB4 cells and APL cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. In contrast  rapamycin had no effect on apoptosis in these cells. We also noted that PML/RARA oncoprotein was effectively cleared with this combination. Intriguingly  activation of autophagy with rapamycin-enhanced APL LIC eradication clearance by ATO in vitro and in a xenograft APL model  while inhibition of autophagy spared clonogenic cells. Our current results show that ATO exerts antileukemic effects at least partially through ETosis and targets LICs primarily through ETosis. Addition of drugs that target the ETotic pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to further eradicate LICs and reduce relapse.,Autophagy_notLIR
The fine tuning of metabolism  autophagy and differentiation during in vitro myogenesis.Although the mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle homeostasis have been identified  there is a lack of knowledge of the integrated dynamic processes occurring during myogenesis and their regulation. Here  metabolism  autophagy and differentiation were concomitantly analyzed in mouse muscle satellite cell (MSC)-derived myoblasts and their cross-talk addressed by drug and genetic manipulation. We show that increased mitochondrial biogenesis and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inactivation-independent basal autophagy characterize the conversion of myoblasts into myotubes. Notably  inhibition of autophagic flux halts cell fusion in the latest stages of differentiation and  conversely  when the fusion step of myocytes is impaired the biogenesis of autophagosomes is also impaired. By using myoblasts derived from p53 null mice  we show that in the absence of p53 glycolysis prevails and mitochondrial biogenesis is strongly impaired. P53 null myoblasts show defective terminal differentiation and attenuated basal autophagy when switched into differentiating culture conditions. In conclusion  we demonstrate that basal autophagy contributes to a correct execution of myogenesis and that physiological p53 activity is required for muscle homeostasis by regulating metabolism and by affecting autophagy and differentiation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Obatoclax kills anaplastic thyroid cancer cells by inducing lysosome neutralization and necrosis.Poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are very aggressive  almost invariably lethal neoplasms for which no effective treatment exists. These tumors are intrinsically resistant to cell death  even when their driver oncogenic signaling pathways are inhibited.We have undertaken a detailed analysis  in mouse and human thyroid cancer cells  of the mechanism through which Obatoclax  a pan-inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family  effectively reduces tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.We demonstrate that Obatoclax does not induce apoptosis  but rather necrosis of thyroid cancer cells  and that non-transformed thyroid cells are significantly less affected by this compound. Surprisingly  we show that Obatoclax rapidly localizes to the lysosomes and induces loss of acidification  block of lysosomal fusion with autophagic vacuoles  and subsequent lysosomal permeabilization. Notably  prior lysosome neutralization using different V-ATPase inhibitors partially protects cancer cells from the toxic effects of Obatoclax. Although inhibition of autophagy does not affect Obatoclax-induced cell death  selective down-regulation of ATG7  but not of ATG5  partially impairs Obatoclax effects  suggesting the existence of autophagy-independent functions for ATG7. Strikingly  Obatoclax killing activity depends only on its accumulation in the lysosomes  and not on its interaction with BCL2 family members.Finally  we show that also other lysosome-targeting compounds  Mefloquine and LLOMe  readily induce necrosis in thyroid cancer cells  and that Mefloquine significantly impairs tumor growth in vivo  highlighting a clear vulnerability of these aggressive  apoptosis-resistant tumors that can be therapeutically exploited.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tangeretin derivative  5-acetyloxy-6 7 8 4'-tetramethoxyflavone induces G2/M arrest  apoptosis and autophagy in human non-small cell lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.Tangeretin  a major phytochemicals in tangerine peels--an important Chinese herb  has been found to have anti-carcinogenic properties. To improve bioavailability and increase potency of tangeretin  its derivative  5-acetyloxy-6 7 8 4'-tetramethoxyflavone (5-AcTMF)  has been synthesized and shown potent inhibition of proliferation activity against human breast and leukemia cancer cell lines. In this study  we have further investigated the anticancer effects of 5-AcTMF on CL1-5 non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that 5-AcTMF effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation  induced G2/M-phase arrest associated with cdc2 and CDC25c and increased in the apoptotic cells associated with caspase activation  down regulation of Bcl-2  XIAP and Survivn  inducing release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also found that 5-AcTMF treatment of CL1-5 activated autophagy  indicated by triggered autophagosome formation and increased LC3-II levels and formation of LC3 puncta. Moreover  we also found that 5-AcTMF lowered phophoatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Over-expression of AKT by AKT cDNA transfection decreased 5-AcTMF mediated apoptosis and autophagy  supporting the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by inhibition of AKT pathway. In an animal study  5-AcTMF effectively delayed tumor growth in a nude mouse model of CL1-5 xenografts without observed adverse effect. Immunohistochemistry Analysis indicated that 5-AcTMF induced CL1-5 cell apoptosis and autophagy in vivo. Taken together  these data demonstrate that 5-AcTMF is a novel small molecule agent that can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation  and induce G(2)/M phase arrest and via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
NOD-2 and TLR-4 Signaling Reinforces the Efficacy of Dendritic Cells and Reduces the Dose of TB Drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading killer infectious diseases. TB patients are inflicted with devastating side effects and the toxicity of a lengthy drug regime  accentuating an urgent need to explore newer and safer treatment methods. Recently  an improved understanding of host-pathogen interaction has opened new avenues for TB treatment  including immunotherapy. This has emboldened us to devise a novel strategy to restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) growth by activating dendritic cells (DCs) through the NOD-2 and TLR-4 molecules of innate immunity. Triggered DCs show a robust release of cytokines and nitric oxide  autophagy and improved migration towards the lymph nodes  and consequently impede the intracellular survival of Mtb. Of note  this approach enhanced the efficacy of TB drugs by reducing their dose to a 5-fold lesser concentration than recommended. In vivo administration of ligands of NOD-2 (NOD-2L) and TLR-4 (TLR-4L) substantially increased the pool of effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Additionally  NOD-2L and TLR-4L  in conjunction with the reduced dose of isoniazid  substantially declined the Mtb burden in the lungs. In the future  adjunct therapy involving NOD-2L  TLR-4L and TB drugs may have enough potential to reduce the dose and duration of treatment of TB patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inside job: Staphylococcus aureus host-pathogen interactions.Staphylococcus aureus is a notorious opportunistic pathogen causing a plethora of diseases. Recent research established that once phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages  a certain percentage of S. aureus is able to survive within these phagocytes which thereby even may contribute to dissemination of the pathogen. S. aureus further induces its uptake by otherwise non-phagocytic cells and the ensuing intracellular cytotoxicity is suggested to lead to tissue destruction  whereas bacterial persistence within cells is thought to lead to immune evasion and chronicity of infections. We here review recent work on the S. aureus host pathogen interactions with a focus on the intracellular survival of the pathogen.,Autophagy_notLIR
GPx1 is involved in the induction of protective autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells in response to glucose deprivation.Given the dense stroma and poor vascularization  access to nutrients is limited in the microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). PDA cells can efficiently recycle various metabolic substrates through the activation of different rescuing pathways  including the autophagy pathway. However  the precise roles of autophagy in cancer metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the present study  we first monitored the effect of glucose deprivation on autophagy and on the expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) in PDA cells under the glucose-free environment. Glucose starvation induced progressive autophagy activation in PDA cells via the activation of ROS/AMPK signaling. GPx1 degradation caused by glucose deprivation led to further ROS-dependent autophagy activation. Both GPx1 overexpression and autophagy inhibition sensitized cells to starvation-induced cell death through the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover  GPx1 may regulate glycolysis inhibition in PDA cells under glucose-deprived conditions. In summary  this study increases our understanding of the role of GPx1 in the induction of protective autophagy in PDA cells under extreme glucose starvation and may provide new therapeutic targets or innovative therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bacopa monnieri-Induced Protective Autophagy Inhibits Benzo[a]pyrene-Mediated Apoptosis.Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is capable of inducing oxidative stress and cellular injuries leading to cell death and associates with a significant risk of cancer development. Prevention of B[a]P-induced cellular toxicity with herbal compound through regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress might protect cell death and have therapeutic benefit to human health. In this study  we demonstrated the cytoprotective role of Bacopa monnieri (BM) against B[a]P-induced apoptosis through autophagy induction. Pretreatment with BM rescued the reduction in cell viability in B[a]P-treated human keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells indicating the cytoprotective potential of BM against B[a]P. Moreover  BM was found to inhibit B[a]P-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis activation in HaCaT cells. Furthermore  BM was found to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited release of cytochrome c in B[a]P-treated HaCaT cells. Bacopa monnieri induced protective autophagy; we knocked down Beclin-1  and data showed that BM was unable to protect from B[a]P-induced mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis in Beclin-1-deficient HaCaT cells. Moreover  we established that B[a]P-induced damaged mitochondria were found to colocalize and degraded within autolysosomes in order to protect HaCaT cells from mitochondrial injury. In conclusion  B[a]P-induced apoptosis was rescued by BM treatment and provided cytoprotection through Beclin-1-dependent autophagy activation.

Nutrient-regulated Phosphorylation of ATG13 Inhibits Starvation-induced Autophagy.Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that utilizes a defined series of membrane trafficking events to generate a de novo double-membrane vesicle termed the autophagosome  which matures by fusing to the lysosome. Subsequently  the lysosome facilitates the degradation and recycling of the cytoplasmic cargo. In yeast  the upstream signals that regulate the induction of starvation-induced autophagy are clearly defined. The nutrient-sensing kinase Tor inhibits the activation of autophagy by regulating the formation of the Atg1-Atg13-Atg17 complex  through hyperphosphorylation of Atg13. However  in mammals  the ortholog complex ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 is constitutively formed. As such  the molecular mechanism by which mTOR regulates mammalian autophagy is unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of novel nutrient-regulated phosphorylation sites on ATG13: Ser-224 and Ser-258. mTOR directly phosphorylates ATG13 on Ser-258 while Ser-224 is modulated by the AMPK pathway. In ATG13 knock-out cells reconstituted with an unphosphorylatable mutant of ATG13  ULK1 kinase activity is more potent  and amino acid starvation induced more rapid ATG13 and ULK1 translocation. These events culminated in a more rapid starvation-induced autophagy response. Therefore  ATG13 phosphorylation plays a crucial role in autophagy regulation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Assessing Autophagy in Sciatic Nerves of a Rat Model that Develops Inflammatory Autoimmune Peripheral Neuropathies.The rat sciatic nerve has attracted widespread attention as an excellent model system for studying autophagy alterations in peripheral neuropathies. In our laboratory  we have developed an original rat model  which we used currently in routine novel drug screening and to evaluate treatment strategies for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and other closely related diseases. Lewis rats injected with the S-palmitoylated P0(180-199) peptide develop a chronic  sometimes relapsing-remitting type of disease. Our model fulfills electrophysiological criteria of demyelination with axonal degeneration  confirmed by immunohistopathology and several typical features of CIDP. We have set up a series of techniques that led us to examine the failures of autophagy pathways in the sciatic nerve of these model rats and to follow the possible improvement of these defects after treatment. Based on these newly introduced methods  a novel area of investigation is now open and will allow us to more thoroughly examine important features of certain autophagy pathways occurring in sciatic nerves.,Autophagy_notLIR
PtdIns3P controls mTORC1 signaling through lysosomal positioning.The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinase complex that localizes to lysosomes to up-regulate anabolic processes and down-regulate autophagy. Although mTORC1 is known to be activated by lysosome positioning and by amino acid-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by the lipid kinase VPS34/PIK3C3  the mechanisms have been elusive. Here we present results that connect these seemingly unrelated pathways for mTORC1 activation. Amino acids stimulate recruitment of the PtdIns3P-binding protein FYCO1 to lysosomes and promote contacts between FYCO1 lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum that contain the PtdIns3P effector Protrudin. Upon overexpression of Protrudin and FYCO1  mTORC1-positive lysosomes translocate to the cell periphery  thereby facilitating mTORC1 activation. This requires the ability of Protrudin to bind PtdIns3P. Conversely  upon VPS34 inhibition  or depletion of Protrudin or FYCO1  mTORC1-positive lysosomes cluster perinuclearly  accompanied by reduced mTORC1 activity under nutrient-rich conditions. Consequently  the transcription factor EB enters the nucleus  and autophagy is up-regulated. We conclude that PtdIns3P-dependent lysosome translocation to the cell periphery promotes mTORC1 activation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of renal profibrotic TGFβ controlled signaling cascades by calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors.The calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus represent potent immunosuppressive agents frequently used for solid organ transplantation and treatment of autoimmune disorders. Despite of their immense therapeutic benefits  residual fibrosis mainly in the kidney represents a common side effect of long-term therapy with CNI. Regardless of the immunosuppressive action  an increasing body of evidence implicates that a drug-induced increase in TGFβ and subsequent activation of TGFβ-initiated signaling pathways is closely associated with the development and progression of CNI-induced nephropathy. Mechanistically  an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to drug-induced changes in the intracellular redox homeostasis functions as an important trigger of the profibrotic signaling cascades activated under therapy with CNI. Although  inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase have firmly been established as alternative compounds with a lower nephrotoxic potential  an activation of fibrogenic signaling cascades has been reported for these drugs as well. This review will comprehensively summarize recent advances in the understanding of profibrotic signaling events modulated by these widely used compounds with a specific focus put on mechanisms occurring independent of their respective immunosuppressive action. Herein  the impact of redox modulation  the activation of canonical TGFβ and non-Smad pathways and modulation of autophagy by both classes of immunosuppressive drugs will be highlighted and discussed in a broader perspective. The comprehensive knowledge of profibrotic signaling events specifically accompanying the immunomodulatory activity of these widely used drugs is needed for a reliable benefit-risk assessment under therapeutic regimens.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Ccl1-Kin28 kinase complex regulates autophagy under nitrogen starvation.Starvation triggers global alterations in the synthesis and turnover of proteins. Under such conditions  the recycling of essential nutrients by using autophagy is indispensable for survival. By screening known kinases in the yeast genome  we newly identified a regulator of autophagy  the Ccl1-Kin28 kinase complex (the equivalent of the mammalian cyclin-H-Cdk7 complex)  which is known to play key roles in RNA-polymerase-II-mediated transcription. We show that inactivation of Ccl1 caused complete block of autophagy. Interestingly  Ccl1 itself was subject to proteasomal degradation  limiting the level of autophagy during prolonged starvation. We present further evidence that the Ccl1-Kin28 complex regulates the expression of Atg29 and Atg31  which is crucial in the assembly of the Atg1 kinase complex. The identification of this previously unknown regulatory pathway sheds new light on the complex signaling network that governs autophagy activity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Methamphetamine increases Prion Protein and induces dopamine-dependent expression of protease resistant PrPsc.The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is physiologically expressed within selective brain areas of mammals. Alterations in the secondary structure of this protein lead to scrapie-like prion protein (PrPsc)  which precipitates in the cell. PrPsc has been detected in infectious  inherited or sporadic neurodegenerative disorders. Prion protein metabolism is dependent on autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome. Despite not being fully elucidated  the physiological role of prion protein relates to chaperones which rescue cells under stressful conditions.Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused drug which produces oxidative stress in various brain areas causing mitochondrial alterations and protein misfolding. These effects produce a compensatory increase of chaperones while clogging cell clearing pathways. In the present study  we explored whether METH administration modifies the amount of PrPc. Since high levels of PrPc when the clearing systems are clogged may lead to its misfolding into PrPsc  we further tested whether METH exposure triggers the appearance of PrPsc. We analysed the effects of METH and dopamine administration in PC12 and striatal cells by using SDS-PAGE Coomassie blue  immune- histochemistry and immune-gold electron microscopy. To analyze whether METH administration produces PrPsc aggregates we used antibodies directed against PrP following exposure to proteinase K or sarkosyl which digest folded PrPc but misfolded PrPsc. We fond that METH triggers PrPsc aggregates in DA-containing cells while METH is not effective in primary striatal neurons which do not produce DA. In the latter cells exogenous DA is needed to trigger PrPsc accumulation similarly to what happens in DA containing cells under the effects of METH. The present findings  while fostering novel molecular mechanisms involving prion proteins  indicate that  cell pathology similar to prion disorders can be mimicked via a DA-dependent mechanism by a drug of abuse.,Autophagy_notLIR
Investigation of key autophagy-and mitophagy-related proteins and gene expression in BALF cells from patients with IPF and RA-ILD.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and irreversible interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Over the past decade  research efforts have focused on the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in this enigmatic lung disease. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease often complicated by the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD)  leading to high mortality and morbidity. Autophagy is a process regulating the turnover of subcellular components and organelles  and represents a major cellular homeostatic mechanism. Recent evidence suggests a role of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of IPF  focusing on lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to examine the mRNA levels of molecules involved inthe autophagy pathway in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)‑derived cellsfrom patients with IPF in comparison topatients with RA demonstrating lung involvement (ILD) by RT-qPCR. The significant upregulation of BECLIN1 was observed in patients with RA-ILD compared with those with IPF. Other genes involved in the autophagy pathway were also examined  such as Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1)  BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and p62. No differences in the mRNA expression levels of these genes were observed. As regards the selective degradation of mitochondria and mitophagy  similar PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARKIN; E3 ubiquitin ligase (PRKN) expression  as well as PINK1 protein levels  were observed. On the whole  the findings of this study demonstrate an increased expression of BECLIN1 in BALF cells from patients with RA-ILD compared with those from patients with IPF  while similar levels in other key molecules implicating in the autophagy pathway were observed in patients with IPF and RA-ILD.,Autophagy_notLIR
MIR376 family and cancer.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They have been implicated in several fundamental biological processes including development  differentiation  apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs also play roles in cellular transformation and carcinogenesis by acting either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Recent studies introduced MIR376 as an important microRNA family for cancer formation and progression. The MIR376 family is located on human chromosome 14 and it has several members containing identical or similar seed sequences. Biological roles of family members were studied in different cancer settings  including gliomas  leukemia  breast and ovarian cancers. Furthermore  two MIR376 family members  namely MIR376A and MIR376B were implicated in the regulation of macroautophagy (autophagy herein). Since autophagy dysregulation underlies various diseases including cancer  it is essential to understand the role of the MIR376 family in this context. In this article  we summarize the miRNA-cancer connection  and review accumulating data about the involvement of the MIR376 family in cancer biology.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ketoconazole exacerbates mitophagy to induce apoptosis by downregulating cyclooxygenase-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and remains a major clinical challenge. Ketoconazole  a traditional antifungal agent  has attracted considerable attention as a therapeutic option for cancer treatment. However  its mechanism of action is still not clearly defined. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ketoconazole on HCC and investigate the underlying mechanisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) describe a heterogeneous group of rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from the absence or loss of function of lysosomal hydrolases or transporters  resulting in the progressive accumulation of undigested material in lysosomes. The accumulation of substances affects the function of lysosomes and other organelles  resulting in secondary alterations such as impairment of autophagy  mitochondrial dysfunction  inflammation and apoptosis. LSDs frequently involve the central nervous system (CNS)  where neuronal dysfunction or loss results in progressive neurodegeneration and premature death. Many LSDs exhibit signs of mitochondrial dysfunction  which include mitochondrial morphological changes  decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)  diminished ATP production and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore  reduced autophagic flux may lead to the persistence of dysfunctional mitochondria. Gaucher disease (GD)  the LSD with the highest prevalence  is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene that results in defective and insufficient activity of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Decreased catalytic activity and/or instability of GCase leads to accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) in the lysosomes of macrophage cells and visceral organs. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported to occur in numerous cellular and mouse models of GD. The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge and implications of mitochondrial dysfunction in LSDs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Increased Autophagy-Related 5 Gene Expression Is Associated with Collagen Expression in the Airways of Refractory Asthmatics.Fibrosis  particularly excessive collagen deposition  presents a challenge for treating asthmatic individuals. At present  no drugs can remove or reduce excessive collagen in asthmatic airways. Hence  the identification of pathways involved in collagen deposition would help to generate therapeutic targets to interfere with the airway remodeling process. Autophagy  a cellular degradation process  has been shown to be dysregulated in various fibrotic diseases  and genetic association studies in independent human populations have identified autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) to be associated with asthma pathogenesis. Hence  the dysregulation of autophagy may contribute to fibrosis in asthmatic airways.,Autophagy_notLIR
PM2.5 induces autophagy-mediated cell death via NOS2 signaling in human bronchial epithelium cells.The biggest victim of ambient air pollution is the respiratory system. Mainly because of the harmful components  especially the particulate matters with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5µm (PM2.5)  can be directly inhaled and deeply penetrate into the lung alveoli  thus causing severe lung dysfunction  including chronic cough  bronchitis and asthma  even lung cancer. Unfortunately  the toxicological mechanisms of PM2.5 associations with these adverse respiratory outcomes have still not been clearly unveiled. Here  we found that PM2.5 rapidly induced inflammatory responses  oxidative injure and cell death in human bronchial epithelium cells through upregulation of IL-6 expression  ROS production and apoptosis. Furthermore  PM2.5 specifically induced nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression and NO generation to elevate excessive autophagy. Finally  disruption of NOS2 signaling effectively blocked autophayosome formation and the subsequent cell death. Our novel findings systemically reveled the role of autophagy-mediated cell death in PM2.5-treated human bronchial epithelium cells and provided potential strategy for future clinic intervention.,Autophagy_notLIR
A lysosome-plasma membrane-sphingolipid axis linking lysosomal storage to cell growth arrest.Lysosomal accumulation of undegraded materials is a common feature of lysosomal storage diseases  neurodegenerative disorders  and the aging process. To better understand the role of lysosomal storage in the onset of cell damage  we used human fibroblasts loaded with sucrose as a model of lysosomal accumulation. Sucrose-loaded fibroblasts displayed increased lysosomal biogenesis followed by arrested cell proliferation. Notably  we found that reduced lysosomal catabolism and autophagy impairment led to an increase in sphingolipids ( i.e.  sphingomyelin  glucosylceramide  ceramide  and the gangliosides GM3 and GD3)  at both intracellular and plasma membrane (PM) levels. In addition  we observed an increase in the lysosomal membrane protein Lamp-1 on the PM of sucrose-loaded fibroblasts and a greater release of the soluble lysosomal protein cathepsin D in their extracellular medium compared with controls. These results indicate increased fusion between lysosomes and the PM  as also suggested by the increased activity of lysosomal glycosphingolipid hydrolases on the PM of sucrose-loaded fibroblasts. The inhibition of β-glucocerebrosidase and nonlysosomal glucosylceramidase  both involved in ceramide production resulting from glycosphingolipid catabolism on the PM  partially restored cell proliferation. Our findings indicate the existence of a new molecular mechanism underlying cell damage triggered by lysosomal impairment.-Samarani  M.  Loberto  N.  Soldà  G.  Straniero  L.  Asselta  R.  Duga  S.

Fasting-induced hormonal regulation of lysosomal function.Lysosomes are centers for nutrient sensing and recycling that allow mammals to adapt to starvation. Regulation of lysosome dynamics by internal nutrient signaling is well described  but the mechanisms by which external cues modulate lysosomal function are unclear. Here  we describe an essential role of the fasting-induced hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in lysosome homeostasis in mice. Fgf21 deficiency impairs hepatic lysosomal function by blocking transcription factor EB (TFEB)  a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. FGF21 induces mobilization of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum  which activates the transcriptional repressor downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM)  and thereby inhibits expression of Mid1 (encoding the E3 ligase Midline-1). Protein phosphatase PP2A  a substrate of MID1  accumulates and dephosphorylates TFEB  thereby upregulating genes involved in lysosome biogenesis  autophagy and lipid metabolism. Thus  an FGF21-TFEB signaling axis links lysosome homeostasis with extracellular hormonal signaling to orchestrate lipid metabolism during fasting.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autophagy-dependent danger signaling and adaptive immunity to poorly immunogenic tumors.Recent data suggest that autophagy does not influence spontaneous and therapy-elicited tumor infiltration by immune cells in murine models of melanoma and breast carcinoma. These findings  which have been obtained in the absence of a therapeutically relevant anticancer immune response  indicate that the intrinsically low immunogenicity of some tumors cannot be compensated for by increased danger signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hemin induces mitophagy in a leukemic erythroblast cell line.In eukaryotic cells  autophagy is considered a lysosomal catabolic process which participates in the degradation of intracellular components in a vacuolar structure termed autolysosome. This pathway plays a significant role in the erythropoiesis process  contributing to the clearance of some organelles (such as mitochondria) that are not necessary in the mature red blood cells. Nevertheless  the role of autophagy in erythrocyte maturation has not been fully established.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial respiration links TOR complex 2 signaling to calcium regulation and autophagy.The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a conserved regulator of cell growth and functions within 2 different protein complexes  TORC1 and TORC2  where TORC2 positively controls macroautophagy/autophagy during amino acid starvation. Under these conditions  TORC2 signaling inhibits the activity of the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin and promotes the general amino acid control (GAAC) response and autophagy. Here we demonstrate that TORC2 regulates calcineurin by controlling the respiratory activity of mitochondria. In particular  we find that mitochondrial oxidative stress affects the calcium channel regulatory protein Mid1  which we show is an essential upstream activator of calcineurin. Thus  these findings describe a novel regulation for autophagy that involves TORC2 signaling  mitochondrial respiration  and calcium homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sarcosine Is Uniquely Modulated by Aging and Dietary Restriction in Rodents and Humans.A hallmark of aging is a decline in metabolic homeostasis  which is attenuated by dietary restriction (DR). However  the interaction of aging and DR with the metabolome is not well understood. We report that DR is a stronger modulator of the rat metabolome than age in plasma and tissues. A comparative metabolomic screen in rodents and humans identified circulating sarcosine as being similarly reduced with aging and increased by DR  while sarcosine is also elevated in long-lived Ames dwarf mice. Pathway analysis in aged sarcosine-replete rats identify this biogenic amine as an integral node in the metabolome network. Finally  we show that sarcosine can activate autophagy in cultured cells and enhances autophagic flux in vivo  suggesting a potential role in autophagy induction by DR. Thus  these data identify circulating sarcosine as a biomarker of aging and DR in mammalians and may contribute to age-related alterations in the metabolome and in proteostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
KRAS Mutant Pancreatic Cancer: No Lone Path to an Effective Treatment.Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with a dismal 7% 5-year survival rate and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2020. KRAS is mutated in 95% of PDACs and is a well-validated driver of PDAC growth and maintenance. However  despite comprehensive efforts  an effective anti-RAS drug has yet to reach the clinic. Different paths to inhibiting RAS signaling are currently under investigation in the hope of finding a successful treatment. Recently  direct RAS binding molecules have been discovered  challenging the perception that RAS is an "undruggable" protein. Other strategies currently being pursued take an indirect approach  targeting proteins that facilitate RAS membrane association or downstream effector signaling. Unbiased genetic screens have identified synthetic lethal interactors of mutant RAS. Most recently  metabolic targets in pathways related to glycolytic signaling  glutamine utilization  autophagy  and macropinocytosis are also being explored. Harnessing the patient's immune system to fight their cancer is an additional exciting route that is being considered. The "best" path to inhibiting KRAS has yet to be determined  with each having promise as well as potential pitfalls. We will summarize the state-of-the-art for each direction  focusing on efforts directed toward the development of therapeutics for pancreatic cancer patients with mutated KRAS.,Autophagy_notLIR

Lactoferricin Peptides Increase Macrophages' Capacity To Kill <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>.Mycobacterial infections cause a significant burden of disease and death worldwide. Their treatment is long  toxic  costly  and increasingly prone to failure due to bacterial resistance to currently available antibiotics. New therapeutic options are thus clearly needed. Antimicrobial peptides represent an important source of new antimicrobial molecules  both for their direct activity and for their immunomodulatory potential. We have previously reported that a short version of the bovine antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin with amino acids 17 to 30 (LFcin17-30)  along with its variants obtained by specific amino acid substitutions  killed <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> in broth culture. In the present work  those peptides were tested against <i>M. avium</i> living inside its natural host cell  the macrophage. We found that the peptides increased the antimicrobial action of the conventional antibiotic ethambutol inside macrophages. Moreover  the d-enantiomer of the lactoferricin peptide (d-LFcin17-30) was more stable and induced significant killing of intracellular mycobacteria by itself. Interestingly  d-LFcin17-30 did not localize to <i>M. avium</i>-harboring phagosomes but induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the formation of lysosomes and autophagosome-like vesicles. These results lead us to conclude that d-LFcin17-30 primes macrophages for intracellular microbial digestion through phagosomal maturation and/or autophagy  culminating in mycobacterial killing. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> comprises several pathogenic species  including <i>M. tuberculosis</i>  <i>M. leprae</i>  <i>M. avium</i>  etc. Infections caused by these bacteria are particularly difficult to treat due to their intrinsic impermeability  low growth rate  and intracellular localization. Antimicrobial peptides are increasingly acknowledged as potential treatment tools  as they have a high spectrum of activity  low tendency to induce bacterial resistance  and immunomodulatory properties. In this study  we show that peptides derived from bovine lactoferricin (LFcin) improve the antimicrobial activity of ethambutol against <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> growing inside macrophages. Moreover  the d-enantiomer of a short version of lactoferricin containing amino acids 17 to 30 (d-LFcin17-30) causes intramacrophagic death of <i>M. avium</i> by increasing the formation of lysosomes and autophagosomes. This work opens the way to the use of lactoferricin-derived peptides to treat infections caused by mycobacteria and highlights important modulatory effects of d-FLcin17-30 on macrophages  which may be useful under other conditions in which macrophage activation is needed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ferroptosis  a Recent Defined Form of Critical Cell Death in Neurological Disorders.Ferroptosis is a recently defined form of cell death with the involvement of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS)  which is distinct from apoptosis  autophagy and other forms of cell death. Emerging evidence suggested that iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation can be discovered in various neurological diseases  accompanied with reduction of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). In addition  ferroptotic inhibitors have been shown to protect neurons  and recover the cognitive function in disease animal models. This review summarizes the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and reviews the contributions of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease)  traumatic brain injury  as well as hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke  to provide the current understanding of this novel form of cell death in neurological disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Vaspin alleviates myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury via activating autophagic flux and restoring lysosomal function.Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin)  as a secretory adipokine  was reported to exert a protective role on insulin resistance. Recent studies showed that serum vaspin level was downregulated in patients with coronary artery disease. However  whether vaspin exerted specific effects on myocardial injury remains unknown. In this study  we determined to explore the role of vaspin overexpression in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that the systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus-vaspin to mice reduced myocardial infarct size and apoptosis  and improved cardiac function after reperfusion  accompanied with upregulated autophagic flux and restored lysosomal function in the ischaemic heart. Blockage of the autophagic flux with choroquine mitigated the protection of vaspin on myocardial I/R injury. Moreover  we testified that administration of exogenous recombinant human vaspin on cultured cardiomyocytes suppressed hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis  through the AMPK-mTOR-upregulated autophagic flux. Overall  we verified that vaspin functions as an adipokine which can alleviate I/R injury in the heart by suppressing myocardial apoptosis through AMPK-mTOR-dependent activation of autophagic flux  and then provided a potential breakthrough in the treatment of myocardial I/R injury and other ischaemic diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Atg8 lipidation is coordinated in a PtdIns3P-dependent manner by the PROPPIN Atg21.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8 coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine is a key component of autophagosome biogenesis. Atg21 binds via 2 sites at the circumference of its β-propeller to PtdIns3P at the phagophore assembly site (PAS). It recruits and arranges both Atg8 and Atg16  which is part of the E3-like ligase complex Atg12-Atg5-Atg16. Binding of Atg8 to Atg21 requires the FK-motif within the N-terminal-helical domain of Atg8 and D146 at the top of the Atg21 β-propeller. Atg16 binds via D101 and E102 within its coiled-coil domain to Atg21.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sigma 2 receptor expression levels in blood and bladder from healthy and bladder cancer cattle.The expression of sigma-2 receptor (S2R) was assayed in blood and bladder samples from healthy cattle and in blood and bladder of cattle with deltapapillomavirus-associated urothelial tumors. Samples of bladder from cattle with neoplasia had significantly higher S2R than samples of bladder from healthy cattle (95% CI 0.31-0.82  P < 0.05). In addition  significantly higher S2R was detected in the blood of cattle with bladder cancer than blood from healthy cattle (95% CI 0.22-0.41  P < 0.05). The results provide evidence that increased expression of SR2 in blood could be useful as circulating biomarker for bladder cancer in cattle. PGRMC1 protein levels were also found to be increased in blood and bladder from cattle with cancer and increased expression of PGRMC1 transcripts was detected by quantitative real time PCR in samples from cattle neoplasia. Furthermore  electron microscopy revealed phagophores and numerous autophagosomes  ultrastructural hallmark of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

The iron chelator deferasirox synergises with chemotherapy to treat triple-negative breast cancers.To ensure their high proliferation rate  tumor cells have an iron metabolic disorder causing them to have increased iron needs  making them more susceptible to iron deprivation. This vulnerability could be a therapeutic target. In breast cancers  the development of new therapeutic approaches is urgently needed for patients with triple-negative tumors  which frequently relapse after chemotherapy and suffer from a lack of targeted therapies. In this study  we demonstrated that deferasirox (DFX) synergises with standard chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin  cisplatin and carboplatin to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis and autophagy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Moreover  the combination of DFX with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide delayed recurrences in breast cancer patient-derived xenografts without increasing the side-effects of chemotherapies alone or altering the global iron storage of mice. Antitumor synergy of DFX and doxorubicin seems to involve downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways. Iron deprivation in combination with chemotherapy could thus help to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in TNBC patients without increasing toxicity.

Trifloxystrobin-induced mitophagy through mitochondrial damage in human skin keratinocytes.Trifloxystrobin is a strobilurin class fungicide  the mode of action of which is to block the mitochondrial electron transport chain and inhibit energy production in fungi. Although adverse effects have been reported by occupational or environmental exposure of fungicides  the pathophysiological mechanism in human cells remains poorly understood. In the present study  we investigated the impact of trifloxystrobin on exposed skin at the cellular organelle level using HaCaT  the human skin keratinocyte cell line. Cells were treated with trifloxystrobin for 48 hr and trifloxystrobin showed detrimental effects on mitochondria evidenced by altered mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology. To identify autophagic degradation of the damaged mitochondria  confocal imaging and Western blotting were performed. Trifloxystrobin induced autophagy-related proteins in HaCaT cells. The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenger mitoTEMPO was applied to further explore the mechanism of trifloxystrobin-mediated mitophagy in human skin cells. PINK1 and Parkin were overexpressed by trifloxystrobin  and mitoTEMPO alleviated the effects on mitophagy induction. Taken together  our findings indicated that mitochondrial damage and mitophagy may play a role in trifloxystrobin-induced toxicity in human keratinocytes and this could be suggested as a mechanism of cutaneous diseases developed by exposure.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bending Lipid Bilayers: A Closed-Form Collective Variable for Effective Free-Energy Landscapes in Quantitative Biology.Curvature-related processes are of major importance during protein-membrane interactions. The illusive simplicity of membrane reshaping masks a complex molecular process crucial for a wide range of biological functions like fusion  endo- and exocytosis  cell division  cytokinesis  and autophagy. To date  no functional expression of a reaction coordinate capable of biasing molecular dynamics simulations to produce membrane curvature has been reported. This represents a major drawback given that the adequate identification of proper collective variables to enhance sampling is fundamental for restrained dynamics techniques. In this work  we present a closed-form equation of a collective variable that induces bending in lipid bilayers in a controlled manner  allowing for straightforward calculation of free energy landscapes of important curvature-related events  using standard methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics. As a direct application of the collective variable  we calculate the bending free energies of a ternary lipid bilayer in the presence and the absence of a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix (N-BAR)  a well-known peripheral membrane protein that induces curvature.,Autophagy_notLIR

Neuroprotective Effect of Melatonin Against PCBs Induced Behavioural  Molecular and Histological Changes in Cerebral Cortex of Adult Male Wistar Rats.There is ample evidence stating Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as neurotoxins. In the current study  we have analyzed the behavioural impact of PCBs exposure in adult rats and assessed the simultaneous effect of antioxidant melatonin against the PCBs action. The rats were grouped into four and treated intraperitoneally with vehicle  PCBs  PCBs + melatonin and melatonin alone for 30 days  respectively. After the treatment period the rats were tested for locomotor activity and anxiety behaviour analysis. We confirmed the neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex by molecular and histological analysis. Our data indicates that there is impairment in locomotor activity and behaviour of PCBs treated rats compared to control. The simultaneous melatonin treated rat shows increased motor coordination and less anxiety like behaviour compared to PCBs treated rats. Molecular and histological analysis supports that  the impaired motor coordination in PCBs treated rats is due to neurodegeneration in motor cortex region. The results proved that melatonin treatment improved the motor co-ordination and reduced anxiety behaviour  prevented neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex of PCBs-exposed adult male rats.,Autophagy_notLIR
CAPZA1 determines the risk of gastric carcinogenesis by inhibiting <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> CagA-degraded autophagy.<i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-derived CagA  a type IV secretion system effector  plays a role as an oncogenic driver in gastric epithelial cells. However  upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells  CagA is usually degraded by macroautophagy/autophagy. Hence  the induction of autophagy in <i>H. pylori</i>-infected epithelial cells is an important host-protective ability against gastric carcinogenesis. However  the mechanisms by which autophagosome-lysosome fusion is regulated  are unknown. Here  we report that enhancement of LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1) expression is necessary for autolysosome formation. LAMP1 expression is induced by nuclear translocated LRP1 (LDL receptor related protein 1) intracellular domain (LRP1-ICD) binding to the proximal <i>LAMP1</i> promoter region. Nuclear translocation of LRP1-ICD is enhanced by <i>H. pylori</i> infection. In contrast  CAPZA1 (capping actin protein of muscle Z-line alpha subunit 1) inhibits LAMP1 expression via binding to LRP1-ICD in the nuclei. The binding of CAPZA1 to LRP1-ICD prevents LRP1-ICD binding to the <i>LAMP1</i> proximal promoter. Thus  in CAPZA1-overexpressing gastric epithelial cells infected with <i>H. pylori</i>  autolysosome formation is inhibited and CagA escapes autophagic degradation. These findings identify CAPZA1 as a novel negative regulator of autolysosome formation and suggest that deregulation of CAPZA1 expression leads to increased risk of gastric carcinogenesis. <b>Abbreviations</b>: CagA: cytotoxin-associated gene A; CAPZA1: capping actin protein of muscle Z-line alpha subunit 1; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; GTF2I: general transcription factor IIi; HDAC: histone deacetylase; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LRP1: LDL receptor related protein 1; LRP1-ICD: CagA intracellular domain; qPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction; VacA: vacuolating cytotoxin.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1 at the onset of reperfusion protects the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy.Recent evidence indicates that GPER (G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1) mediates acute pre-ischaemic oestrogen-induced protection of the myocardium from ischaemia/reperfusion injury via a signalling cascade that includes PKC translocation  ERK1/2/ GSK-3β phosphorylation and inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Here  we investigated the impact and mechanism involved in post-ischaemic GPER activation in ischaemia/reperfusion injury. We determined whether GPER activation at the onset of reperfusion confers cardioprotective effects by protecting against mitochondrial impairment and mitophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Induction of autophagy by spermidine is neuroprotective via inhibition of caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage.Spermidine  a natural polyamine presented widely in mammalian cells  has been implicated to extend the lifespan of several model organisms by inducing autophagy. However  the effect of spermidine against neuronal damage has not yet been fully determined. In this study  neuronal cell injury was induced by treating PC12 cells and cortical neurons with 1 μM staurosporine (STS). We found that STS-induced cell injury could be efficiently attenuated by pretreatment with 1 mM spermidine. Spermidine inhibited the caspase 3 activation induced by STS. Moreover  STS incubation resulted in autophagic degradation failure  which could be attenuated by the pretreatment of spermidine. Knocking down the expression of Beclin 1 efficiently suppressed autophagosome and autolysosome accumulation  and abolished the protective effects of spermidine against STS-induced neurotoxicity. Increased Beclin 1 cleavage and partial nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment was detected in STS-treated cells  which could be blocked by spermidine  pan-caspase inhibitor or caspase 3-specific inhibitor. The nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment universally occurs in damaged neurons. Beclin 1 mutation at the sites of 146 and 149 prevented the intracellular re-distribution of Beclin 1 induced by STS. In addition  intraperitoneal injection of spermidine ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury in the hippocampus and cortex of rats  possibly via blocking caspase 3 activation and consequent Beclin 1 cleavage. Our findings suggest that caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage occurs in acute neuronal cell injury both in vitro and in vivo. The neuroprotective effect of spermidine may be related to inhibition of the caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage and restoration of the Beclin 1-dependent autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Potential ceRNA networks involved in autophagy suppression of pancreatic cancer caused by chloroquine diphosphate: A study based on differentially‑expressed circRNAs  lncRNAs  miRNAs and mRNAs.Autophagy has been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer. However  the mechanism of autophagy‑associated non‑coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in pancreatic cancer remains largely unknown. In the present study  microarrays were used to detect differential expression of mRNAs  microRNAs (miRNAs)  long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) post autophagy suppression by chloroquine diphosphate in PANC‑1 cells. Collectively  3 966 mRNAs  3 184 lncRNAs and 9 420 circRNAs were differentially expressed. Additionally  only two miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑663a‑5p and hsa‑miR‑154‑3p) were underexpressed in the PANC‑1 cells in the autophagy‑suppression group. Furthermore  miR‑663a‑5p with 9 circRNAs  8 lncRNAs and 46 genes could form a prospective ceRNA network associated with autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition  another ceRNA network containing miR‑154‑3p  5 circRNAs  2 lncRNAs and 11 genes was also constructed. The potential multiple ceRNA  miRNA and mRNA associations may serve pivotal roles in the autophagy of pancreatic cancer cells  which lays the theoretical foundation for subsequent investigations on pancreatic cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cellular stress response in human Müller cells (MIO-M1) after bevacizumab treatment.Bevacizumab  an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent  is widely used in the treatment of retinal vascular diseases. However  due to the essential role Müller cell derived-VEGF plays in the maintenance of retinal neurons and glial cells  cell viability is likely to be affected by VEGF inhibition. We therefore evaluated the effect of bevacizumab-induced VEGF inhibition on Müller cells (MIO-M1) in vitro. MIO-M1 cells were cultured for 12 or 24 h in media containing bevacizumab at 0.25 or 0.5 mg/mL. Controls were cultured in medium only. Cell viability was determined with the trypan blue exclusion test and MTT assay. Caspase-3  beclin-1  glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin content were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. Treatment with bevacizumab did not reduce MIO-M1 cell viability  but increased metabolic activity at 24 h (0.5 mg/mL) and induced apoptosis and autophagy  as shown by the increased caspase-3 levels at 12 h (0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) and the increased beclin levels at 24 h (0.5 mg/mL). Caspase-3 mRNA was upregulated at 12 h and downregulated at 24 h in cells treated with bevacizumab at 0.25 mg/mL. Bevacizumab treatment was also associated with structural protein abnormalities  with decreased GFAP and vimentin content and upregulated GFAP and vimentin mRNA expression. Although bevacizumab did not significantly affect MIO-M1 cell viability  it led to metabolic and molecular changes (apoptosis  autophagy and structural abnormalities) suggestive of significant cellular toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
A microfluidic chip for screening individual cancer cells via eavesdropping on autophagy-inducing crosstalk in the stroma niche.Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic mechanism where proteins and organelles are digested and recycled to provide an alternative source of building blocks and energy to cells. The role of autophagy in cancer microenvironment is still poorly understood. Here  we present a microfluidic system allowing monitoring of the crosstalk between single cells. We used this system to study how tumor cells induced autophagy in the stromal niche. Firstly  we could confirm that transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) secreted from breast tumor cells is a paracrine mediator of tumor-stroma interaction leading to the activation of autophagy in the stroma component fibroblasts. Through proof of concept experiments using TGFβ1 as a model factor  we could demonstrate real time monitoring of autophagy induction in fibroblasts by single tumor cells. Retrieval of individual tumor cells from the microfluidic system and their subsequent genomic analysis was possible  allowing us to determine the nature of the factor mediating tumor-stroma interactions. Therefore  our microfluidic platform might be used as a promising tool for quantitative investigation of tumor-stroma interactions  especially for and high-throughput screening of paracrine factors that are secreted from heterogeneous tumor cell populations.,Autophagy_notLIR
Consumption of pomegranates improves synaptic function in a transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular plaques containing abnormal Amyloid Beta (Aβ) aggregates  intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein  microglia-dominated neuroinflammation  and impairments in synaptic plasticity underlying cognitive deficits. Therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD are currently limited. In this study  we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation of 4% pomegranate extract to a standard chow diet on neuroinflammation  and synaptic plasticity in APPsw/Tg2576 mice brain. Treatment with a custom mixed diet (pellets) containing 4% pomegranate for 15 months ameliorated the loss of synaptic structure proteins  namely PSD-95  Munc18-1  and SNAP25  synaptophysin  phosphorylation of Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase IIα (p-CaMKIIα/ CaMKIIα)  and phosphorylation of Cyclic AMP-Response Element Binding Protein (pCREB/CREB)  inhibited neuroinflammatory activity  and enhanced autophagy  and activation of the phophoinositide-3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. These neuroprotective effects were associated with reduced β-site cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein in APPsw/Tg2576 mice. Therefore  long-term supplementation with pomegranates can attenuate AD pathology by reducing inflammation  and altering APP-dependent processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
BH3 mimetic Obatoclax (GX15-070) mediates mitochondrial stress predominantly via MCL-1 inhibition and induces autophagy-dependent necroptosis in human oral cancer cells.We have previously reported overexpression of antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein in human oral cancers and its association with therapy resistance and poor prognosis  implying it to be a potential therapeutic target. Hence  we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of Obatoclax  a BH3 mimetic pan BCL-2 inhibitor in human oral cancer cell lines. All cell lines exhibited high sensitivity to Obatoclax with complete clonogenic inhibition at 200-400 nM concentration which correlated with their MCL-1 expression. Mechanistic insights revealed that Obatoclax induced a caspase-independent cell death primarily by induction of a defective autophagy. Suppression of autophagy by ATG5 downregulation significantly blocked Obatoclax-induced cell death. Further  Obatoclax induced interaction of p62 with key components of the necrosome RIP1K and RIP3K. Necrostatin-1 mediated inhibition of RIP1K significantly protected the cells from Obatoclax induced cell death. Moreover  Obatoclax caused extensive mitochondrial stress leading to their dysfunction. Interestingly  MCL-1 downregulation alone caused mitochondrial stress  highlighting its importance for mitochondrial homeostasis. We also demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of Obatoclax against oral cancer xenografts and its synergism with ionizing radiation <i>in vitro</i>. Our studies thus suggest that Obatoclax induces autophagy-dependent necroptosis in oral cancer cells and holds a great promise in the improved management of oral cancer patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
HMGB1 promotes ERK-mediated mitochondrial Drp1 phosphorylation for chemoresistance through RAGE in colorectal cancer.Dysfunctional mitochondria have been shown to enhance cancer cell proliferation  reduce apoptosis  and increase chemoresistance. Chemoresistance develops in nearly all patients with colorectal cancer  leading to a decrease in the therapeutic efficacies of anticancer agents. However  the effect of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission on chemoresistance in colorectal cancer is unclear. Here  we found that the release of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in conditioned medium from dying cells by chemotherapeutic drugs and resistant cells  which triggered Drp1 phosphorylation via its receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE). RAGE signals ERK1/2 activation to phosphorylate Drp1 at residue S616 triggerring autophagy for chemoresistance and regrowth in the surviving cancer cells. Abolishment of Drp1 phosphorylation by HMGB1 inhibitor and RAGE blocker significantly enhance sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic treatment by suppressing autophagy. Furthermore  patients with high phospho-Drp1<sup>Ser616</sup> are associated with high risk on developing tumor relapse  poor 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Moreover  patients with RAGE-G82S polymorphism (rs2070600) are associated with high phospho-Drp1<sup>Ser616</sup> within tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that the release of HMGB1 from dying cancer cells enhances chemoresistance and regrowth via RAGE-mediated ERK/Drp1 phosphorylation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anticancer Activity of Camel Milk via Induction of Autophagic Death in Human Colorectal and Breast Cancer Cells.Background/ Objective: Camel milk is traditionally known for its human health benefits and believed to be a remedy for various human ailments including cancer. The study was aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of commercially available camel milk on cancer cells and its underlying mechanism(s). Materials and Methods: Two cell lines: colorectal cancer HCT 116 and breast cancer MCF-7 were cultured with different doses of camel milk. The effects of camel milk on cell death were determined by MTT assay  viability by trypan blue exclusion assay and migration by in vitro scratch assay. The mechanism was elucidated by western blotting and confocal microscopy was used to confirm autophagy. Results: Camel milk significantly reduced proliferation  viability as well as migration of both the cells. The accumulation of LC3-II protein along with reduction in expression of p62 and Atg 5-12  the autophagy proteins implied induction of autophagy. The (GFP)-LC3 puncta detected by confocal microscopy confirmed the autophagosome formation in response to camel milk treatment. Conclusion: Camel milk exerted antiproliferative effects on human colorectal HCT 116 and breast MCF-7 cancer cells by inducing autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genetic regulation of mitotic competence in G<sub>0</sub> quiescent cells.Quiescent (G<sub>0</sub> phase) cells must maintain mitotic competence (MC) to restart the cell cycle. This is essential for reproduction in unicellular organisms and also for development and cell replacement in higher organisms. Recently  suppression of MC has gained attention as a possible therapeutic strategy for cancer. Using a <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> deletion-mutant library  we identified 85 genes required to maintain MC during the G<sub>0</sub> phase induced by nitrogen deprivation. G<sub>0</sub> cells must recycle proteins and RNA  governed by anabolism  catabolism  transport  and availability of small molecules such as antioxidants. Protein phosphatases are also essential to maintain MC. In particular  Nem1-Spo7 protects the nucleus from autophagy by regulating Ned1  a lipin. These genes  designated GZE (G-Zero Essential) genes  reveal the landscape of genetic regulation of MC.,Autophagy_notLIR
Assessment of mTOR pathway molecules during implantation in rats.Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a member of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway that participates in cell growth  proliferation  protein synthesis  transcription  angiogenesis  apoptosis and autophagy. We investigated the role of mTOR and other signaling molecules in the rat uterus during implantation. Female pregnant rats were divided into three groups: embryonic days (ED) 4.5  5.5 and 6.5 according to vaginal smears. Immunohistochemical staining of mTORC1  mTORC2  IGF1  PI3K  pAkt1/2/3  ERK1 and pERK1/2 was performed on formalin fixed  paraffin embedded uterine tissue samples. pAkt1/2/3 and ERK1 also were analyzed using western blotting. We found that PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK/pERK were increased during the implantation period. Different amounts of mTORC1  mTORC2  IGF1  PI3K  pAKT1/2/3  ERK1 and pERK1/2 were expressed in luminal epithelium  decidual cells  embryoblast and trophoblast cells during implantation. We suggest that mTOR and associated signaling molecules may participate in implantation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Current progress  challenges and future prospects of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent  progressive and multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognition  memory and behavioural impairments. There is no approved diagnosis or cure for AD  and it affects both developed and developing countries and causes a significant social and economic burden. Extracellular senile plaques of amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the brain are considered to be the pathophysiological hallmarks of AD. In an attempt to explain the complexity and multifactorial nature of AD  various hypotheses (Aβ aggregation  Tau aggregation  metal dyshomeostasis  oxidative stress  cholinergic dysfunction  inflammation and downregulation of autophagy) based on pathophysiological changes that occur during the onset and progression of AD have been proposed. However  none of the hypotheses is capable of independently explaining the pathological conditions observed in AD. The complex and multifaceted pathophysiological nature of AD has hampered the identification and validation of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of disease-modifying therapies. Nevertheless  the amyloid hypothesis is the most widely accepted and is closely correlated with disease symptoms of AD that encompass all the disease hypotheses. Therefore  amyloid plaques are ideal biomarkers for the development of an early diagnosis of AD. Similarly  the formation of amyloid plaques can also serve as a target for the design of therapeutic tools <i>via</i> an inclusive approach that considers multiple disease pathways involved in AD. Our review article briefly introduces pathophysiological factors involved in AD using interdependent but diverse hypotheses. Recent advances in the development of effective molecular tools and techniques for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in AD  especially those in the advanced stages (clinical trials) of development  are given special consideration. In addition  contributions from our laboratory to the development of selective molecular tools for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that target multifaceted toxicity in AD are also covered. In summary  we discuss diverse aspects of molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of multifactorial AD  current progress and possible bottlenecks that have hampered the development of early diagnostic tools and effective drugs. Challenges and future prospects include the integration of various disease pathways for the successful development of an early diagnosis and effective drugs for the treatment of AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Preventive Effects of a Novel Polysaccharide from Sepia esculenta Ink on Ovarian Failure and Its Action Mechanisms in Cyclophosphamide-Treated Mice.On the basis of our findings about chemo-preventive roles of squid ink polysaccharide and the well-known toxicity of cyclophosphamide (CP) on female gonad  this research investigated the protective effects of a novel polysaccharide from Sepia esculenta ink (SEP) on the ovarian failure resulting from CP  as well as the action mechanisms underpinning this. The results indicated that CP destroyed the ovaries of mice which caused depletion of various follicles  and led to a reduction in estradiol content  increases in FSH and LH contents in sera  decreases in ovary and uterus masses and their relative mass ratios  disruption of the ultrastructure of granulosa cells  as well as induction of apoptosis and autophagy via p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. The phenomenon resulted in ovarian failure. However  SEP exposure altered the negative effects completely. The data indicated that SEP can effectively prevent ovarian failure CP caused in mice by inhibiting the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as regulated by CP. SEP was a novel polysaccharide from Sepia esculenta ink with a unique primary structure mainly composed of GalN and Ara that accounted for almost half of all monosaccharides: their ratio was nearly one-to-one. Besides  the polysaccharide contained a small number of Fuc and tiny amounts of Man  GlcN  GlcA  and GalA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Differential Regulation of the Autophagy and Proteasome Pathways in Skeletal Muscles in Sepsis.Skeletal muscle fiber atrophy develops in response to severe sepsis  but it is unclear as to how the proteolytic pathways that are involved in its development are differentially regulated.

The ER-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calreticulin couples ER stress to autophagy by associating with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3.Autophagy is of key importance for eliminating aggregated proteins during the maintenance of cellular proteostasis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However  the upstream signaling that mediates autophagy activation in response to ER stress is incompletely understood. In this study  <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> approaches were utilized that include gain- and loss-of-function assays and mouse livers and human cell lines with tunicamycin-induced pharmacological ER stress. We report that calreticulin  a quality control chaperone that binds to misfolded glycoproteins for refolding in the ER  is induced under ER stress. Calreticulin overexpression stimulated the formation of autophagosomes and increased autophagic flux. Interestingly  calreticulin was sufficient for attenuating ER stress in tunicamycin- or thapsigargin-treated HeLa cells  whereas lentivirus-mediated shRNA calreticulin knockdown exacerbated ER stress. Mechanistically  we noted that calreticulin induces autophagy by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3). Confocal microscopy revealed that the colocalization of calreticulin and LC3 at the autophagosome was enhanced under ER stress conditions. Importantly  a conserved LC3-interacting region was necessary for calreticulin-mediated stimulation of autophagy and for reducing ER stress. These findings indicate a calreticulin-based mechanism that couples ER stress to autophagy activation  which  in turn  attenuates cellular stress  likely by alleviating the formation of aberrantly folded proteins. Pharmacological or genetic approaches that activate calreticulin-autophagy signaling may have potential for managing ER stress and related cellular disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Survivin regulated by autophagy mediates hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.Diabetic vascular complications are often defined by vascular endothelial lesions. However  as a plastic cell type  whether endothelial cells could transit from quiescence to hyper-active status and hamper vascular stability upon hyperglycemia stimulation and whether this process is involved in diabetic vascular complications remain obscure. Survivin has been identified as an anti-apoptotic protein in tumor or epithelial cells by either promoting proliferation or inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore  this study aims at investigating the effects of hyperglycemia on endothelial cell status and the potential involvement of survivin. We found that high glucose (25 mM) did not cause endothelial injuries  instead  it evidently promotes endothelial proliferation and tube formation capacity indicating endothelial cell dysfunction upon hyperglycemia characterized by its preference to hyper-active status. Concomitantly  an upregulation of survivin was detected accompanied by the key component elevations of autophagy pathway including LC3  Beclin1  and p62. YM155  a specific inhibitor of survivin  could abrogate hyperglycemia-induced endothelial hyper-activation. Application of the autophagy inhibitor (3MA) and agonist (rapamycin) supported that survivin could be as a downstream effect or of autophagy. Thus  our results suggested that survivin/autophagy axis a potential therapeutic target in treatment of diabetic vascular complications.,Autophagy_notLIR
Elimination of TDP-43 inclusions linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by a misfolding-specific intrabody with dual proteolytic signals.Aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic and certain familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  suggesting elimination of TDP-43 aggregates as a possible therapeutic strategy. Here we generated and investigated a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from the 3B12A monoclonal antibody (MAb) that recognises D247 of the TDP-43 nuclear export signal  an epitope masked in the physiological state. In transfected HEK293A cells  3B12A scFv recapitulated the affinity of the full-length MAb to mislocalised TDP-43 with a defective nuclear localising signal and to a TDP-43 inclusion mimic with cysteine-to-serine substitution at RRM1. Moreover  3B12A scFv accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation of aggregated TDP-43  likely due to an endogenous PEST-like proteolytic signal sequence in the VH domain CDR2 region. Addition of the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-related signal to 3B12A scFv induced HSP70 transcription  further enhancing TDP-43 aggregate clearance and cell viability. The 3B12A scFv also reduced TDP-43 aggregates in embryonic mouse brain following in utero electroporation while causing no overt postnatal brain pathology or developmental anomalies. These results suggest that a misfolding-specific intrabody prone to synergistic proteolysis by proteasomal and autophagic pathways is a promising strategy for mitigation of TDP-43 proteinopathy in ALS.,Autophagy_notLIR
The gastric mucosal protective effects of astragaloside IV in mnng-induced GPL rats.Gastric Cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. And the occurrence of gastric carcinoma is an evolutionary histopathological stage. As a result  further research of GPL  which is a borderline of gastric cancer  is indispensable for preventing the formation and development of gastric carcinoma. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the expression of autophagy  apoptosis and Gastric cancer (GC). However  the effects of autophagy and apoptosis on human gastric cancer progression  particularly on gastric precancerous lesions (GPL)  have not totally been investigated. At present  Astragaloside IV(AS-IV) is a saponin purified from Astragalus membranaceous Bge  a traditional Chinese herb that has been widely used for more than 2000 y in the treatment of cancer  cardiovascular and immune disorders. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of AS-IV protecting gastric mucosa in N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced GPL rats. The lesions of GIM and GED were significantly ameliorated compared with the model rats  especially crowded tubular glandular and back-to-back tubular structure  which were the dangerous borderline between GPL and GC. Western Blot analysis showed that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and the protein expression of Bcl-XL  p53  Beclin1  p62  ATG5 and ATG12 were decreased and the level of Caspase3 was increased in the group of AS-IV compared with the model group; RT-PCR analysis showed that the gene expression Ambra1  Beclin1  ATG5  LC3 and p62 were decreased in the group of AS-IV compared with the model group. This research manifested that the occurrence of gastric cancer was preceded by a prolonged precancerous stage  which could be ameliorated by the AS-IV. Meanwhile  the mild and moderate stage of precancerous lesions is similar with gastric adenocarcinoma in critical biological processes  including inflammation  cell proliferation  differentiation. But this lesion is very different from cancer  because it does not appear obvious invasion and malignant lesions in this pathologic stag. Further  AS-IV could regulate p53 expression to activate the Ambra1/Beclin1 complex in GPL  and it will protect the gastric mucosal injury  prevent and cure gastric mucosal atrophy  intestinal metaplasia and atypical hyperplastic lesions. It provided a potential therapeutic strategy in reversing intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia of gastric precancerous lesions and protecting the gastric mucosa in GPL rats.,Autophagy_notLIR
GSK3β‑mediated Ser156 phosphorylation modulates a BH3‑like domain in BCL2L12 during TMZ‑induced apoptosis and autophagy in glioma cells.BH3 domains  classified initially as BCL2 homology domains  participate in both apoptosis and autophagy. Beclin‑1 contains a BH3 domain  which is required for binding to antiapoptotic BCL2 homologs and BCL2‑mediated inhibition of autophagy. BCL2‑like 12 (BCL2L12) also harbors a BH3‑like domain  which is 12 residues long and contains a LXXXAE/D motif. In a yeast two‑hybrid system performed in the present study  BCL2L12 shared similar binding partnerships to antiapoptotic BCL2 homologs  such as Beclin‑1. In addition  this BH3‑like domain was involved in anti‑apoptosis and drug‑induced autophagy in glioma cell lines. Mutations in S156 and hydrophobic L213 to alanine counteracted the antiapoptotic properties of BCL2L12 and downregulated the activation of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)  autophagy‑related (ATG)12‑ATG5 conjugates and Beclin‑1  compared with a BCL2L12 wild‑type group. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that phosphorylation at Ser156 of BCL2L12 (within α‑6 and α‑7 helices) influenced the BH3‑like domain conformation (α‑9 helix)  indicating that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β‑mediated Ser156 phosphorylation modulated a BH3‑like domain in BCL2L12. Altogether  the present findings indicated that BCL2L12 may participate in anti‑apoptosis and autophagy via a BH3‑like domain and GSK3β‑mediated phosphorylation at Ser156. Furthermore  blockade of temozolomide (TMZ)‑induced autophagy by 3‑methyladenine (3‑MA) resulted in enhanced activation of apoptotic markers  as well as tumor suppresor protein p53 (p53) expression in U87MG cells. The present results suggested that p53 and O6‑methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activation  and BCL2  BCL‑extra large  Beclin‑1 and BCL2L12 expression may be used as a detection panel to determine which patients can benefit from TMZ and ABT‑737 combination treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR

Evidence of novel miR-34a-based therapeutic approaches for multiple myeloma treatment.MiR-34a acts as tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) in several cancers  including multiple myeloma (MM)  by controlling the expression of target proteins involved in cell cycle  differentiation and apoptosis. Here  we have investigated the combination between miR-34a and γ-secretase inhibitor (γSI)  Sirtinol or zoledronic acid (ZOL) in order to enhance the inhibitory action of this miRNA on its canonical targets such as Notch1 and SIRT1  and on Ras/MAPK-dependent pathways. Our data demonstrate that miR-34a synthetic mimics significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity of all the above-mentioned anti-cancer agents in RPMI 8226 MM cells. We found that γSI enhanced miR-34a-dependent anti-tumor effects by activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway which could overcome the cytoprotective autophagic mechanism. Moreover  the combination between miR-34a and γSI increased the cell surface calreticulin (CRT) expression  that is well known for triggering anti-tumor immunological response. The combination between miR-34a and Sirtinol induced the activation of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway along with increased surface expression of CRT. Regarding ZOL  we found a powerful growth inhibition after enforced miR-34a expression  which was not likely attributable to neither apoptosis nor autophagy modulation. Based on our data  the combination of miR-34a with other anti-cancer agents appears a promising anti-MM strategy deserving further investigation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Knocking Out the Gene <i>RLS1</i> Induces Hypersensitivity to Oxidative Stress and Premature Leaf Senescence in Rice.Improving a plant's level of tolerance to oxidative stress can frequently also enhance its tolerance to several other abiotic stresses. Here  a screen of a <i>japonica</i> type rice T-DNA insertion mutant library identified a highly oxidative stress-sensitive mutant. The line exhibited premature leaf senescence  starting at the three-leaf stage  and the symptoms were particularly severe from the five-leaf stage onwards. The leaves progressively lost chlorophyll  suffered protein degradation and were compromised with respect to their photosynthetic activity; their leaf mesophyll and bulliform cells became shrunken  and several senescence-associated genes (<i>SAG</i>s)  senescence-associated transcription factor genes (<i>SATF</i>s) and autophagy-related genes (<i>ATG</i>s) were progressively up-regulated. The product of the gene inactivated by the mutation  identified via positional cloning  was putatively a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The gene was denoted here as <i>RLS1</i> (reactive oxygen species-sensitive leaf senescence1). The phenotype of plants in which <i>RLS1</i> was knocked down using RNA interference was comparable to that of the <i>rls1</i> mutant. A comparative analysis of the knock-out line and the wild type leaves showed that the former accumulated more hydrogen peroxide and more malondialdehyde  expressed a heightened level of superoxide dismutase activity and a decreased level of catalase activity  and exhibited an altered transcriptional profile with respect to several <i>SAG</i>s  <i>SATF</i>s and <i>ATG</i>s  and that these effects were magnified when the plants were exposed to oxidative stress. The product of <i>RLS1</i> is presumed to be a critical component of the rice oxidative stress response and is involved in ROS (reactive oxygen species)-mediated leaf senescence.,Autophagy_notLIR
The protease inhibitor E64d improves ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction in human aortic endothelial cells.Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced endothelial dysfunction in human vascular endothelial cells contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. E64d  a cysteine protease inhibitor  blocks the elastolytic activity of cathepsin essential for vascular matrix remodeling and reduces neurovascular endothelial apoptosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects and the underling mechanisms of E64d on ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). HAECs were treated with various concentrations of ox-LDL (0-200 mg/L) for 24 h with or without E64d. The results showed that E64d attenuated ox-LDL-induced increase in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) concentration and reduction in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression  prevented ox-LDL-induced reduction in cell viability and migration ability of HAECs. E64d decreased the protein expression of cathepsin B (CTSB)  Beclin 1  and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II  but not p62. LC3 puncta and autophagosome formation were also reduced by E64d in HAECs. Moreover  E64d decreased the production of MDA and increased the activity of SOD. The results showed that E64d ameliorated ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction in HAECs.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Role of Mitophagy in Innate Immunity.Mitochondria are cellular organelles essential for multiple biological processes  including energy production  metabolites biosynthesis  cell death  and immunological responses among others. Recent advances in the field of immunology research reveal the pivotal role of energy metabolism in innate immune cells fate and function. Therefore  the maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity and activity is a prerequisite for immune system homeostasis. Mitochondrial selective autophagy  known as mitophagy  surveils mitochondrial population eliminating superfluous and/or impaired organelles and mediating cellular survival and viability in response to injury/trauma and infection. Defective removal of damaged mitochondria leads to hyperactivation of inflammatory signaling pathways and subsequently to chronic systemic inflammation and development of inflammatory diseases. Here  we review the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy and highlight its critical role in the innate immune system homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Emerging Mechanisms in Initiating and Terminating Autophagy.Autophagy is a major degradative process activated in a rapid and transient manner to cope with stress conditions. Whether autophagy is beneficial or detrimental depends upon the rate of induction and the appropriateness of the duration. Alterations in both autophagy initiation and termination predispose the cell to death  and affect the execution of other inducible processes such as inflammation. In this review we discuss how stress signaling pathways dynamically control the activity of the autophagy machinery by mediating post-translational modifications and regulatory protein interactions. In particular  we highlight the emerging role of TRIM and CULLIN families of ubiquitin ligases which play opposite roles in the autophagy response by promoting or inhibiting  respectively  the activity of the autophagy initiation complex.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hopefully devoted to Q: targeting glutamine addiction in cancer.Altered cell metabolism enables tumours to sustain their increased energetic and biosynthetic needs. Although tumour metabolism has long been considered a promising discipline in the development of cancer therapeutics  the majority of work has focused on changes in glucose metabolism. However  the complexity of cellular metabolism means that very rarely is an individual metabolite required for a single purpose  and thus understanding the overall metabolic requirements of tumours is vital. Over the past 30 years  increasing evidence has shown that many tumours require glutamine as well as glucose for their proliferation and survival. In this minireview  we explore the complexity of glutamine metabolism in tumour cells  discussing how the overall context of the tumour dictates the requirement for glutamine and how this can affect the design of effective therapeutic strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dual Role of Mitophagy in Cancer Drug Resistance.The effectiveness of chemotherapy is largely limited by drug resistance. In the past few decades  modulation of anticancer drug resistance plays little role in benefit of clinical outcomes due to complex drug resistance mechanisms. Mitophagy  an important mitochondrial quality control system  selectively degrades excessive or damaged mitochondria by autophagy. Accumulating reports are suggesting that dysregulation of mitophagy contributes to neoplastic progression and drug resistance in various types of tumors. Mitophagy was originally thought to be an onco-suppressor that maintains cellular homeostasis and prevents oncogenic transformation. On the other hand  mitophagy promotes cancer cell survival under cytotoxic stress by degrading damaged mitochondria and reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Therefore  induction and inhibition of mitophagy in cancer drug resistance are controversial. In this review  we summarize current knowledge on the dual role of mitophagy in cancer drug resistance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Precancer Atlas to Drive Precision Prevention Trials.Cancer development is a complex process driven by inherited and acquired molecular and cellular alterations. Prevention is the holy grail of cancer elimination  but making this a reality will take a fundamental rethinking and deep understanding of premalignant biology. In this Perspective  we propose a national concerted effort to create a Precancer Atlas (PCA)  integrating multi-omics and immunity - basic tenets of the neoplastic process. The biology of neoplasia caused by germline mutations has led to paradigm-changing precision prevention efforts  including: tumor testing for mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in Lynch syndrome establishing a new paradigm  combinatorial chemoprevention efficacy in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)  signal of benefit from imaging-based early detection research in high-germline risk for pancreatic neoplasia  elucidating early ontogeny in <i>BRCA1</i>-mutation carriers leading to an international breast cancer prevention trial  and insights into the intricate germline-somatic-immunity interaction landscape. Emerging genetic and pharmacologic (metformin) disruption of mitochondrial (mt) respiration increased autophagy to prevent cancer in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model (biology reproduced in clinical pilot) and revealed profound influences of subtle changes in mt DNA background variation on obesity  aging  and cancer risk. The elaborate communication between the immune system and neoplasia includes an increasingly complex cellular microenvironment and dynamic interactions between host genetics  environmental factors  and microbes in shaping the immune response. Cancer vaccines are in early murine and clinical precancer studies  building on the recent successes of immunotherapy and HPV vaccine immune prevention. Molecular monitoring in Barrett's esophagus to avoid overdiagnosis/treatment highlights an important PCA theme. Next generation sequencing (NGS) discovered age-related clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Ultra-deep NGS reports over the past year have redefined the premalignant landscape remarkably identifying tiny clones in the blood of up to 95% of women in their 50s  suggesting that potentially premalignant clones are ubiquitous. Similar data from eyelid skin and peritoneal and uterine lavage fluid provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect the earliest phases of stem/progenitor clonal (and microenvironment) evolution/diversity with new single-cell and liquid biopsy technologies. Cancer mutational signatures reflect exogenous or endogenous processes imprinted over time in precursors. Accelerating the prevention of cancer will require a large-scale  longitudinal effort  leveraging diverse disciplines (from genetics  biochemistry  and immunology to mathematics  computational biology  and engineering)  initiatives  technologies  and models in developing an integrated multi-omics and immunity PCA - an immense national resource to interrogate  target  and intercept events that drive oncogenesis. <i>Cancer Res; 77(7); 1510-41. ©2017 AACR</i>.,Autophagy_notLIR

ATG4A promotes tumor metastasis by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem-like properties in gastric cells.The metastasis of tumor cells to distant organs is an ominous feature of gastric cancer. However  the molecular mechanisms underlying the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells remain elusive. In this study  we found that the expression of ATG4A  an autophagy-regulating molecule  was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and was significantlycorrelated with the gastric cancer differentiation degree  tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. ATG4A over-expression significantly promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo  as well as promoted gastric cancer cell stem-like properties and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. By contrast  ATG4A knockdown inhibited the migration  invasion and metastasis of cancer cells  as well as the stem-like properties and EMT phenotype. Mechanistically  ATG4A promotes gastric cancer cell stem-like properties and the EMT phenotype through the activation of Notch signaling not via autophagy  and using the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT attenuated the effects of ATG4A on gastric cancer cells. Taken together  these findings demonstrated that ATG4A promotes the metastasis of gastric cancer cells via the Notch signaling pathway  which is an autophagy-independent mechanism.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydrogen-Rich Saline Attenuates Acute Kidney Injury After Liver Transplantation via Activating p53-Mediated Autophagy.Acute kidney injury (AKI) impacts the survival of liver transplant recipients severely. To date  the related mechanism and effective therapy have not been rigorously explored.

Leucine/glutamine and v-ATPase/lysosomal acidification via mTORC1 activation are required for position-dependent regeneration.In animal regeneration  control of position-dependent cell proliferation is crucial for the complete restoration of patterned appendages in terms of both  shape and size. However  detailed mechanisms of this process are largely unknown. In this study  we identified leucine/glutamine and v-ATPase/lysosomal acidification  via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation  as effectors of amputation plane-dependent zebrafish caudal fin regeneration. mTORC1 activation  which functions in cell proliferation  was regulated by lysosomal acidification possibly via v-ATPase activity at 3 h post amputation (hpa). Inhibition of lysosomal acidification resulted in reduced growth factor-related gene expression and suppression of blastema formation at 24 and 48 hpa  respectively. Along the proximal-distal axis  position-dependent lysosomal acidification and mTORC1 activation were observed from 3 hpa. We also report that Slc7a5 (L-type amino acid transporter)  whose gene expression is position-dependent  is necessary for mTORC1 activation upstream of lysosomal acidification during fin regeneration. Furthermore  treatment with leucine and glutamine  for both proximal and distal fin stumps  led to an up-regulation in cell proliferation via mTORC1 activation  indicating that leucine/glutamine signaling possesses the ability to change the position-dependent regeneration. Our findings reveal that leucine/glutamine and v-ATPase/lysosomal acidification via mTORC1 activation are required for position-dependent zebrafish fin regeneration.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dual role of cellular prion protein in normal host and Alzheimer's disease.Using PrP<sup>C</sup>-knockout cell lines  it has been shown that the inhibition of apoptosis through STI1 is mediated by PrP<sup>C</sup>-dependent SOD activation. Antioxidant PrP<sup>C</sup> may contribute to suppression of inflammasome activation. PrP<sup>C</sup> is functionally involved in copper metabolism  signal transduction  neuroprotection  and cell maturation. Recently several reports have shown that PrP<sup>C</sup> participates in trans-membrane signaling processes associated with hematopoietic stem cell replication and neuronal differentiation. In another role  PrP<sup>C</sup> also tends to function as a neurotoxic protein. Aβ oligomer  which is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD)  has also been reported to act as a ligand of PrP<sup>C</sup>. However  the physiological role of PrP<sup>C</sup> as an Aβ<sub>42</sub>-binding protein is not clear. Actually  PrP<sup>C</sup> is critical in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-mediated autophagy in neurons. PrP<sup>C</sup> shows a beneficial role in lipid rafts to promote autophagy. Further search for PrP<sup>C</sup>-interaction molecules using Prnp<sup>-/-</sup> mice and various types of Prnp<sup>-/-</sup> cell lines under various conditions may elucidate other important PrP<sup>C</sup> important functions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Maternal exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate promotes Snail1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular epithelial cells via upregulation of TGF-β1 during renal fibrosis in rat offspring.We previously demonstrated that maternal exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) resulted in renal fibrosis in male offspring; however  the underlying mechanism governing this effect has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. We hypothesized that DBP exposure induces TGF-β expression and abnormal activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in fibrotic kidneys. Pregnant rats received DBP orally at a dose of 850 mg/kg BW/day during gestational days 14-18. In the DBP-exposed group  immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed increased expression of TGF-β1 and EMT markers. In rat kidney tubular epithelial cells (NRK52E)  ROS production increased expression levels of TGF-β1 and subsequently contributed to the induction of Snail1-mediated EMT. Notably  DBP exposure also promoted autophagy that downregulated TGF-β1. Taken together  our findings suggest that maternal exposure to DBP promotes EMT in tubular epithelial cells via upregulation of TGF-β1.,Autophagy_notLIR
Overexpression of Hypo-Phosphorylated IκBβ at Ser313 Protects the Heart against Sepsis.IκBβis an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B(NF-κB) and participates in the cardiac response to sepsis. However  the role of the hypo-phosphorylated form of IκBβ at Ser313  which can be detected during sepsis  is unknown. Here  we examined the effects of IκBβ with a mutation at Ser313→Ala313 on cardiac damage induced by sepsis. Transgenic (Tg) mice were generated to overexpress IκBβ  in which Ser-313 is replaced with alanine ubiquitously  in order to mimic the hypo-phosphorylated form of IκBβ. Survival analysis showed that Tg mice exhibited decreased inflammatory cytokine levels and decreased rates of mortality in comparison to wild type (WT) mice  after sepsis in a cecal-ligation and puncture model (CLP). Compared to WT septic mice  sepsis in Tg mice resulted in improved cardiac functions  lower levels of troponin I and decreased rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis  compared to WT mice. The increased formation of autophagicvacuoles detected with electron microscopy demonstrated the enhancement of cardiac autophagy. This phenomenon was further confirmed by the differential expression of genes related to autophagy  such as LC3  Atg5  Beclin-1  and p62. The increased expression of Cathepsin L(Ctsl)  a specific marker for mitochondrial stress response  may be associated with the beneficial effects of the hypo-phosphorylated form of IκBβ. Our observations suggest that the hypo-phosphorylated form of IκBβ at Ser313 is beneficial to the heart in sepsis through inhibition of apoptosisand enhancement of autophagy in mutated IκBβ transgenic mice.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of necrotic cell death: p53  PARP1 and cyclophilin D-overlapping pathways of regulated necrosis?In contrast to apoptosis and autophagy  necrotic cell death was considered to be a random  passive cell death without definable mediators. However  this dogma has been challenged by recent developments suggesting that necrotic cell death can also be a regulated process. Regulated necrosis includes multiple cell death modalities such as necroptosis  parthanatos  ferroptosis  pyroptosis  and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)-mediated necrosis. Several distinctive executive molecules  particularly residing on the mitochondrial inner and outer membrane  amalgamating to form the MPTP have been defined. The c-subunit of the F1F0ATP synthase on the inner membrane and Bax/Bak on the outer membrane are considered to be the long sought components that form the MPTP. Opening of the MPTP results in loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential  disruption of ATP production  increased ROS production  organelle swelling  mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent necrosis. Cyclophilin D  along with adenine nucleotide translocator and the phosphate carrier are considered to be important regulators involved in the opening of MPTP. Increased production of ROS can further trigger other necrotic pathways mediated through molecules such as PARP1  leading to irreversible cell damage. This review examines the roles of PARP1 and cyclophilin D in necrotic cell death. The hierarchical role of p53 in regulation and integration of key components of signaling pathway to elicit MPTP-mediated necrosis and ferroptosis is explored. In the context of recent insights  the indistinct role of necroptosis signaling in tubular necrosis after ischemic kidney injury is scrutinized. We conclude by discussing the participation of p53  PARP1 and cyclophilin D and their overlapping pathways to elicit MPTP-mediated necrosis and ferroptosis in acute kidney injury.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of p62 in the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production by adiponectin in macrophages: Involvement of autophagy and p21/Nrf2 axis.Adiponectin possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties. p62  an adaptor protein composed of multi-functional domain  is known to play a role in controlling inflammatory responses. In the present study  we examined the role of p62 in suppressing inflammatory cytokines produced by globular adiponectin (gAcrp) and the potential underlying mechanisms in macrophages. We demonstrated that gAcrp significantly increased p62 expression. Knockdown of p62 abrogated the suppressive effects of gAcrp on LPS-stimulated TNF-α and IL-1β expression and TRAF6/p38 MAPK pathway  indicating that p62 signaling is critical for suppressing inflammatory cytokines production by gAcrp. We next examined the role of p62 in gAcrp-induced autophagy activation  because autophagy has been shown to play a pivotal role in suppressing TNF-α. Herein  we observed that gene silencing of p62 prevented gAcrp-induced increases in autophagy-related genes and autophagosome formation. In addition  we found that Nrf2 knockdown prevented gAcrp-induced p62 expression  and p21 knockdown prevented Nrf2 induction  suggesting the role of p21/Nrf2 axis in gAcrp-induced p62 expression. Taken together  these findings imply that p62 signaling plays a crucial role in suppressing inflammatory cytokine production by globular adiponectin in macrophages  at least in part  through autophagy induction. Furthermore  the p21/Nrf2 signaling cascade contributes to p62 induction by globular adiponectin.,Autophagy_notLIR
Viability of primary cultured podocytes is associated with extracellular high glucose-dependent autophagy downregulation.Structural and functional impairment of podocytes plays an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy  a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and leading cause of renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Autophagy plays a crucial role in podocyte viability and function  and its activity is modulated by a variety of pathophysiological factors found in diabetic milieu. Here we show that downregulation of autophagy is critical for podocyte survival in hyperglycemic environment. Moreover  long-term exposure to high glucose leads to inhibition of autophagy as well as to the development of insulin resistance in podocytes. Furthermore  impairment of autophagy is involved in alteration of insulin-dependent glucose uptake in podocytes  suggesting a relationship between these two processes. Taken together  our findings suggest that downregulation of podocyte autophagy  observed after long-term exposure to high glucose  results from their suppressed sensitivity to insulin  and may therefore lead to diminished podocyte cell viability as well as their reduced number in glomerulus.,Autophagy_notLIR
Low Beclin-1 expression predicts improved overall survival in patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs for multiple myeloma and identifies autophagy inhibition as a promising potentially druggable new therapeutic target: an analysis from The Austrian Myeloma Registry (AMR).Beclin-1 is a key regulator of autophagy and has been suggested to be involved in the development of drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). We analyzed the expression of Beclin-1 in a retrospective cohort of 70 MMs. Beclin-1 expression did not influence overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with therapy-naïve MM. In patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lack of or low Beclin-1 expression resulted in a significantly improved OS and PFS compared to those treated with bortezomib or nonnovel agents. Beclin-1 expression was more frequently detected in relapsed MM than in therapy-naïve MM probably being a hallmark of tumor progression and therapy resistance. If validated prospectively  Beclin-1 expression might identify patients prone to profit above average from IMiDs and enable a more rational allocation of antimyeloma therapies. Furthermore  the inhibition of autophagy could be a new promising target to improve response to treatment in the relapsed/refractory setting.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transcriptome evidence reveals enhanced autophagy-lysosomal function in centenarians.Centenarians (CENs) are excellent subjects to study the mechanisms of human longevity and healthy aging. Here  we analyzed the transcriptomes of 76 centenarians  54 centenarian-children  and 41 spouses of centenarian-children by RNA sequencing and found that  among the significantly differentially expressed genes (SDEGs) exhibited by CENs  the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is significantly up-regulated. Overexpression of several genes from this pathway  <i>CTSB</i>  <i>ATP6V0C</i>  <i>ATG4D</i>  and <i>WIPI1</i>  could promote autophagy and delay senescence in cultured IMR-90 cells  while overexpression of the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of <i>WIPI1</i>  <i>Atg18a</i>  extended the life span in transgenic flies. Interestingly  the enhanced autophagy-lysosomal activity could be partially passed on to their offspring  as manifested by their higher levels of both autophagy-encoding genes and serum beclin 1 (BECN1). In light of the normal age-related decline of autophagy-lysosomal functions  these findings provide a compelling explanation for achieving longevity in  at least  female CENs  given the gender bias in our collected samples  and suggest that the enhanced waste-cleaning activity via autophagy may serve as a conserved mechanism to prolong the life span from <i>Drosophila</i> to humans.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure impairs autophagic degradation through a novel lysosomal acidity-independent mechanism.Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder  but its underlying cause remains unknown. Although recent studies using PD-related neurotoxin MPP<sup>+</sup> suggest autophagy involvement in the pathogenesis of PD  the effect of MPP<sup>+</sup> on autophagic processes under mild exposure  which mimics the slow progressive nature of PD  remains largely unclear. We examined the effect of mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure (10 and 200 μM for 48 h)  which induces a more slowly developing cell death  on autophagic processes and the mechanistic differences with acute MPP<sup>+</sup> toxicity (2.5 and 5 mM for 24 h). In SH-SY5Y cells  mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure predominantly inhibited autophagosome degradation  whereas acute MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure inhibited both autophagosome degradation and basal autophagy. Mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure reduced lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D activity without changing lysosomal acidity  whereas acute exposure decreased lysosomal density. Lysosome biogenesis enhancers trehalose and rapamycin partially alleviated mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure induced impaired autophagosome degradation and cell death  but did not prevent the pathogenic response to acute MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure  suggesting irreversible lysosomal damage. We demonstrated impaired autophagic degradation by MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure and mechanistic differences between mild and acute MPP<sup>+</sup> toxicities. Mild MPP<sup>+</sup> toxicity impaired autophagosome degradation through novel lysosomal acidity-independent mechanisms. Sustained mild lysosomal damage may contribute to PD. We examined the effects of MPP<sup>+</sup> on autophagic processes under mild exposure  which mimics the slow progressive nature of Parkinson's disease  in SH-SY5Y cells. This study demonstrated impaired autophagic degradation through a reduction in lysosomal cathepsin D activity without altering lysosomal acidity by mild MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure. Mechanistic differences between acute and mild MPP<sup>+</sup> toxicity were also observed. Sustained mild damage of lysosome may be an underlying cause of Parkinson's disease.

Role of autophagy in di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)-induced apoptosis in mouse Leydig cells.Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has been widely used as a plasticizer in industry. DEHP can cause testicular atrophy  yet the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study  male mice were intragastrically (i.g.) administered with 0  100  200 or 400 mg DEHP/kg/day for 21 days. We found that DEHP caused disintegration of the germinal epithelium and decreased sperm density in the epididymis. Furthermore  there was a significant increase in the levels of cleaved Caspase-8  cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax proteins and a decrease in Bcl2 protein. The results indicated that DEHP could induce apoptosis of the testis tissue. Meanwhile  DEHP significantly induced autophagy in the testis tissues with increases in LC3-II  Atg5 and Beclin-1 proteins. The serum testosterone concentration decreased in the DEHP-treated group  implying that DEHP might lead to Leydig cell damage. Furthermore  oxidative stress was induced by DEHP in the testis. To further investigate the potential mechanism  mouse TM3 Leydig cells were treated with 0-80 μM DEHP for 48 h. DEHP significantly inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. Oxidative stress was involved in DEHP-induced apoptosis as N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)  an inhibitor of oxidative stress  could rescue the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis by DEHP. Similar to the in vivo findings  DEHP could also induce cell autophagy. However  inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased cell viability and inhibited apoptosis. Taken together  oxidative stress was involved in DEHP-induced apoptosis and autophagy of mouse TM3 Leydig cells  and autophagy might play a cytotoxic role in DEHP-induced cell apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bortezomib sensitizes multiple myeloma to NK cells via ER-stress-induced suppression of HLA-E and upregulation of DR5.Although the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has significantly improved the survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM)  the disease remains fatal as most patients eventually develop progressive disease. Recent data indicate that MM cells can evade bortezomib-induced cell death by undergoing autophagy as a consequence of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-stress induced by proteasome inhibition. Here we show that bortezomib sensitizes MM cells to NK cell killing via two distinct mechanisms: a) upregulation of the TRAIL death receptor DR5 on the surface of MM cells and b) ER-stress induced reduction of cell surface HLA-E. The latter mechanism is completely novel and was found to be exclusively controlled by the inhibitory receptor NKG2A  with NKG2A single-positive (NKG2A<sup>SP</sup>) NK cells developing a selective augmentation in tumor killing as a consequence of bortezomib-induced loss of HLA-E on the non-apoptotic MM cells. In contrast  the expression of classical HLA class I molecules remained unchanged following bortezomib exposure  diminishing the augmentation of MM killing by NK cells expressing KIR. Further  we found that feeder cell-based <i>ex vivo</i> expansion of NK cells increased both NK cell TRAIL surface expression and the percentage of NKG2A<sup>SP</sup> NK cells compared to unexpanded controls  substantially augmenting their capacity to kill bortezomib-treated MM cells. Based on these findings  we hypothesize that infusion of <i>ex vivo</i> expanded NK cells following treatment with bortezomib could eradicate MM cells that would normally evade killing through proteasome inhibition alone  potentially improving long-term survival among MM patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
PGRMC1-dependent autophagy by hyperoside induces apoptosis and sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment.Cisplatin treatment some times leads to chemoresistance  which is now acknowledged partially due to the inductive expression of progesterone receptor membrane component (PGRMC)1 in ovarian cancer cells. PGRMC1 enhances autophagy  activates cytochrome p450  and inveigles signaling pathways to promote cell survival and reduce the effect of drug treatments. In this study  we give first line evidence that hyperoside inhibits cell viability  triggers autophagy and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines. Mechanistically  PGRMC1-dependent autophagy was utilized by hyperoside to induce apoptotic cell death. Hyperoside induced the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II and the formation of autophagosomes in ovarian cancer cells. Notably  PGRMC1 colocolized with LC3B‑II  and PGRMC1 overexpression enhanced hyperoside-induced autophagy and apoptosis  while PGRMC1 knockdown abrogated the action. Additionally  AKT signaling and Bcl-2 family were also involved in the hyperoside-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Importantly  in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells where PGRMC1 was overexpressed  hyperoside sensitized the cells to cisplatin treatment. Together these findings indicate hyperoside functions as a complementary therapy for ovarian cancer patients receiving platinum-based therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Novel Acylguanidine Derivatives Targeting Smoothened Induce Antiproliferative and Pro-Apoptotic Effects in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Cells.The most relevant therapeutic approaches to treat CML rely on the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like Imatinib  which are able to counteract the activity of Bcr-Abl protein increasing patient's life expectancy and survival. Unfortunately  there are some issues TKIs are not able to address; first of all TKIs are not so effective in increasing survival of patients in blast crisis  second they are not able to eradicate leukemic stem cells (LSC) which represent the major cause of disease relapse  and third patients often develop resistance to TKIs due to mutations in the drug binding site. For all these reasons it's of primary interest to find alternative strategies to treat CML. Literature shows that Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in LSC maintenance  and pharmacological inhibition of Smoothened (SMO)  one of the key molecules of the pathway  has been demonstrated to reduce Bcr-Abl positive bone marrow cells and LSC. Consequently  targeting SMO could be a promising way to develop a new treatment strategy for CML overcoming the limitations of current therapies. In our work we have tested some compounds able to inhibit SMO  and among them MRT92 appears to be a very potent SMO antagonist. We found that almost all our compounds were able to reduce Gli1 protein levels in K-562 and in KU-812 CML cell lines. Furthermore  they were also able to increase Gli1 and SMO RNA levels  and to reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis/autophagy in both the tested cell lines. Finally  we demonstrated that our compounds were able to modulate the expression of some miRNAs related to Hedgehog pathway such as miR-324-5p and miR-326. Being Hedgehog pathway deeply implicated in the mechanisms of CML we may conclude that it could be a good therapeutic target for CML and our compounds seem to be promising antagonists of such pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Icariin Activates Autophagy via Down-Regulation of the NF-κB Signaling-Mediated Apoptosis in Chondrocytes.Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic and degenerative joint condition that is mainly characterized by cartilage degradation  osteophyte formation  and joint stiffness. The NF-κB signaling pathway in inflammation  autophagy  and apoptosis plays a prominent role in the progression of OA. Icariin  a prenylated flavonol glycoside extracted from Epimedium  have been proven to exert anti-osteoporotic and anti-inflammatory effects in OA. However  the action mechanisms of its effect on chondrocytes have yet to be elucidated. In the present study  we demonstrated that the <i>in vitro</i> therapeutic effects of icariin on rat chondrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. We found that TNF-α induced the production of IL-1  IL-6  IL-12  reactive oxygen species (ROS)  nitric oxide (NO)  Caspase-3  and Caspase-9 in chondrocytes. We also provided evidence that TNF-α inhibited autophagy markers (Atg 5  Atg 7) and prevented LC3 I translate to LC3 II. Furthermore  TNF-α induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)3 and MMP9 expression. The negative effects of TNF-α on chondrocytes can be partially blocked by treating with icariin or ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC  an NF-κB inhibitor). The present study data also suggested that icariin suppressed both TNF-α-stimulated p65 nuclear translocation and IκBα protein degradation. These results indicated that icariin protected against OA by suppressing inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis  through activation of autophagy via NF-κB inhibition. In conclusion  icariin appears to favorably modulate autophagy and apoptosis in chondrocytes making it a promising compound for cartilage tissue engineering in the treatment of OA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Silvestrol induces early autophagy and apoptosis in human melanoma cells.Silvestrol is a cyclopenta[b]benzofuran that was isolated from the fruits and twigs of Aglaia foveolata  a plant indigenous to Borneo in Southeast Asia. The purpose of the current study was to determine if inhibition of protein synthesis caused by silvestrol triggers autophagy and apoptosis in cultured human cancer cells derived from solid tumors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Basal autophagy is pivotal for Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells' survival and growth revealing a new strategy for Hodgkin lymphoma treatment.As current classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) treatment strategies have pronounced side-effects  specific inhibition of signaling pathways may offer novel strategies in cHL therapy. Basal autophagy  a regulated catabolic pathway to degrade cell's own components  is in cancer linked with both  tumor suppression or promotion. The finding that basal autophagy enhances tumor cell survival would thus lead to immediately testable strategies for novel therapies. Thus  we studied its contribution in cHL.We found constitutive activation of autophagy in cHL cell lines and primary tissue. The expression of key autophagy-relevant proteins (e.g. Beclin-1  ULK1) and LC3 processing was increased in cHL cells  even in lymphoma cases. Consistently  cHL cells exhibited elevated numbers of autophagic vacuoles and intact autophagic flux. Autophagy inhibition with chloroquine or inactivation of ATG5 induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation of cHL cells. Chloroquine-mediated inhibition of basal autophagy significantly impaired HL growth in-vivo in NOD SCID γc-/- (NSG) mice. We found that basal autophagy plays a pivotal role in sustaining mitochondrial function.We conclude that cHL cells require basal autophagy for growth  survival and sustained metabolism making them sensitive to autophagy inhibition. This suggests basal autophagy as useful target for new strategies in cHL treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR

Autopsy findings in EPG5-related Vici syndrome with antenatal onset.Vici syndrome is one of the most extensive inherited human multisystem disorders and due to recessive mutations in EPG5 encoding a key autophagy regulator with a crucial role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. The condition presents usually early in life  with features of severe global developmental delay  profound failure to thrive  (acquired) microcephaly  callosal agenesis  cataracts  cardiomyopathy  hypopigmentation  and combined immunodeficiency. Clinical course is variable but usually progressive and associated with high mortality. Here  we present a fetus  offspring of consanguineous parents  in whom callosal agenesis and other developmental brain abnormalities were detected on fetal ultrasound scan (US) and subsequent MRI scan in the second trimester. Postmortem examination performed after medically indicated termination of pregnancy confirmed CNS abnormalities and provided additional evidence for skin hypopigmentation  nascent cataracts  and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Genetic testing prompted by a suggestive combination of features revealed a homozygous EPG5 mutation (c.5870-1G>A) predicted to cause aberrant splicing of the EPG5 transcript. Our findings expand the phenotypical spectrum of EPG5-related Vici syndrome and suggest that this severe condition may already present in utero. While callosal agenesis is not an uncommon finding in fetal medicine  additional presence of hypopigmentation  cataracts and cardiomyopathy is rare and should prompt EPG5 testing.,Autophagy_notLIR
Weak by the machines: muscle motor protein dysfunction - a side effect of intensive care unit treatment.Intensive care interventions involve periods of mechanical ventilation  sedation and complete mechanical silencing of patients. Critical illness myopathy (CIM) is an ICU-acquired myopathy that is associated with limb muscle weakness  muscle atrophy  electrical silencing of muscle and motor proteinopathy. The hallmark of CIM is a preferential muscle myosin loss due to increased catabolic and reduced anabolic activity. The ubiquitin proteasome pathway plays an important role  apart from recently identified novel mechanisms affecting non-lysosomal protein degradation or autophagy. CIM is not reproduced by pure disuse atrophy  denervation atrophy  steroid-induced atrophy or septic myopathy  although combinations of high-dose steroids and denervation can mimic CIM. New animal models of critical illness and ICU treatment (i.e. mechanical ventilation and complete immobilization) provide novel insights regarding the time course of protein synthesis and degradation alterations  and the role of protective chaperone activities in the process of myosin loss. Altered mechano-signalling seems involved in triggering a major part of myosin loss in experimental CIM models  and passive loading of muscle potently ameliorates the CIM phenotype. We provide a systematic overview of similarities and distinct differences in the signalling pathways involved in triggering muscle atrophy in CIM and isolated trigger factors. As preferential myosin loss is mostly determined from biochemistry analyses providing no spatial resolution of myosin loss processes within myofibres  we also provide first results monitoring myosin signal intensities during experimental ICU intervention using multi-photon Second Harmonic Generation microscopy. Our results confirm that myosin loss is an evenly distributed process within myofibres rather than being confined to hot spots.,Autophagy_notLIR
Endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response profile in quadriceps of sarcopenic patients with respiratory diseases.Impaired muscle strength and mass (sarcopenia) are common in patients with respiratory cachexia  namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in lung cancer (LC)-cachexia. Misfolded/unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce the compensatory unfolded protein response (UPR). Expression of ER stress and UPR markers may be differentially upregulated in vastus lateralis (VL) of patients with respiratory sarcopenia associated with either a chronic condition (COPD) or subacute (LC)-cachexia. In VL specimens from 40 COPD patients (n = 21  sarcopenic  fat-free mass index [FFMI] 16 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and n = 19  nonsarcopenic  FFMI 18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> )  13 patients with LC-cachexia (FFMI 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup> )  and 19 healthy controls (FFMI 19 kg/m <sup>2</sup> )  expression markers of ER stress  UPR (protein kinase-like ER kinase [PERK]  activating transcription factor [ATF] 6  and inositol-requiring enzyme [IRE] 1-α)  oxidative stress  autophagy  proteolysis  and apoptosis (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting)  and fiber atrophy (histology) were assessed. Atrophy and muscle wasting and weakness were seen in both groups of sarcopenic patients. Compared to healthy controls  in muscles of LC-cachexia patients  expression of ER stress markers and UPR (three arms) was significantly upregulated  while in sarcopenic COPD  expression of a few ER stress markers and IRE1-α arm was upregulated. ER stress and an exaggerated UPR were observed in the VL muscle of patients with respiratory sarcopenia. The three branches of UPR were similarly upregulated in muscles of cancer cachectic patients  whereas in sarcopenic COPD patients  only IRE1 was upregulated. The differential profile of muscle UPR in chronic and subacute respiratory conditions offers a niche for the design of specific novel therapeutic approaches.,Autophagy_notLIR
Glucocorticoid-Induced Autophagy Protects Osteocytes Against Oxidative Stress Through Activation of MAPK/ERK Signaling.Autophagy confers protective or detrimental effects on cells depending on the cellular context. We showed here that oxidative stress-induced cell death in osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells coincided with decreased autophagy. Decreased autophagy was also observed in osteocytes of superoxide dismutase 1- (SOD1-) deficient mice. Oxidative stress-induced osteocyte death was exacerbated by an autophagy inhibitor  chloroquine  suggesting a protective function of basal autophagy levels against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Pretreatment with dexamethasone reduced the susceptibility of osteocytes to oxidative stress-induced cell death and conferred protection against TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cell death. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK attenuated the formation of autophagosome  leading to increased osteocyte cell death. Taken together  our results suggest that autophagy  induced by moderate levels of glucocorticoids  leads to the preconditioning of osteocytes and conveys a novel cell-protective function against cell death induced by oxidative stress and other insults. © 2018 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> is published by Wiley Periodicals  Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pigment Epithelium-derived Factor (PEDF) Blocks Wnt3a Protein-induced Autophagy in Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasms.An increase in autophagy characterizes pancreatic carcinogenesis  but the signals that regulate this process are incompletely understood. Because canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for the transition from early to advanced pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions  we assessed whether Wnt ligands and endogenous inhibitors of Wnt signaling modulate autophagy. In this study  canonical Wnt3a ligand induced autophagy markers and vacuoles in murine PanIN cells. Furthermore  pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)  a secreted glycoprotein known for its anti-tumor properties  blocked Wnt3a-directed induction of autophagy proteins. Autophagy inhibition was complemented by reciprocal regulation of the oxidative stress enzymes  superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase. Transcriptional control of Sod2 expression was mediated by PEDF-induced NFκB nuclear translocation. PEDF-dependent SOD2 expression in PanIN lesions was recapitulated in a murine model of PanIN formation where PEDF was deleted. In human PanIN lesions  co-expression of PEDF and SOD2 was observed in the majority of early PanIN lesions (47/50  94%)  whereas PEDF and SOD2 immunolocalization in high-grade human PanIN-2/3 was uncommon (7/50  14%). These results indicate that PEDF regulates autophagy through coordinate Wnt signaling blockade and NFκB activation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagic Degradation of NBR1 Restricts Metastatic Outgrowth during Mammary Tumor Progression.Although autophagy is being pursued as a therapeutic target in clinical oncology trials  its effects on metastasis  the principal cause of cancer mortality  remain unclear. Here  we utilize mammary cancer models to temporally delete essential autophagy regulators during carcinoma progression. Though genetic ablation of autophagy strongly attenuates primary mammary tumor growth  impaired autophagy promotes spontaneous metastasis and enables the outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells into overt macro-metastases. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that autophagy deficiency elicits a subpopulation of otherwise luminal tumor cells exhibiting basal differentiation traits  which is reversed upon preventing accumulation of the autophagy cargo receptor  Neighbor to BRCA1 (NBR1). Furthermore  pharmacological and genetic induction of autophagy suppresses pro-metastatic differentiation and metastatic outgrowth. Analysis of human breast cancer data reveal that autophagy gene expression inversely correlates with pro-metastatic differentiation signatures and predicts overall and distant metastasis-free survival. Overall  these findings highlight autophagy-dependent control of NBR1 as a key determinant of metastatic progression.,Autophagy_notLIR
6-Azauridine Induces Autophagy-Mediated Cell Death via a p53- and AMPK-Dependent Pathway.6-Azauridine (6-AZA)  a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue  is known to exhibit both antitumor and antiviral activities. Although 6-AZA was discovered more than 60 years ago  the cellular effects of this compound are yet to be elucidated. Here  we report that 6-AZA regulates autophagy-mediated cell death in various human cancer cells  where 6-AZA treatment activates autophagic flux through the activation of lysosomal function. Furthermore  6-AZA exhibited cytotoxicity in all cancer cells studied  although the mechanisms of action were diverse. In H460 cells  6-AZA treatment induced apoptosis  and the extent of the latter could be reduced by treatment with chloroquine (CQ)  a lysosomal inhibitor. However  6-AZA treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells  which could not be reversed by CQ. The cytotoxicity associated with 6-AZA treatment could be linearly correlated to the degree of autophagy-mediated cell death. In addition  we demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of 6-AZA was dependent on AMPK and p53. These results collectively indicate that autophagy-mediated cell death triggered by 6-AZA contributes to its antitumor effect.,Autophagy_notLIR
GNS561  a new lysosomotropic small molecule  for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Among the acquired modifications in cancer cells  changes in lysosomal phenotype and functions are well described  making lysosomes a potential target for novel therapies. Some weak base lipophilic drugs have a particular affinity towards lysosomes  taking benefits from lysosomal trapping to exert anticancer activity. Here  we have developed a new lysosomotropic small molecule  GNS561  and assessed its activity in multiple in vitro intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma models (HuCCT1 and RBE cell lines and patient-derived cells) and in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane xenograft model. GNS561 significantly reduced cell viability in two intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.5 ± 0.2 μM in HuCCT1 and IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.7 ± 0.1 μM in RBE cells) and induced apoptosis as measured by caspases activation. We confirmed that GNS561-mediated cell death was related to its lysosomotropic properties. GNS561 induced lysosomal dysregulation as proven by inhibition of late-stage autophagy and induction of a dose-dependent build-up of enlarged lysosomes. In patient-derived cells  GNS561 was more potent than cisplatin and gemcitabine in 2/5 and 1/5 of the patient-derived cells models  respectively. Moreover  in these models  GNS561 was potent in models with low sensitivity to gemcitabine. GNS561 was also efficient in vivo against a human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane xenograft model  with a good tolerance at doses high enough to induce an antitumor effect in this model. In summary  GNS561 is a new lysosomotropic agent  with an anticancer activity against intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Further investigations are currently ongoing to fully elucidate its mechanism of action.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bach2 regulates autophagy to modulate UVA-induced photoaging in skin fibroblasts.Senescence is a cellular process that can be initiated by certain stressors such as UVA irradiation. The mechanism by which skin cells protect themselves from the UVA-induced senescence has not been fully investigated. Here  we demonstrate that Bach2 modulates the extent of UVA-induced photoaging through regulation of autophagy in skin fibroblasts. In fact chronic exposure of skin fibroblasts to UVA resulted in a significant decrease in Bach2 expression  both in vitro and in vivo. In addition  knockdown of Bach2 in skin fibroblasts led to an increased expression of cell senescence-related genes  which further enhanced the UVA irradiation-induced photoaging. On the other hand  the overexpression of Bach2 resulted in a decrease in the expression of cell senescence-related genes. We also demonstrate that the knockdown of Bach2 in skin fibroblasts can lead to a decreased expression of autophagy-related genes and vice versa  suggesting that autophagy is involved in Bach2-mediated regulation of senescence in skin fibroblasts. Additionally  inhibition of autophagy with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA suppressed the expression of autophagy-related proteins and promoted cell senescence. Furthermore  knockout of Atg5 or Atg7 in embryonic mouse fibroblasts led to a significant increase in the expression of cell senescence-related genes. Immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that Bach2 directly interacts with Beclin-1  Atg3  Atg7  and LC3 in fibroblasts. Taken together  these findings revealed a critical role for Bach2 in suppressing the UVA irradiation-induced cell senescence via autophagy in skin fibroblasts. Bach2 can therefore be a potential target for the therapy of UV-induced photoaging because of its ability to regulate the process of autophagy in the skin.,Autophagy_notLIR
Assessing Autophagy in the Leydig Cells.Autophagy is an important intracellular degradation system which is implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. During autophagy  cytosolic constituents such as organelles and macromolecules are engulfed by autophagosome  and then they fuse with lysosomes for degradation and recycle of the engulfed components within the autolysosome to maintain cellular homeostasis. In male testis  the Leydig cells provide the major source of testosterone production. Autophagy is extremely active in Leydig cells and is involved in the steroid production. However  the precise role of autophagy in Leydig cells is still largely unknown. Thus  a comprehensive measurement of autophagic activity with different methods would shed light on our knowledge about the functional role of autophagy in regulating male reproductive physiology. In this chapter  we describe the morphological  cellular  and biochemical methods to monitor autophagy in Leydig cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Experimental Study Using Multiple Strains of Prion Disease in Cattle Reveals an Inverse Relationship between Incubation Time and Misfolded Prion Accumulation  Neuroinflammation  and Autophagy.Proteinopathies result from aberrant folding and accumulation of specific proteins. Currently  there is a lack of knowledge about the factors that influence disease progression  making this a key challenge for the development of therapies for proteinopathies. Because of the similarities between transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and other protein misfolding diseases  TSEs can be used to understand other proteinopathies. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a TSE that occurs in cattle and can be subdivided into three strains: classic BSE and atypical BSEs (H and L types) that have shorter incubation periods. The NACHT  LRR  and PYD domains-containing protein 3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system that leads to release of IL-1β. Macroautophagy is an intracellular mechanism that plays an essential role in protein clearance. In this study  the retina was used as a model to investigate the relationship between disease incubation period  prion protein accumulation  neuroinflammation  and changes in macroautophagy. We demonstrate that atypical BSEs present with increased prion protein accumulation  neuroinflammation  and decreased autophagy. This work suggests a relationship between disease time course  neuroinflammation  and the autophagic stress response  and may help identify novel therapeutic biomarkers that can delay or prevent the progression of proteinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rapamycin- and starvation-induced autophagy are associated with miRNA dysregulation in A549 cells.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-23 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. In recent years  deep sequencing of the transcription is being increasingly utilized with the promise of higher sensitivity for the identification of differential expression patterns as well as the opportunity to discover new transcripts  including new alternative isoforms and miRNAs. In this study  miRNAs from A549 cells treated with/without rapamycin or starvation were subject to genome-wide deep sequencing. A total of 1534 miRNAs were detected from the rapamycin- and starvation-treated A549 cells. Among them  31 miRNAs were consistently upregulated and 131 miRNAs were downregulated in the treated cells when compared with the untreated cells. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of the predicted target genes of the most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that the autophagy-related miRNAs are involved in cancer pathway. Taken together  our findings indicate that the underlying mechanism responsible for autophagy is associated with dysregulation of miRNAs in rapamycin- or starvation-induced A549 cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
<i>CircNF1-419</i> improves the gut microbiome structure and function in AD-like mice.Our pre-experiments found that the brain circRNA sequence profiles and gut microbiota in AD-like mice were changed  as circNF1-419 could enhance autophagy to ameliorate senile dementia in AD-like mice  so we conclude that there might some connections between circRNA and gut microbiome. Therefore  we use the over-expressed <i>circNF1-419</i> adeno-associated virus (AAV) animal system with the aim of identifying possible connections. Our results showed that over-expression of circ<i>NF1-419</i> in brain not only influenced the cholinergic system of brain  but also changed the gut microbiota composition as the <i>Candidatus Arthromitus</i>  <i>Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group</i>  <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG-006</i>  and [Eubacterium] <i>xylanophilum group</i>  and the intestinal homeostasis and physiology  and even the gut microbiota trajectory in new born mice. These findings demonstrate a link between circRNA and gut microbiome  enlarge the 'microbiome- transcriptome' linkage library and provide more information on gut-brain axis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Vitamin D-regulated Gene Expression Profiles: Species-specificity and Cell-specific Effects on Metabolism and Immunity.Vitamin D has pleiotropic physiological actions including immune system regulation  in addition to its classical role in calcium homeostasis. Hormonal 1 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1 25D) signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor  and large-scale expression profiling has provided numerous insights into its diverse physiological roles. To obtain a comprehensive picture of vitamin D signaling  we analyzed raw data from 94 (80 human  14 mouse) expression profiles of genes regulated by 1 25D or its analogs. This identified several thousand distinct genes directly or indirectly up- or downregulated in a highly cell-specific manner in human cells using a 1.5-fold cut-off. There was significant overlap of biological processes regulated in human and mouse but minimal intersection between genes regulated in each species. Disease ontology clustering confirmed roles for 1 25D in immune homeostasis in several human cell types  and analysis of canonical pathways revealed novel and cell-specific roles of vitamin D in innate immunity. This included cell-specific regulation of several components of Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-like (NOD-like) pattern recognition receptor signaling  and metabolic events controlling innate immune responses. Notably  1 25D selectively enhanced catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in monocytic cells. BCAA levels regulate the major metabolic kinase mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)  and pretreatment with 1 25D suppressed BCAA-dependent activation of mTOR signaling. Furthermore  ablation of BCAT1 expression in monocytic cells blocked 1 25D-induced increases in autophagy marker LAMP1. In conclusion  the data generated represents a powerful tool to further understand the diverse physiological roles of vitamin D signaling and provides multiple insights into mechanisms of innate immune regulation by 1 25D.,Autophagy_notLIR
PKG1-modified TSC2 regulates mTORC1 activity to counter adverse cardiac stress.The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) coordinates regulation of growth  metabolism  protein synthesis and autophagy<sup>1</sup>. Its hyperactivation contributes to disease in numerous organs  including the heart<sup>1 2</sup>  although broad inhibition of mTORC1 risks interference with its homeostatic roles. Tuberin (TSC2) is a GTPase-activating protein and prominent intrinsic regulator of mTORC1 that acts through modulation of RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain). TSC2 constitutively inhibits mTORC1; however  this activity is modified by phosphorylation from multiple signalling kinases that in turn inhibits (AMPK and GSK-3β) or stimulates (AKT  ERK and RSK-1) mTORC1 activity<sup>3-9</sup>. Each kinase requires engagement of multiple serines  impeding analysis of their role in vivo. Here we show that phosphorylation or gain- or loss-of-function mutations at either of two adjacent serine residues in TSC2 (S1365 and S1366 in mice; S1364 and S1365 in humans) can bidirectionally control mTORC1 activity stimulated by growth factors or haemodynamic stress  and consequently modulate cell growth and autophagy. However  basal mTORC1 activity remains unchanged. In the heart  or in isolated cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts  protein kinase G1 (PKG1) phosphorylates these TSC2 sites. PKG1 is a primary effector of nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide signalling  and protects against heart disease<sup>10-13</sup>. Suppression of hypertrophy and stimulation of autophagy in cardiomyocytes by PKG1 requires TSC2 phosphorylation. Homozygous knock-in mice that express a phosphorylation-silencing mutation in TSC2 (TSC2(S1365A)) develop worse heart disease and have higher mortality after sustained pressure overload of the heart  owing to mTORC1 hyperactivity that cannot be rescued by PKG1 stimulation. However  cardiac disease is reduced and survival of heterozygote Tsc2<sup>S1365A</sup> knock-in mice subjected to the same stress is improved by PKG1 activation or expression of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation (TSC2(S1365E)). Resting mTORC1 activity is not altered in either knock-in model. Therefore  TSC2 phosphorylation is both required and sufficient for PKG1-mediated cardiac protection against pressure overload. The serine residues identified here provide a genetic tool for bidirectional regulation of the amplitude of stress-stimulated mTORC1 activity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of Cathepsin S Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cell Lines Through Mitochondrial Stress and Autophagosome Accumulation.Cathepsin S (CTSS)  a lysosomal cysteine protease  is overexpressed in various cancers  including glioblastoma (GB). A high level of CTSS is associated with tumor progression and poor outcome in GB. However  the underlying mechanisms of its role in the biological characteristics of G5B remain to be elucidated. Here  we uncovered a potential role of CTSS in the lysosomes and mitochondria of GB cells (GBCs). Downregulation of CTSS in GBCs could increase the expression of autophagy-related proteins; however  there was no significant change in p62  suggesting autophagy blockade. Moreover  inhibition of CTSS increased the expression of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and enhanced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake ability  causing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload  the generation of copious reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventual mitochondrial apoptosis. Additionally  elevated damage to mitochondria exacerbated the burden of autophagy. Finally  we found that silence of MCU could alleviate the inhibition of CTSS-induced autophagosome accumulation and mitochondrial stress. Collectively  these results demonstrate that CTSS plays an important role in the process of autophagic flux and mitochondrial functions in GBCs.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Role of Autophagy and Autophagy Receptor NDP52 in Microbial Infections.Autophagy is a general protective mechanism for maintaining homeostasis in eukaryotic cells  regulating cellular metabolism  and promoting cell survival by degrading and recycling cellular components under stress conditions. The degradation pathway that is mediated by autophagy receptors is called selective autophagy  also named as xenophagy. Autophagy receptor NDP52 acts as a 'bridge' between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system  and it also plays an important role in the process of selective autophagy. Pathogenic microbial infections cause various diseases in both humans and animals  posing a great threat to public health. Increasing evidence has revealed that autophagy and autophagy receptors are involved in the life cycle of pathogenic microbial infections. The interaction between autophagy receptor and pathogenic microorganism not only affects the replication of these microorganisms in the host cell  but it also affects the host's immune system. This review aims to discuss the effects of autophagy on pathogenic microbial infection and replication  and summarizes the mechanisms by which autophagy receptors interact with microorganisms. While considering the role of autophagy receptors in microbial infection  NDP52 might be a potential target for developing effective therapies to treat pathogenic microbial infections.,Autophagy_notLIR
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in osteoarthritis: a narrative review.Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complicated degenerative disease that affects whole joint tissue. Currently  apart from surgical approaches to treat late stage OA  effective treatments to reverse OA are not available. Thus  the mechanisms leading to OA  and more effective approaches to treat OA should be investigated. According to available evidence  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is essential for normal metabolism of joint tissues  but is also involved in development of OA. To provide a wide viewpoint to roles of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in osteoarthritis  a comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed terms 'PI3K OR AKT OR mTOR' and 'osteoarthritis'. This review highlights the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in cartilage degradation  subchondral bone dysfunction  and synovial inflammation  and discusses how this signaling pathway affects development of the disease. We also summarize recent evidences of therapeutic approaches to treat OA by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway  and discuss potential challenges in developing these strategies for clinical treatment of OA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Experimental Evidence of the Benefits of Acupuncture for Alzheimer's Disease: An Updated Review.As the global population ages  the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  the most common form of dementia  is also increasing. At present  there are no widely recognized drugs able to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction caused by AD. The failure of several promising clinical trials in recent years has highlighted the urgent need for novel strategies to both prevent and treat AD. Notably  a growing body of literature supports the efficacy of acupuncture for AD. In this review  we summarize the previously reported mechanisms of acupuncture's beneficial effects in AD  including the ability of acupuncture to modulate Aβ metabolism  tau phosphorylation  neurotransmitters  neurogenesis  synapse and neuron function  autophagy  neuronal apoptosis  neuroinflammation  cerebral glucose metabolism  and brain responses. Taken together  these findings suggest that acupuncture provides therapeutic effects for AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Effect of FOXC2-AS1 on White Adipocyte Browning and the Possible Regulatory Mechanism.Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic  and obesity-related problems are becoming more severe in public health. Increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass or/and activity in mice and humans has been demonstrated to help lose weight and improve whole-body metabolism. Studies on the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to BAT under certain conditions have provided new possibilities for treating obesity and the related disorders. It has been established that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of mouse adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic programs; however  the function and potential mechanism of lncRNA in the process of human white adipocyte browning remains unclear. In the present study  we identified a lncRNA called Forkhead Box C2 antisense RNA 1 (FOXC2-AS1)  which was first identified in osteosarcoma  and it was highly expressed in human adipocytes but decreased during the white adipocyte differentiation program. FOXC2-AS1 expression was also induced by the thermogenic agent forskolin. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of FOXC2-AS1 in human white adipocytes did not affect lipid drop accumulation  but significantly promoted the browning phenotype  as revealed by the increased respiratory capacity and the enhanced protein expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific markers. In contrast  inhibiting FOXC2-AS1 with small interfering RNA led to attenuated thermogenic capacity in human white adipocytes. RNA-sequencing analysis and western blot were used to identify a possible regulatory role of the autophagy signaling pathway in FOXC2-AS1 to mediate white-to-brown adipocyte conversion. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine restored the reduced UCP1 protein level and thermogenic capacity caused by inhibiting FOXC2-AS1. Overall  the present study characterized the potential role of FOXC2-AS1 and further identified a lncRNA-mediated mechanism for inducing browning of human white adipocytes and maintaining thermogenesis  further providing a potential strategy for treating obesity and related disorder.,Autophagy_notLIR
β<sub>2</sub>-AR blockade potentiates MEK1/2 inhibitor effect on HNSCC by regulating the Nrf2-mediated defense mechanism.The β2-Adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)  involved in the development of many cancers  among which HNSCC. In this contest  β2-AR signaling interacts with different pathways  such as PI3K and MAPK  commonly activated by TK receptors. For this reason  TK blockade is one of the most adopted therapeutic strategies in HNSCC patients. In our study we investigated the effects of the β2-AR blocking in HNSCC cell lines  using the selective inhibitor ICI118 551 (ICI)  in combination with the MAPK inhibitor U0126. We found that ICI leads to the blocking of p38 and NF-kB oncogenic pathways  strongly affecting also the ERK and PI3K pathways. Cotreatment with U0126 displays a synergic effect on cell viability and pathway alteration. Interestingly  we found that the β2-AR blockade affects Nrf2-Keap1 stability and its nuclear translocation leading to a drastic ROS increase and oxidative stress. Our results are confirmed by a TCGA dataset analysis  showing that NFE2L2 gene is commonly overexpressed in HNSC  and correlated with a lower survival rate. In our system  the PI3K pathway inhibition culminated in the blocking of pro-survival autophagy  a mechanism normally adopted by cancer cells to became less responsive to the therapies. The mTOR expression  commonly upregulated in HNSC  was reduced in patients with disease-recurrence. It is well known that mTOR has a strong autophagy inhibition effect  therefore its downregulation promoted pro-survival autophagy  with a related increase recurrence rate. Our findings highlight for the first time the key role of β2-AR and related pathway in HNSCC cell proliferation and drug resistance  proposing it as a valuable therapeutic molecular target.,Autophagy_notLIR
Integrative structure and function of the yeast exocyst complex.Exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved hetero-octameric tethering complex that plays a variety of roles in membrane trafficking  including exocytosis  endocytosis  autophagy  cell polarization  cytokinesis  pathogen invasion  and metastasis. Exocyst serves as a platform for interactions between the Rab  Rho  and Ral small GTPases  SNARE proteins  and Sec1/Munc18 regulators that coordinate spatial and temporal fidelity of membrane fusion. However  its mechanism is poorly described at the molecular level. Here  we determine the molecular architecture of the yeast exocyst complex by an integrative approach  based on a 3D density map from negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) at ~16 Å resolution  434 disuccinimidyl suberate and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride cross-links from chemical-crosslinking mass spectrometry  and partial atomic models of the eight subunits. The integrative structure is validated by a previously determined cryo-EM structure  cross-links  and distances from in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Our subunit configuration is consistent with the cryo-EM structure  except for Sec5. While not observed in the cryo-EM map  the integrative model localizes the N-terminal half of Sec3 near the Sec6 subunit. Limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the conformation of Exo70 is dynamic  which may have functional implications for SNARE and membrane interactions.

Trehalose suppresses cadmium-activated Nrf2 signaling pathway to protect against spleen injury.Cadmium (Cd)  as a kind of ubiquitous and highly toxic heavy metal pollutants  has been known to result in immunotoxicity in animals. As a multifunctional bioactivity disaccharide  trehalose (Tre) is characterized by antioxidative  antiapoptotic  and accelerating autophagy. In this study  Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed with cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) and/or Tre to explore the molecular mechanisms of Tre-protected against spleen injury caused by Cd exposure. Firstly  the results showed that Tre partially recovered splenic pathological changes induced by Cd exposure. Secondly  Tre dramatically declined the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) and elevated the level of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) to weaken oxidative stress caused by Cd exposure in spleen tissue. Moreover  the results showed that Tre significantly suppressed Cd-induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and up-regulated the protein expression of nuclear Nrf2. Thirdly  Tre remarkably reduced the protein expression of sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3II (LC-3II) to restore autophagy inhibition induced by Cd exposure. Finally  the results of TUNEL and the expression of apoptosis marker proteins showed that Tre significantly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis in spleen tissue to exert its protective effects. In summary  the results indicated that Tre modulated Nrf2 signaling pathway  which interacted with apoptosis and autophagy to against Cd-induced spleen injury  providing potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of Cd-related immune system diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transcriptome Analyses Reveal Effects of Vitamin C-Treated Donor Cells on Cloned Bovine Embryo Development.Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a very powerful technique used to produce genetically identical or modified animals. However  the cloning efficiency in mammals remains low. In this study  we aimed to explore the effects of vitamin C (Vc)-treated donor cells on cloned embryos. As a result  Vc treatment relaxed the chromatin of donor cells and improved cloned embryo development. RNA sequencing was adopted to investigate the changes in the transcriptional profiles in early embryos. We found that Vc treatment increased the expression of genes involved in the cell-substrate adherens junction. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that Vc treatment facilitated the activation of autophagy  which was deficient in cloned two-cell embryos. Rapamycin  an effective autophagy activator  increased the formation of cloned blastocysts (36.0% vs. 25.6%  <i>p</i> < 0.05). Abnormal expression of some coding genes and long non-coding RNAs in cloned embryos was restored by Vc treatment  including the zinc-finger protein 641 (ZNF641)<i>. ZNF641</i> compensation by means of mRNA microinjection improved the developmental potential of cloned embryos. Moreover  Vc treatment rescued some deficient RNA-editing sites in cloned two-cell embryos. Collectively  Vc-treated donor cells improved the development of the cloned embryo by affecting embryonic transcription. This study provided useful resources for future work to promote the reprogramming process in SCNT embryos.,Autophagy_notLIR
A Mammalian Mitophagy Receptor  Bcl2-L-13  Recruits the ULK1 Complex to Induce Mitophagy.Degradation of mitochondria by selective autophagy  termed mitophagy  contributes to the control of mitochondrial quality. Bcl2-L-13 is a mammalian homolog of Atg32  which is an essential mitophagy receptor in yeast. However  the molecular machinery involved in Bcl2-L-13-mediated mitophagy remains to be elucidated. Here  we show that the ULK1 (unc-51-like kinase) complex is required for Bcl2-L-13 to process mitophagy. Screening of a series of yeast Atg mutants revealed that a different set of ATG genes is used for Bcl2-L-13- and Atg32-mediated mitophagy in yeast. The components of the Atg1 complex essential for starvation-induced autophagy were indispensable in Bcl2-L-13-  but not Atg32-mediated  mitophagy. The ULK1 complex  a counterpart of the Atg1 complex  is necessary for Bcl2-L-13-mediated mitophagy in mammalian cells. We propose a model where  upon mitophagy induction  Bcl2-L-13 recruits the ULK1 complex to process mitophagy and the interaction of LC3B with ULK1  as well as Bcl2-L-13  is important for the mitophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Dual Role of Autophagy in Diseases of the Central Nervous System.Autophagy is a vital lysosomal degradation and recycling pathway in the eukaryotic cell  responsible for maintaining an intricate balance between cell survival and cell death  necessary for neuronal survival and function. This dual role played by autophagy raises the question whether this process is a protective or a destructive pathway  the contributor of neuronal cell death or a failed attempt to repair aberrant processes? Deregulated autophagy at different steps of the pathway  whether excessive or downregulated  has been proposed to be associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's-  Huntington's-  and Parkinson's-disease  known for their intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates. Recent observations of impaired autophagy also appeared in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggesting an additional contribution to the pathophysiology of mental illness. Here we review the current understanding of autophagy's role in various neuropsychiatric disorders and  hitherto  the prevailing new potential autophagy-related therapeutic strategies for their treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysosome Targeting RedGreen-assay: Selective Autophagy Sensing Assay for Mammalian Cells.The process of autophagy is an essential cellular mechanism  required to maintain general cell health through the removal of dysfunctional organelles  such as the ER  peroxisomes and mitochondria  as well as protein aggregates  and bacteria. Autophagy is an extremely dynamic process  and tools are constantly being developed to study the various steps of this process. This protocol details a method to study the end steps of autophagy-lysosomal fusion and the formation of the autolysosome. Many techniques have been used to study the various steps of the autophagy process. Here we describe the RedGreen-assay (RG-assay)  an immunofluorescence-based technique used to visualize the targeting of substrates to the autolysosome in live cells. This technique takes advantage of the low lysosomal pH and over-expression of a tandem GFP-mCherry tagged protein targeted to an organelle of interest. While in the neutral cytosol or autophagosome  both GFP and RFP will fluoresce. However  within the autolysosome  the GFP signal is quenched due to the low pH environment and the RFP emission signal will predominate. This technique is readily quantifiable and amenable to high throughput experiments. Additionally  by tagging the GFP-RFP tandem fluorescent protein with organelle specific targeting sequences  it can be used to measure a wide range of substrates of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Spautin-A41 Attenuates Cerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis through Inhibition of Dysregulated Autophagy.Autophagy plays key roles in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the regulation of impaired autophagy has therapeutic potential. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of autophagy could ameliorate AP in mice and examine the underlying mechanisms. In current study  by imaging-based high-throughput screening  a novel spautin-1 derivative spautin-A41 was identified as a potent autophagy inhibitor. Mice treated with spautin-A41 were resistant to the cerulein-induced elevation of serum pancreatic enzyme activities and pancreatic apoptosis. Mechanistically  spautin-A41 effectively reduced the expression levels of Class III phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase complexes and subsequently ameliorated pancreatitis by inhibiting the formation of autophagosome. Therefore  pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by spautin-A41 may serve as new target for treating or lessening the severity of AP.,Autophagy_notLIR
DUSP1 overexpression attenuates renal tubular mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring Parkin-mediated mitophagy in diabetic nephropathy.Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease  and renal tubular cell dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of many kidney diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) reduced hyperglycemia-mediated mitochondrial damage; however  its role in hyperglycemia-driven dysfunction of tubular cells is still not fully understood. In this study  we found that DUSP1 is reduced in human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells under high-glucose conditions. DUSP1 overexpression in HK-2 cells partially restored autophagic flux  improved mitochondrial function  and reduced reactive oxygen species generation and cell apoptosis under high-glucose conditions. Surprisingly  overexpressing DUSP1 abolished the decrease in mitochondrial parkin expression caused by high-glucose stimulation. In addition  knockdown of parkin in HK-2 cells reversed the effects of DUSP1 overexpression on mitophagy and apoptosis under high-glucose conditions. Overall  these data indicate that DUSP1 plays a defensive role in the pathogenesis of DN by restoring parkin-mediated mitophagy  suggesting that it may be considered a prospective therapeutic strategy for the amelioration of DN.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genome-Wide Identification of Autophagy Prognostic Signature in Pancreatic Cancer.Autophagy plays a vital role in cancer development.

Cloud hunting: doryphagy  a form of selective autophagy that degrades centriolar satellites.The selective clearance of cellular components by macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In this punctum  we summarize and discuss our recent findings regarding a novel type of selective autophagy that targets centriolar satellites (CS) for degradation  a process we termed doryphagy from the Greek word "doryphoros"  standing for "satellite". CS are microtubule-associated protein complexes that regulate centrosome composition. We show that CS degradation is mediated through a direct interaction between GABARAPs and an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif in the CS protein PCM1. Autophagy-deficient systems accumulate large abnormal CS and consequently display centrosome reorganization and abnormal mitoses. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between autophagy deficiency and centrosome abnormalities and exemplify how mammalian Atg8-family proteins (mATG8s) can regulate substrate specificity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting HPV-16 antigens to the endoplasmic reticulum induces an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.Very promising results have been observed with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine based on human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) antigen retention and delivery system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However  the mechanism by which these antigens are processed once they reach this organelle is still unknown. Therefore  we evaluated whether this system awakens a stress response in the ER. Different DNA constructs based on E6 and E7 mutant antigens fused to an ER signal peptide (SP)  a signal for retention in the ER (KDEL)  or both signals (SPK)  were transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of E6 and E7 antigens targeted to the ER (SP  and SPK constructs) induced ER stress  which was indicated by an increase of the ER-stress markers GRP78/BiP and CHOP. Additionally  the ER stress response was mediated by the ATF4 transcription factor  which was translocated into the nucleus. Besides  the overexpressed antigens were degraded by the proteasome. Through a cycloheximide-chase assay  we demonstrated that when both protein synthesis and proteasome were inhibited  the overexpressed antigens were degraded. Interestingly  when proteasome was blocked autophagy was increased and the ER stress response decreased. Taken together  these results indicate that the antigens are initially degraded by the ERAD pathway  and autophagy degradation pathway can be induced to compensate the proteasome inhibition. Therefore  we provided a new insight into the mechanism by which E6 and E7 mutant antigens are processed once they reach the ER  which will help to improve the development of more effective vaccines against cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Polyphenol-Mediated Autophagy in Cancer: Evidence of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.One of the hallmarks of cellular transformation is the altered mechanism of cell death. There are three main types of cell death  characterized by different morphological and biochemical features  namely apoptosis (type I)  autophagic cell death (type II) and necrosis (type III). Autophagy  or self-eating  is a tightly regulated process involved in stress responses  and it is a lysosomal degradation process. The role of autophagy in cancer is controversial and has been associated with both the induction and the inhibition of tumor growth. Autophagy can exert tumor suppression through the degradation of oncogenic proteins  suppression of inflammation  chronic tissue damage and ultimately by preventing mutations and genetic instability. On the other hand  tumor cells activate autophagy for survival in cellular stress conditions. Thus  autophagy modulation could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. Several studies have shown that polyphenols  natural compounds found in foods and beverages of plant origin  can efficiently modulate autophagy in several types of cancer. In this review  we summarize the current knowledge on the effects of polyphenols on autophagy  highlighting the conceptual benefits or drawbacks and subtle cell-specific effects of polyphenols for envisioning future therapies employing polyphenols as chemoadjuvants.,Autophagy_notLIR
DNA methyltransferase-1 inactivation of androgen receptor axis triggers homocysteine induced cardiac fibroblast autophagy in diabetic cardiac fibrosis.Diabetic cardiac fibrosis is one of the main pathological manifestations of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac fibroblast autophagy plays critical roles in diabetic cardiac fibrosis  however  the underlying mechanism of cardiac fibroblast autophagy and diabetic cardiac fibrosis still largely unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanism of DNMT1 mediated DNA methylation alterations control cardiac fibroblast autophagy in diabetic cardiac fibrosis. We employed streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rats DCM  DCM patient and Hcy induced cardiac fibroblast autophagy. Heart tissue sections were stained with H&E  Sirius Red and Masson's trichrome stain. The expression of DNMT1  AR  Collagen genes mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR. MSP and BSP detected the methylation status of the AR promoter. The expression of DNMT1  AR  Collagen and autophagy-related proteins were detected by Western blotting  Immunofluorescence  Immunohistochemistry. Gain and loss function of AR and DNMT1 in cardiac fibroblast was analyzed. DNMT1 inhibition or knockdown elevated the expression of AR in cardiac fibroblast. Furthermore  we found that AR negatively regulation of Hcy induced cardiac fibroblast autophagy. We demonstrated that DNMT1 enhances cardiac fibroblast autophagy in diabetic cardiac fibrosis through inhibiting AR axis. In conclusion  our results provide new insight into the DNMT1 inactivation of AR axis triggers cardiac fibroblast autophagy in diabetic cardiac fibrosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
lncRNA MALAT1 participates in metformin inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cell.In recent years  the repurposing of conventional and chemotherapeutic drugs is recognized as an alternative strategy for health care. The main purpose of this study is to strengthen the application of non-oncological drug metformin on breast cancer treatment in the perspective of epigenetics. In the present study  metformin was found to inhibit cell proliferation  promote apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells at a dose-dependent manner. In addition  metformin treatment elevated acH3K9 abundance and decreased acH3K18 level. The expression of lncRNA MALAT1  HOTAIR  DICER1-AS1  LINC01121 and TUG1 was up-regulated by metformin treatment. In metformin-treated cells  MALAT1 knock-down increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and enhanced p21 but decreased cyclin B1 expression. The expression of Beclin1  VDAC1  LC3-II  CHOP and Bip was promoted in the cells received combinatorial treatment of metformin and MALAT1 knock-down. The reduced phosphorylation of c-Myc was further decreased in the metformin-treated cells in combination with MALAT1 knock-down than metformin treatment alone. Taken together  these results provide a promising repurposed strategy for metformin on cancer treatment by modulating epigenetic modifiers.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by ammonium chloride induced apoptosis and autophagy in MAC-T cell.Ammonia is a harmful gas with a pungent odor  participates in the regulation of a variety of apoptosis and autophagy  which in turn affects the growth and differentiation of cells. To test the regulation of NH<sub>3</sub> on the apoptosis and autophagy of mammary epithelial cells  we selected NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as NH<sub>3</sub> donor in vitro model. MTT and CCK-8 assay kits were employed to detect cell activity. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot methods were used to detect the abundance of inflammatory molecules  apoptosis markers  and autophagy genes. We selected TUNEL kit and the Annexin-FITC/PI method to detect apoptosis. TEM analysis was used to detect autophagic vesicles  and MDC stain evaluated the formation of autophagosome. The results indicated that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and promoted cell inflammatory response  apoptosis  and autophagy. NH<sub>4</sub>Cl stimulation notable increased the autophagosomes number. Interestingly  we also detected that the addition of LY294002 and Rapamycin inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway and the mTOR pathway  respectively  resulting in changes in both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore  we draw a conclusion that NH<sub>3</sub> may regulate the apoptosis and autophagic response of bovine mammary epithelial cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Further investigations on ammonia's function in other physiological respects  will be critical to provide theoretical help for the improvement of production performance. It will be also helpful for controlling the harmful gas ammonia concentration in the livestock house to protect the health of dairy cows.,Autophagy_notLIR

Short-Term Fever-Range Hyperthermia Accelerates NETosis and Reduces Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Secretion by Human Neutrophils.Fever is a hallmark of infections and inflammatory diseases  represented by an increase of 1-4°C in core body temperature. Fever-range hyperthermia (FRH) has been shown to increase neutrophil recruitment to local sites of infection. Here  we evaluated the impact of a short period (1 h) of FRH (STFRH) on pro-inflammatory and bactericidal human neutrophil functions. STFRH did not affect neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis but reverted the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anti-apoptotic effect compared with that under normothermic conditions. Furthermore  STFRH accelerated phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced NETosis evaluated either by the nuclear DNA decondensation at 2 h post-stimulation or by the increase in extracellular DNA that colocalized with myeloperoxidase (MPO) at 4 h post-stimulation. Increased NETosis upon STFRH was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but not in autophagy levels. STFRH also increased NETosis in response to <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> challenge but moderately reduced its phagocytosis. However  these STFRH-induced effects did not influence the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria after 4 h of co-culture. STFRH also significantly reduced neutrophil capacity to release the pro-inflammatory cytokines chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8/interleukin 8 (CXCL8/IL-8) and IL-1β in response to LPS and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> challenge. Altogether  these results indicate that a short and mild hyperthermal period is enough to modulate neutrophil responses to bacterial encounter. They also suggest that fever spikes during bacterial infections might lead neutrophils to trigger an emergency response promoting neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation to ensnare bacteria in order to wall off the infection and to reduce their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to limit the inflammatory response.,Autophagy_notLIR
TLR9 and beclin 1 crosstalk regulates muscle AMPK activation in exercise.The activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle coordinates systemic metabolic responses to exercise<sup>1</sup>. Autophagy-a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis<sup>2</sup>-is upregulated during exercise  and a core autophagy protein  beclin 1  is required for AMPK activation in skeletal muscle<sup>3</sup>. Here we describe a role for the innate immune-sensing molecule Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)<sup>4</sup>  and its interaction with beclin 1  in exercise-induced activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Mice that lack TLR9 are deficient in both exercise-induced activation of AMPK and plasma membrane localization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle  but are not deficient in autophagy. TLR9 binds beclin 1  and this interaction is increased by energy stress (glucose starvation and endurance exercise) and decreased by a BCL2 mutation<sup>3 5</sup> that blocks the disruption of BCL2-beclin 1 binding. TLR9 regulates the assembly of the endolysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C2)-which contains beclin 1 and UVRAG-in skeletal muscle during exercise  and knockout of beclin 1 or UVRAG inhibits the cellular AMPK activation induced by glucose starvation. Moreover  TLR9 functions in a muscle-autonomous fashion in ex vivo contraction-induced AMPK activation  glucose uptake and beclin 1-UVRAG complex assembly. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role for a Toll-like receptor in skeletal-muscle AMPK activation and glucose metabolism during exercise  as well as unexpected crosstalk between this innate immune sensor and autophagy proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nanotechnology-Based Targeting of mTOR Signaling in Cancer.Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism  which is activated in response to intra- and extracellular signals  including nutrients  growth factors  and cellular energy levels. The frequent dysregulation of mTOR signaling in cancer makes it an attractive therapeutic target  and several types of mTOR inhibitors have been developed. Nanoparticle-based mTOR modulators are predicted to target various cancers and deliver as well as release drugs in a controlled manner  resulting in enhanced bioavailability and reduced side effects. This mini-review is focused on the molecular mechanism of nanoparticle-based mTOR modulator action as well as the current development of mTOR inhibitors using nanoparticles. Understanding the biological function of nanoparticle-based mTOR modulators will contribute to the development of efficient nano-therapeutics for the treatment of cancers.,Autophagy_notLIR
No air without autophagy: autophagy is important for lung and swim bladder inflation.Macroautophagy is a catabolic process critical for the degradation of intracellular material  but its physiological functions in vertebrates are not fully understood. Here  we discuss our recent finding that macroautophagy plays a role in lamellar body maturation. The lamellar body is a lysosome-related organelle and stores phospholipid-containing surfactant complexes that reduce the surface tension of the air-water interface in order to inflate the airspace in lungs and swim bladders. In the epithelial cells of these organs  autophagosomes fuse with immature lamellar bodies to increase their size and lipid contents. This function is essential for respiration after birth in mice and for maintaining buoyancy in zebrafish. These findings unveil a novel function of macroautophagy in the maturation of surfactant-containing lamellar bodies.,Autophagy_notLIR
miR-27a ameliorates chemoresistance of breast cancer cells by disruption of reactive oxygen species homeostasis and impairment of autophagy.In patients with breast cancer  primary chemotherapy often fails due to survival of chemoresistant breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) which results in recurrence and metastasis of the tumor. However  the factors determining the chemoresistance of BCSCs have remained to be investigated. Here  we profiled a series of differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) between parental adherent breast cancer cells and BCSC-mimicking mammosphere-derived cancer cells  and identified hsa-miR-27a as a negative regulator for survival and chemoresistance of BCSCs. In the mammosphere  we found that the expression of hsa-miR-27a was downregulated  and ectopic overexpression of hsa-miR-27a reduced both number and size of mammospheres. In addition  overexpression of hsa-miR-27a sensitized breast cancer cells to anticancer drugs by downregulation of genes essential for detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairment of autophagy. Therefore  enhancing the hsa-miR-27a signaling pathway can be a potential therapeutic modality for breast cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Loss of HSPA9 induces peroxisomal degradation by increasing pexophagy.Quality control of peroxisomes is essential for cellular homeostasis. However  the mechanism underlying pexophagy is largely unknown. In this study  we identified HSPA9 as a novel pexophagy regulator. Downregulation of HSPA9 increased macroautophagy/autophagy but decreased the number of peroxisomes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The loss of peroxisomes by HSPA9 depletion was attenuated in SQSTM1-deficient cells. In HSPA9-deficient cells  the level of peroxisomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased  while inhibition of ROS blocked pexophagy in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly  reconstitution of HSPA9 mutants found in Parkinson disease failed to rescue the loss of peroxisomes  whereas reconstitution with wild type inhibited pexophagy in HSPA9-depleted cells. Knockdown of Hsc70-5 decreased peroxisomes in <i>Drosophila</i>  and the HSPA9 mutants failed to rescue the loss of peroxisomes in Hsc70-5-depleted flies. Taken together  our findings suggest that the loss of HSPA9 enhances peroxisomal degradation by pexophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
SPHK1-induced autophagy in peritoneal mesothelial cell enhances gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination.Gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination (GCPD) has been recognized as the most common form of metastasis in advanced gastric cancer (GC)  and the survival is pessimistic. The injury of mesothelial cells plays an important role in GCPD. However  its molecular mechanism is not entirely clear. Here  we focused on the sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) which regulates HPMCs autophagy in GCPD progression. Initially  we analyzed SPHK1 expression immunohistochemically in 120 GC peritoneal tissues  and found high SPHK1 expression to be significantly associated with LC3B expression and peritoneal recurrence  leading to poor prognosis. Using a coculture system  we observed that GC cells promoted HPMCs autophagy and this process was inhibited by blocking TGF-β1 secreted from GC cells. Autophagic HPMCs induced adhesion and invasion of GC cells. We also confirmed that knockdown of SPHK1 expression in HPMCs inhibited TGF-β1-induced autophagy. In addition  SPHK1-driven autophagy of HPMCs accelerated GC cells occurrence of GCPD in vitro and in vivo. Moreover  we explored the relationship between autophagy and fibrosis in HPMCs  observing that overexpression of SPHK1 induced HPMCs fibrosis  while the inhibition of autophagy weakened HPMCs fibrosis. Taken together  our results provided new insights for understanding the mechanisms of GCPD and established SPHK1 as a novel target for GCPD.,Autophagy_notLIR

Distinguishing Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Biochemical Phenotype Analysis Using a Novel Serum Profiling Platform: Potential Involvement of the VWF/ADAMTS13 Axis.It is important to develop minimally invasive biomarker platforms to help in the identification and monitoring of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Assisting in the understanding of biochemical mechanisms as well as identifying potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets would be an added benefit of such platforms. This study utilizes a simplified and novel serum profiling platform  using mass spectrometry (MS)  to help distinguish AD patient groups (mild and moderate) and controls  as well as to aid in understanding of biochemical phenotypes and possible disease development. A comparison of discriminating sera mass peaks between AD patients and control individuals was performed using leave one [serum sample] out cross validation (LOOCV) combined with a novel peak classification valuation (PCV) procedure. LOOCV/PCV was able to distinguish significant sera mass peak differences between a group of mild AD patients and control individuals with a <i>p</i> value of 10<sup>-13</sup>. This value became non-significant (<i>p</i> = 0.09) when the same sera samples were randomly allocated between the two groups and reanalyzed by LOOCV/PCV. This is indicative of physiological group differences in the original true-pathology binary group comparison. Similarities and differences between AD patients and traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients were also discernable using this novel LOOCV/PCV platform. MS/MS peptide analysis was performed on serum mass peaks comparing mild AD patients with control individuals. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that cell pathways/biochemical phenotypes affected in AD include those involving neuronal cell death  vasculature  neurogenesis  and AD/dementia/amyloidosis. Inflammation  autoimmunity  autophagy  and blood-brain barrier pathways also appear to be relevant to AD. An impaired VWF/ADAMTS13 vasculature axis with connections to F8 (factor VIII) and LRP1 and NOTCH1 was indicated and is proposed to be important in AD development.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of the LncRNA-FA2H-2-MLKL pathway in atherosclerosis by regulation of autophagy flux and inflammation through mTOR-dependent signaling.Atherosclerosis is a progressive  chronic inflammation in arterial walls. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in inflammation  but the exact mechanism in atherosclerosis is unclear. Our microarray analyses revealed that the levels of lncRNA-FA2H-2 were significantly decreased by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL). Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) might be regulated by lncRNA-FA2H-2. In vitro experiments showed that lncRNA-FA2H-2 interacted with the promoter of the MLKL gene  downregulated MLKL expression  and the binding sites between -750 and 471 were necessary for lncRNA-FA2H-2 responsiveness to MLKL. Silencing lncRNA-FA2H-2 and overexpression of MLKL could activate inflammation and inhibited autophagy flux. Both lncRNA-FA2H-2 knockdown and overexpression of MLKL could significantly aggravate inflammatory responses induced by OX-LDL. We found that the 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Atg7-shRNA enhanced inflammatory responses induced by knockdown of lncRNA-FA2H-2 and overexpression of MLKL. We demonstrated that the effects of MLKL on autophagy might be associated with a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling pathways. In vivo experiments with apoE knockout mice fed a western diet demonstrated that LncRNA-FA2H-2 knockdown decreased microtubule-associated expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1  but increased expression of sequestosome 1 (p62)  MLKL  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1  and interleukin-6 in atherosclerotic lesions. Our findings indicated that the lncRNA-FA2H-2-MLKL pathway is essential for regulation of autophagy and inflammation  and suggested that lncRNA-FA2H-2 and MLKL could act as potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate atherosclerosis-related diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting liver cancer stem cells for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and prognosis remains poor. It has been increasingly recognized that liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are responsible for the carcinogenesis  recurrence  metastasis and chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Targeting LCSCs is promising to be a new direction for the treatment of HCC. Herein  we summarize the potentially therapeutic targets in LCSCs at the level of genes  molecules and cells  such as knockout of oncogenes or oncoproteins  restoring the silent tumor suppressor genes  inhibition of the transcription factors and regulation of noncoding RNAs (including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs) in LCSCs at the genetic level; inhibition of markers and blockade of the key signaling pathways of LCSCs at the molecular level; and inhibiting autophagy and application of oncolytic adenoviruses in LCSCs at the cellular level. Moreover  we analyze the potential targets in LCSCs to eliminate chemoresistance of HCC. Thereinto  the suppression of autophagy and Nanog by chloroquine and shRNA respectively may be the most promising targeting approaches. These targets may provide novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC by targeting LCSCs.,Autophagy_notLIR

High-throughput screening of functional deubiquitinating enzymes in autophagy.Macroautophagy/autophagy  a eukaryotic homeostatic process that sequesters cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation  is orchestrated by a number of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins tightly controlled by post-translational modifications. However  the involvement of reversible ubiquitination in the regulation of autophagy remains largely unclear. Here  we performed a single-guide RNA-based screening assay to investigate the functions of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in regulating autophagy. We identified previously unrecognized roles of several DUBs in modulating autophagy at multiple levels by targeting various ATG proteins. Mechanistically  we demonstrated that STAMBP/AMSH (STAM-binding protein) promotes the stabilization of ULK1 by removing its lysine 48 (K48)-linked ubiquitination  whereas OTUD7B mediates the degradation of PIK3 C3 by enhancing its K48-linked ubiquitination  thus positively or negatively affects autophagy flux  respectively. Together  our study elaborated on the broad involvement of DUBs in regulating autophagy and uncovered the critical roles of the reversible ubiquitination in the modification of ATG proteins.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related; Baf A<sub>1</sub>: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; DUB: deubiquitinating enzyme; EBSS: Earle's balanced salt solution; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; OTUD7B: OTU domain-containing protein 7B; PIK3C3: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; sgRNA: single-guide RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; STAMBP/AMSH: STAM-binding protein; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; USP: ubiquitin specific peptidase.,Autophagy_notLIR
[HuArgI (co)-PEG5000]-induced arginine deprivation leads to autophagy dependent cell death in pancreatic cancer cells.In this study  we examined the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to [HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000]-induced arginine deprivation as well as the mechanisms underlying deprivation-induced cell death. [HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000]-induced arginine deprivation was cytotoxic to all cell lines tested with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the pM range at 72 h post-treatment. Three of the five cell lines were rescued by the addition of excess L-citrulline and expressed ASS1  indicating partial arginine auxotrophy. The remaining two cell lines  on the other hand  were not rescued by the addition of L-citrulline and did not express ASS1  indicating complete auxotrophy to arginine. In addition  all cell lines exhibited G0/G1 cell cycle arrest  in the surviving cell fraction  at 72 h following arginine deprivation. Analysis of the type of cell death revealed negative staining for annexin V and a lack of caspase activation in all five cancer cell lines  following treatment  indicating that arginine deprivation leads to caspase-independent  non-apoptotic cell death. Finally  we demonstrated that arginine deprivation leads to a marked activation of autophagy and that inhibition of this autophagy greatly decreases cytotoxicity  indicating that arginine deprivation induces autophagic cell death in pancreatic cancer cells. We have shown that pancreatic cancer cells are auxotrophic for arginine and sensitive to [HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000]-induced arginine deprivation  hence demonstrating that arginine deprivation is a potentially potent and selective treatment for pancreatic cancer. We have also demonstrated that autophagy is activated following arginine-deprivation and that its prolonged activation leads to autophagic cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR

Synthesis and biological activity of Ub2 derived peptides as potential host-directed antitubercular therapy.The correlation of mycobactericidal property of macrophages with its potential to deliver bacteria to hydrolytic lysosomes  augmented with ubiquitin-derived peptides (Ub2)  activates the process of autophagy. This leads to the formation of phagolysosomes supported by factor involving increased cationic charges which regulate the acidic pH causing elimination of Mycobacterium. To better understand this interaction of cationic-rich ubiquitin-derived peptides with mycobacteria and to identify putative mycobacterial intrinsic resistance mechanisms for phagolysosome formation  we have synthesized a new series of Ub2 peptides  wherein the Gly residues are replaced with azaGly with the aim to improve metabolic stability. In addition to that a new methodology is reported for the synthesis of heteroaryl tethered peptides using azaGly as a linker. We have demonstrated that positive puncta (directly proportional to the acidification of lysosome) in cytosol was significantly increased after 6 hours on the treatment of macrophage with Ub2 peptide derivatives (1  6  10  and 11) causing the higher intensity of lysosome observed through LysoTracker Red Dye. The circular dichroism spectral studies are carried out in water and water:TFE mixture and demonstrated that the Ub2 peptides have helix-forming tendency in the presence of TFE. The recognizable intracellular killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Ub2 peptides provides a new approach for host-directed therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Prognostic and Immunological Role of FUN14 Domain Containing 1 in Pan-Cancer: Friend or Foe?<b>Background:</b> FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy)  which is closely associated with human immunity. However  the role of FUNDC1 in cancers remains unclear. This study aimed to visualize the prognostic landscape of FUNDC1 in pan-cancer and investigate the relationship between FUNDC1 expression and immune infiltration. <b>Methods:</b> In this study  we explored the expression pattern and prognostic value of FUNDC1 in pan-cancer across multiple databases  including ONCOMINE  PrognoScan  GEPIA  and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Then  using the GEPIA and TIMER databases  we investigated the correlations between FUNDC1 expression and immune infiltration in cancers  especially liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC)  and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). <b>Results:</b> In general  compared with that in normal tissue  tumor tissue had a higher expression level of FUNDC1. Although FUNDC1 showed a protective effect on pan-cancer  a high expression level of FUNDC1 was detrimental to the survival of LIHC patients. Although different from what was found for LUSC  for LIHC  there were significant positive correlations between FUNDC1 expression and immune infiltrates  including B cells  CD8+ T cells  CD4+ T cells  neutrophils  macrophages  and dendritic cells. Furthermore  markers of infiltrating immune cells  such as tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs)  exhibited different FUNDC1-related immune infiltration patterns. <b>Conclusion:</b> The mitophagy regulator FUNDC1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker in pan-cancer and is correlated with immune infiltrates.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transcriptional Plasticity of Autophagy-Related Genes Correlates with the Genetic Response to Nitrate Starvation in <i>Arabidopsis Thaliana</i>.In eukaryotes  autophagy  a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling  allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. For a better understanding of the relationship between autophagy and nitrogen metabolism  we studied the transcriptional plasticity of autophagy genes (<i>ATG</i>) in nine Arabidopsis accessions grown under normal and nitrate starvation conditions. The status of the N metabolism in accessions was monitored by measuring the relative expression of 11 genes related to N metabolism in rosette leaves. The transcriptional variation of the genes coding for enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation characterize the genetic diversity of the response to nitrate starvation. Starvation enhanced the expression of most of the autophagy genes tested  suggesting a control of autophagy at transcriptomic level by nitrogen. The diversity of the gene responses among natural accessions revealed the genetic variation existing for autophagy independently of the nutritive condition  and the degree of response to nitrate starvation. We showed here that the genetic diversity of the expression of N metabolism genes correlates with that of the <i>ATG</i> genes in the two nutritive conditions  suggesting that the basal autophagy activity is part of the integral response of the N metabolism to nitrate availability.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitigation of ALS Pathology by Neuron-Specific Inhibition of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Signaling.To investigate the role of neuronal NF-κB activity in pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  we generated transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of a super-repressor form of the NF-κB inhibitor (IκBα-SR)  which were then crossed with mice of both sexes  expressing ALS-linked gene mutants for TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Remarkably  neuronal expression of IκBα-SR transgene in mice expressing TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> or TDP-43<sup>G348C</sup> mice led to a decrease in cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of human TDP-43. The mitigation of TDP-43 neuropathology by IκBα-SR  which is likely due to an induction of autophagy  was associated with amelioration of cognitive and motor deficits as well as reduction of motor neuron loss and gliosis. Neuronal suppression of NF-κB activity in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice also resulted in neuroprotection with reduction of misfolded SOD1 levels and significant extension of life span. The results suggest that neuronal NF-κB signaling constitutes a novel therapeutic target for ALS disease and related disorders with TDP-43 proteinopathy.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study reports that neuron-specific expression of IκB super-repressor mitigated behavioral and pathologic changes in transgenic mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis expressing mutant forms of either Tar DNA-binding protein 43 or superoxide dismutase. The results suggest that neuronal NF-κB signaling constitutes a novel therapeutic target for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related disorders with Tar DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oxygen partial pressure plays a crucial role in B16 melanoma cell survival by regulating autophagy and mitochondrial functions.The oxygen partial pressure generally increases when cancerous cells become part of the blood vessels. The study was to investigate the influence of oxygen partial pressure on the apoptosis of B16 melanoma cells. Our results demonstrated that both short-term and long-term hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment increased stress-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). H/R treatment also increased apoptosis and autophagy in B16 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC)  a ROS scavenger  can reduce ROS and aid survival. However  Bafilomycin A1  an autophagy inhibitor  can accelerate cell death. Thus  our work revealed that ROS and autophagy play critical roles in cellular H/R.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nrf2 and SQSTM1/p62 jointly contribute to mesenchymal transition and invasion in glioblastoma.Accumulating evidence suggests that constitutively active Nrf2 has a pivotal role in cancer as it induces pro-survival genes that promote cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. The mechanisms of Nrf2 dysregulation and functions in cancer have not been fully characterized. Here  we jointly analyzed the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data in order to identify cancer types where Nrf2 activation is present. We found that Nrf2 is hyperactivated in a subset of glioblastoma (GBM) patients  whose tumors display a mesenchymal subtype  and uncover several different mechanisms contributing to increased Nrf2 activity. Importantly  we identified a positive feedback loop between SQSTM1/p62 and Nrf2 as a mechanism for activation of the Nrf2 pathway. We also show that autophagy and serine/threonine signaling regulates p62 mediated Keap1 degradation. Our results in glioma cell lines indicate that both Nrf2 and p62 promote proliferation  invasion and mesenchymal transition. Finally  Nrf2 activity was associated with decreased progression free survival in TCGA GBM patient samples  suggesting that treatments have limited efficacy if this transcription factor is overactivated. Overall  our findings place Nrf2 and p62 as the key components of the mesenchymal subtype network  with implications to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Thus  Nrf2 activation could be used as a surrogate prognostic marker in mesenchymal subtype GBMs. Furthermore  strategies aiming at either inhibiting Nrf2 or exploiting Nrf2 hyperactivity for targeted gene therapy may provide novel treatment options for this subset of GBM.,Autophagy_notLIR

Yunpi Heluo decoction attenuates insulin resistance by regulating SIRT1-FoxO1 autophagy pathway in skeletal muscle of Zucker diabetic fatty rats.Diabetes is a serious chronic metabolic disorder  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes cases. Insulin resistance (IR) is an early symptom  typical feature and main pathogenesis of T2DM due to the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors. Current evidence shows that IR is mainly caused by nutrient overload  systemic fatty acid excess  fatty tissue inflammation  endoplasmic reticulum stress  oxidative stress and abnormal autophagy. Autophagy plays an important role in the development of IR and decreased autophagy activity can cause IR through various ways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Development of a pH-responsive polymersome inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy blockade.Autophagy is involved in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here  a pH-responsive polymersome codelivering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and tunicamycin (Tuni) drugs is developed to simultaneously induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagic flux blockade for achieving an antitumor effect and inhibiting tumor metastasis. The pH response of poly(β-amino ester) and HCQ synergistically deacidifies the lysosomes  thereby blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and lastly blocking autophagic flux. The function mechanism of regulating autophagy was systematically investigated on orthotopic luciferase gene-transfected  4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice through Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The Tuni triggers ER stress to regulate the PERK/Akt signaling pathway to increase the autophagic level. The "autophagic stress" generated by triggering ER stress-induced autophagy and blocking autophagic flux is effective against tumors. The reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 due to ER stress and reduced focal adhesions turnover due to the blockade of autophagic flux synergistically inhibit tumor metastasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Blockage of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Exerts an Antitumor Effect via Regulating Energy Metabolism and Enhances the Efficacy of Autophagy Inhibitors by Regulating Transcription Factor EB Nuclear Translocation in Osteosarcoma.Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a valuable target molecule for cancer. However  antitumor drugs targeting ERK are still in their clinical phase and no FDA-approved medications exist. In this study  we identified an ERK inhibitor (ERKi; Vx-11e) with potential antitumor activities  which was reflected by the inhibition in the survival and proliferation of Osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Mechanistically  the ERKi regulated autophagic flux by promoting the translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in OS cells  thereby increasing the dependence of OS cells on autophagy and sensitivity to treatment with autophagy inhibitors in OS. Besides  we also found that the ERKi could regulate mitochondrial apoptosis through the ROS/mitochondria pathway and aerobic glycolysis in OS  which also increases the dependence of OS cells on autophagy to clear metabolites to a certain extent. These results may provide a reference for the clinically improved efficacy of ERKis in combination with autophagy inhibitors in the treatment of OS and indicate its potential as a therapeutic agent.,Autophagy_notLIR
Modulation of autophagy by the novel mitochondrial complex I inhibitor Authipyrin.Autophagy ensures cellular homeostasis by the degradation of long-lived proteins  damaged organelles and pathogens. This catabolic process provides essential cellular building blocks upon nutrient deprivation. Cellular metabolism  especially mitochondrial respiration  has a significant influence on autophagic flux  and complex I function is required for maximal autophagy. In Parkinson's disease mitochondrial function is frequently impaired and autophagic flux is altered. Thus  dysfunctional organelles and protein aggregates accumulate and cause cellular damage. In order to investigate the interdependency between mitochondrial function and autophagy  novel tool compounds are required. Herein  we report the discovery of a structurally novel autophagy inhibitor (Authipyrin) using a high content screening approach. Target identification and validation led to the discovery that Authipyrin targets mitochondrial complex I directly  leading to the potent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration as well as autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tenovin-6 induces the SIRT-independent cell growth suppression and blocks autophagy flux in canine hemangiosarcoma cell lines.Canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is a commonly occurring aggressive tumor stemming from the vascular endothelial cells and is considered to be a good model for a similar disease in humans  called angiosarcoma. In this study  we reviewed drug libraries to identify new signal transduction inhibitors that can suppress the cell growth of canine HSA in vitro. We observed that tenovin-6  a sirtuin (SIRT) inhibitor  inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in three canine HSA cell lines (JuB4  Re12  and Ud6). These effects were induced through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-3 activation. Although tenovin-6 is known as an inhibitor of SIRT1 and SIRT2  knockout (KO) of genes encoding SIRT1 and/or SIRT2 had no apparent impact on cell proliferation in canine HSA. In addition  tenovin-6 showed cell growth inhibition in SIRT KO cells  as well as parental cells. These results indicated the cytotoxicity of tenovin-6 was a SIRT-independent event. Instead  we found that tenovin-6 inhibited autophagy flux in canine HSA cells  as evidenced by the suppression of lysosomal proteolysis. These results suggested that tenovin-6 induces cell growth suppression in canine HSA cells by impairing the lysosomal function. Therefore  tenovin-6 could be used in a new therapeutic strategy to treat canine HSA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydrogen sulfide-induced GAPDH sulfhydration disrupts the CCAR2-SIRT1 interaction to initiate autophagy.The deacetylase SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) has emerged as a major regulator of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of macroautophagy/autophagy marker MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3). Activation of SIRT1 leads to the deacetylation of LC3 and its translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm leading to an increase in the autophagy flux. Notably  hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a cytoprotective gasotransmitter known to activate SIRT1 and autophagy; however  the underlying mechanism for both remains unknown. Herein  we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>S sulfhydrates the active site cysteine of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Sulfhydration of GAPDH leads to its redistribution into the nucleus. Importantly  nuclear localization of GAPDH is critical for H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated activation of autophagy as H<sub>2</sub>S does not induce autophagy in cells with GAPDH ablation or cells overexpressing a GAPDH mutant lacking the active site cysteine. Importantly  we observed that nuclear GAPDH interacts with CCAR2/DBC1 (cell cycle activator a nd apoptosis regulator 2) inside the nucleus. CCAR2 interacts with the deacetylase SIRT1 to inhibit its activity. Interaction of GAPDH with CCAR2 disrupts the inhibitory effect of CCAR2 on SIRT1. Activated SIRT1 then deacetylates MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) to induce its translocation into the cytoplasm and activate autophagy. Additionally  we demonstrate this pathway's physiological role in autophagy-mediated trafficking of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> into lysosomes to restrict intracellular mycobacteria growth. We think that the pathway described here could be involved in H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated clearance of intracellular pathogens and other health benefits.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BECN1: beclin 1  autophagy related; CCAR2/DBC1: cell cycle activator and apoptosis regulator 2; CFU: colony-forming units; DLG4/PSD95: discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 4; EX-527: 6-chloro-2 3 4 9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H<sub>2</sub>S: hydrogen sulfide; HEK: human embryonic kidney cells; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; <i>Mtb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MOI: multiplicity of infection; NO: nitric oxide; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-4 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; PLA: proximity ligation assay; PRKAA: protein kinase  AMP-activated  alpha catalytic subunit; SIAH1: siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1A; SIRT1: sirtuin 1; TB: tuberculosis; TP53INP2/DOR: transformation related protein 53 inducible nuclear protein 2; TRP53/TP53: transformation related protein 53.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Selective Autophagy Receptors.Selective autophagy enables degradation of specific cargo such as protein aggregates or organelles and thus plays an essential role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. Cargo specificity is achieved on the level of autophagy receptors that concurrently bind the cargo and the autophagosomal membrane. Recent studies have demonstrated that selective autophagy is tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications of autophagy receptors  in particular protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of autophagy receptors by different kinases  including Tank-binding kinase (TBK1)  can increase their affinity toward the cargo or autophagosomes and thereby regulate the specificity and activity of selective autophagy depending on the cellular condition.Here  we report an approach for quantitative analysis of phosphorylation sites on autophagy receptors using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In this protocol  GFP-tagged autophagy receptors are purified based on the high-affinity binding between GFP and GFP-Trap agarose. Interaction partners and background binders are subsequently removed by washes under denaturing conditions to obtain a pure fraction of the bait protein  thereby reducing the complexity of the analyzed sample. The bait protein is then digested on-bead  and peptides are analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The described approach permits systematic identification and quantification of phosphorylation sites on autophagy receptors and other autophagic components. In addition to phosphorylation  this protocol is suitable for investigating other posttranslational modifications  including protein ubiquitylation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rapid Clathrin-Mediated Uptake of Recombinant α-Gal-A to Lysosome Activates Autophagy.Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A (rh-α-Gal A) is the standard treatment for Fabry disease (FD). ERT has shown a significant impact on patients; however  there is still morbidity and mortality in FD  resulting in progressive cardiac  renal  and cerebrovascular pathology. The main pathway for delivery of rh-α-Gal A to lysosome is cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) endocytosis  also known as insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) endocytosis. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms of uptake of rh-α-Gal-A in different cell types  with the exploration of clathrin-dependent and caveolin assisted receptor-mediated endocytosis and the dynamics of autophagy-lysosomal functions. rh-α-Gal-A uptake was evaluated in primary fibroblasts  urine originated kidney epithelial cells  and peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from Fabry patients and healthy controls  and in cell lines HEK293  HTP1  and HUVEC. Uptake of rh-α-Gal-A was more efficient in the cells with the lowest endogenous enzyme activity. Chloroquine and monensin significantly blocked the uptake of rh-α-Gal-A  indicating that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in recombinant enzyme delivery. Alternative caveolae-mediated endocytosis coexists with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However  clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a dominant mechanism for enzyme uptake in all cell lines. These results show that the uptake of rh-α-Gal-A occurs rapidly and activates the autophagy-lysosomal pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydroxytyrosol protects from aging process via AMPK and autophagy; a review of its effects on cancer  metabolic syndrome  osteoporosis  immune-mediated and neurodegenerative diseases.Aging is a complex process. It is considered a risk factor for several diseases such as cancer  neurodegenerative diseases  cardiovascular diseases  and diabetes  most of which have an oxidative and inflammatory base. Given that life expectancy is increasing  there is a present interest in the search for anti-aging strategies that allow a healthy aging. Interestingly  in Spain  where the Mediterranean Diet (MD) is the reference food pattern  life expectancy will have the highest average by 2040. This diet is characterized  among other items  by virgin olive oil intake  which contains between 50-200 mg/kg of hydroxytyrosol  a major polyphenolic component of olive oil. Hydroxytyrosol is formed by the hydrolysis of oleuropein during the maturing of olives  storage of olive oil  and preparation of table olives. It is a yield of oleuropein by microbiota action in the organism after virgin olive oil consumption. The daily intake in context of the MD is estimated to be around 0.15 and 30 mg/day. In the last few years  hydroxytyrosol has received increasing attention due to its multiple pharmacological activities  such as antioxidant  anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities. It has also been the focus of extensive research regarding its bioactivity. In this sense  hydroxytyrosol is under consideration for the development of new anti-aging strategies. In this review we will summarize the potential anti-aging effects of hydroxytyrosol and its protective role in several age-related diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of microRNA-21-5p reduces keloid fibroblast autophagy and migration by targeting PTEN after electron beam irradiation.Electron beam (EB) irradiation is useful to reduce the recurrence of keloids; however  the underlying mechanism remains unknown. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21)  which regulates autophagy during cancer radiation therapy  was identified as a potential therapeutic target for keloids. Here  we investigate the regulatory mechanism(s) of miR-21-5p on keloid fibroblast autophagy and migration after EB irradiation. The microRNA expression profile of the keloid dermis was examined by performing a microRNA microarray. Levels of LC3B and Beclin-1 were detected by immunohistochemical and western blot analysis in the keloid dermis and fibroblasts. Autophagy and apoptosis were tested in keloid fibroblasts after EB irradiation or transfection with an miR-21-5p inhibitor using electron microscopy  a Cyto-ID Green Autophagy Detection Kit  and an Annexin V PE Apoptosis Detection Kit. Migration was analyzed by an in vitro scratch-wound healing assay. Mechanistic tests were performed using small interfering RNAs to phosphatase and tensin homolog (siPTEN). Levels of miR-21-5p  PTEN  programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4)  p-AKT  and apoptosis- and autophagy-associated genes were examined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. LC3B expression and migration ability were enhanced in fibroblasts and the keloid margin dermis compared with those in the adjacent normal skin. Both EB irradiation and an miR-21-5p inhibitor reduced keloid fibroblast autophagy  which was accompanied by decreased expression of miR-21-5p  p-AKT  and LC3B-II and increased expression of PTEN  PDCD4  and apoptosis-related genes. MiR-21-5p downregulation inhibited migration and suppressed LC3B expression and this was reversed by PTEN reduction. In conclusion  with increasing apoptosis  EB irradiation inhibits autophagy in keloid fibroblasts by reducing miR-21-5p  which regulates migration and LC3B expression via PTEN/AKT signaling. These data suggest a potential mechanism wherein miR-21-5p inhibition regulates autophagy and migration in EB-irradiated keloid fibroblasts  effectively preventing local invasion and recurrence. Therefore  miR-21-5p could be a new therapeutic target  to replace EB irradiation  and control keloid relapse.,Autophagy_notLIR
miR-221/222-Mediated Inhibition of Autophagy Promotes Dexamethasone Resistance in Multiple Myeloma.Inherent or acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is still an obstacle for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). MicroRNA dysregulation is related to the development of chemoresistance in cancers. However  its role in chemoresistance of MM is largely unknown. Here we demonstrated that miR-221/222 were upregulated in plasma cells from patients with MM  especially those with relapsed or refractory disease. Moreover  expression levels of miR-221/222 were inversely correlated with dexamethasone (Dex) sensitivity of human MM cell lines. Importantly  we found that Dex induced pro-death autophagy in MM cells and the inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased Dex-induced cell death. Mechanistically  autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) was identified as a novel target gene of miR-221/222  and miR-221/222 overexpression inhibited autophagy by directly targeting ATG12 and the p27<sup>kip</sup> (p27)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Indeed  Dex treatment decreased the expression of miR-221/222  thereby activating the ATG12/p27-mTOR autophagy-regulatory axis and inducing cell death in Dex-sensitive MM cells. Furthermore  both in vitro and in vivo results showed that the inhibitions of miR-221/222 increased the expression of ATG12 and p27 and functionally induced extended autophagy and cell death of MM cells. In conclusion  our findings demonstrated the crucial role of the miR-221/222-ATG12/p27-mTOR autophagy-regulatory axis in Dex resistance of MM  and they suggest potential prediction and treatment strategies for glucocorticoid resistance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Evidence Linking Protein Misfolding to Quality Control in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases.Several proteolytic systems including ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS)  chaperonemediated autophagy (CMA)  and macroautophagy are used by the mammalian cells to remove misfolded proteins (MPs). UPS mediates degradation of most of the MPs  where Ub-conjugated substrates are deubiquitinated  unfolded  and passed through the proteasome's narrow chamber  and eventually break into smaller peptides. It has been observed that the substrates that show a specific degradation signal  the KFERQ sequence motif  can be delivered to and go through CMA-mediated degradation in lysosomes. Macroautophagy can help in the degradation of substrates that are prone to aggregation and resistant to both the CMA and UPS. In the aforesaid case  cargoes are separated into autophagosomes before lysosomal hydrolase-mediated degradation. Even though the majority of the aggregated and MPs in the human proteome can be removed via cellular protein quality control (PQC)  some mutant and native proteins tend to aggregate into β-sheet-rich oligomers that exhibit resistance to all identified proteolytic processes and can  therefore  grow into extracellular plaques or inclusion bodies. Indeed  the buildup of protease-resistant aggregated and MPs is a usual process underlying various protein misfolding disorders  including neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) for example Alzheimer's disease  Parkinson's disease  Huntington's disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and prion diseases. In this article  we have focused on the contribution of PQC in the degradation of pathogenic proteins in NDs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nontoxic concentration of ochratoxin A decreases the dosage of cyclosporine A to induce chronic nephropathy model via autophagy mediated by toll-like receptor 4.Cyclosporine A (CsA) extracted from the products of fungal fermentation is used to develop a chronic nephropathy model. However  it has numerous side effects. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin that induces renal injury. We developed a chronic nephropathy model to lessen the side effects of CsA by administration of nontoxic dosage of OTA  and investigated the underlying mechanism. C57BL/10 wild-type mice  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)<sup>-/-</sup> mice  and HK-2 cells were used in this study. The nontoxic dosage (0.25 mg/kg  qod) of OTA could significantly decrease the dosage of CsA from 30 to 20 mg/kg per day  and combination of them induced chronic nephropathy model and alleviated the side effects of onefold CsA in vivo  including cardiotoxicity  hepatotoxicity  and immunosuppression. The nontoxic concentration (0.5 μg/ml) of OTA could significantly decrease the concentration of CsA from 10 to 6 μg/ml that induced cytotoxicity  oxidative stress  and nephrotoxicity in vitro. Nontoxic concentration of OTA and low dosage of CsA activated TLR4 and autophagy. These toxic effects induced by OTA and CsA could be reversed by knockdown of TLR4 and autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine in vitro. Furthermore  the renal injury and autophagy induced by OTA and CsA could be attenuated in TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. It suggested that a chronic nephropathy model had been successfully developed by administration of nontoxic concentration of OTA and low dosage of CsA via TLR4-mediated autophagy. The side effects of current model were significantly lesser than those of the previous model induced by onefold CsA. It provided a new tool for exploring the pathogenesis and treatment of chronic kidney disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Progression-Mediated Changes in Mitochondrial Morphology Promotes Adaptation to Hypoxic Peritoneal Conditions in Serous Ovarian Cancer.Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer in women  with a survival rate of less than 30% when the cancer has spread throughout the peritoneal cavity. Aggregation of cancer cells increases their viability and metastatic potential; however  there are limited studies that correlate these functional changes to specific phenotypic alterations. In this study  we investigated changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics during malignant transition using our MOSE cell model for progressive serous ovarian cancer. Mitochondrial morphology was changed with increasing malignancy from a filamentous network to single  enlarged organelles due to an imbalance of mitochondrial dynamic proteins (fusion: MFN1/OPA1  fission: DRP1/FIS1). These phenotypic alterations aided the adaptation to hypoxia through the promotion of autophagy and were accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial ultrastructure  mitochondrial membrane potential  and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The tumor-initiating cells increased mitochondrial fragmentation after aggregation and exposure to hypoxia that correlated well with our previously observed reduced growth and respiration in spheroids  suggesting that these alterations promote viability in non-permissive conditions. Our identification of such mitochondrial phenotypic changes in malignancy provides a model in which to identify targets for interventions aimed at suppressing metastases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 provide multiple strategies for autophagy regulation.Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway essential for protein homeostasis  survival and development. Defects in autophagic pathways have been connected to a variety of human diseases  including cancer and neurodegeneration. In the process of macroautophagy  cytoplasmic cargo is enclosed in a double-membrane structure and fused to the lysosome to allow for digestion and recycling of material. Autophagosome formation is primed by the ULK complex  which enables the downstream production of PI(3)P  a key lipid signalling molecule  on the phagophore membrane. The PI(3)P is generated by the PI3 kinase (PI3K) complex  consisting of the core components VPS34  VPS15 and Beclin 1. Beclin 1 is a central player in autophagy and constitutes a molecular platform for the regulation of autophagosome formation and maturation. Post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 affect its stability  interactions and ability to regulate PI3K activity  providing the cell with a plethora of strategies to fine-tune the levels of autophagy. Being such an important regulator  Beclin 1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention and interfering with the post-translational regulation of Beclin 1 could be one way of manipulating the levels of autophagy. In this review  we provide an overview of the known post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 that govern its role in autophagy and how these modifications are maintained by input from several upstream signalling pathways. ▓.,Autophagy_notLIR
Image-Based Morphological Profiling Identifies a Lysosomotropic  Iron-Sequestering Autophagy Inhibitor.Chemical proteomics is widely applied in small-molecule target identification. However  in general it does not identify non-protein small-molecule targets  and thus  alternative methods for target identification are in high demand. We report the discovery of the autophagy inhibitor autoquin and the identification of its molecular mode of action using image-based morphological profiling in the cell painting assay. A compound-induced fingerprint representing changes in 579 cellular parameters revealed that autoquin accumulates in lysosomes and inhibits their fusion with autophagosomes. In addition  autoquin sequesters Fe<sup>2+</sup> in lysosomes  resulting in an increase of lysosomal reactive oxygen species and ultimately cell death. Such a mechanism of action would have been challenging to unravel by current methods. This work demonstrates the potential of the cell painting assay to deconvolute modes of action of small molecules  warranting wider application in chemical biology.,Autophagy_notLIR

Longevity in response to lowered insulin signaling requires glycine N-methyltransferase-dependent spermidine production.Reduced insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) extends lifespan in multiple organisms. Different processes in different tissues mediate this lifespan extension  with a set of interplays that remain unclear. We here show that  in Drosophila  reduced IIS activity modulates methionine metabolism  through tissue-specific regulation of glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt)  and that this regulation is required for full IIS-mediated longevity. Furthermore  fat body-specific expression of Gnmt was sufficient to extend lifespan. Targeted metabolomics showed that reducing IIS activity led to a Gnmt-dependent increase in spermidine levels. We also show that both spermidine treatment and reduced IIS activity are sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila  but only in the presence of Gnmt. This extension of lifespan was associated with increased levels of autophagy. Finally  we found that increased expression of Gnmt occurs in the liver of liver-specific IRS1 KO mice and is thus an evolutionarily conserved response to reduced IIS. The discovery of Gnmt and spermidine as tissue-specific modulators of IIS-mediated longevity may aid in developing future therapeutic treatments to ameliorate aging and prevent disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
ATG16L1 autophagy pathway regulates BAX protein levels and programmed cell death.Previously we reported that adipocyte SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) deficiency blocks the activation of macroautophagy  leading to an increased abundance of BAX  a pro-death Bcl-2 family member  and activation and adipocyte cell death both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Here  we found that knockdown of SNAP23 inhibited the association of the autophagosome regulators ATG16L1 and ATG9 compartments by nutrient depletion and reduced the formation of ATG16L1 membrane puncta. ATG16L1 knockdown inhibited autophagy flux and increased BAX protein levels by suppressing BAX degradation. The elevation in BAX protein had no effect on BAX activation or cell death in the nutrient-replete state. However  following nutrient depletion  BAX was activated with a concomitant induction of cell death. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that SNAP23 and ATG16L1 proteins form a stable complex independent of nutrient condition  whereas in the nutrient-depleted state  BAX binds to SNAP23 to form a ternary BAX-SNAP23-ATG16L1 protein complex. Taken together  these data support a model in which SNAP23 plays a crucial function as a scaffold for ATG16L1 necessary for the suppression of BAX activation and induction of the intrinsic cell death program.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and Aging: Is There a Sensible Link?Aging is a complex irreversible biological process associated with increased prevalence of chronic disease and high healthcare burden. Several theories have been proposed for the biology of aging including free radical accumulation  DNA damage  apoptosis  telomere shortening  autophagy failure  and disturbed autonomic response. Aging is also closely associated with progressive deterioration of cardiovascular and neurological functions. Linkage  genome-wide association (GWAS)  and next-generation sequencing analysis have confirmed a number of susceptibility loci for aging  in particular  Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence from our group and others also revealed a tie between genetic mutation of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and life span as well as cardiovascular aging. ALDH2 represents the single most gene with the greatest number of human genetic polymorphism and is deemed an important enzyme for detoxification of reactive aldehydes. Here  we will briefly review the tie between ALDH2 and cardiovascular aging process. While recent work on ALDH2 research has broadened the pathogenic mechanisms of ALDH2 mutation or deficiency  therapeutic potential targeting ALDH2 in the elderly still remains debatable.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of PINK1-Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy Degrades Mitochondrial Quality Control Proteins in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.Corneal endothelium (CE) is a monolayer of mitochondria-rich cells  critical for maintaining corneal transparency compatible with clear vision. Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a heterogeneous  genetically complex disorder  where oxidative stress plays a key role in the rosette formation during the degenerative loss of CE. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation along with excessive mitophagy activation has been detected in FECD; however  the mechanism of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics in CE cell loss is poorly understood. Here  the role of oxidative stress in mitophagy activation in FECD is investigated. Immunoblotting of FECD ex vivo specimens revealed an accumulation of PINK1 and phospho-Parkin (Ser65) along with loss of total Parkin and total Drp1. Similarly  modeling of rosette formation with menadione (MN)  led to phospho-Parkin accumulation in fragmented mitochondria resulting in mitophagy-induced mitochondrial clearance  albeit possibly in a PINK1-independent manner. Loss of PINK1  phospho-Drp1  and total Drp1 was prominent after MN-induced oxidative stress  but not after mitochondrial depolarization by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. Moreover  MN-induced mitophagy led to degradation of Parkin along with sequestration of Drp1 and PINK1 that was rescued by mitophagy inhibition. This study shows that in FECD  intracellular oxidative stress induces Parkin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation where endogenous Drp1 and PINK1 are sequestered and degraded by mitophagy during degenerative loss of post-mitotic cells of ocular tissue.,Autophagy_notLIR
Il-10 signaling reduces survival in mouse models of synucleinopathy.Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation leading to the premise that anti-inflammatory therapies could ameliorate synucleinopathy and associated sequelae. To test this idea  we used recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) to express the anti-inflammatory cytokine  Interleukin (Il)-10  in Line M83 transgenic mice that expresses the PD-associated A53T mutant human α-synuclein (αSyn). Contrary to our expectations  we observed that intraspinal Il-10 expression initiated at birth upregulated microgliosis and led to early death in homozygous M83+/+ mice. We further observed that Il-10 preconditioning led to reduced lifespan in the hemizygous M83+/- mice injected with preformed αSyn aggregates in hindlimb muscles. To determine the mechanistic basis for these adverse effects  we took advantage of the I87A variant Il-10 (vIl-10) that has predominantly immunosuppressive properties. Sustained intraspinal expression of vIl-10 in preformed αSyn-aggregate seeded M83+/- mice resulted in earlier death  accelerated αSyn pathology  pronounced microgliosis  and increased apoptosis compared to control mice. AAV-vIl-10 expression robustly induced p62 and neuronal LC3B accumulation in these mice  indicating that Il-10 signaling mediated preconditioning of the neuraxis can potentially exacerbate αSyn accumulation through autophagy dysfunction in the neurons. Together  our data demonstrate unexpected adverse effects of both Il-10 and its immunosuppressive variant  vIl-10  in a mouse model of PD  highlighting the pleiotropic functions of immune mediators and their complex role in non-cell autonomous signaling in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
p21cip1/waf1 Coordinate Autophagy  Proliferation and Apoptosis in Response to Metabolic Stress.Cancer cells possess metabolic properties that are different from benign cells. These unique characteristics have become attractive targets that are being actively investigated for cancer therapy. p21cip1/waf1  also known as Cyclin-Dependent Kinase inhibitor 1A  is encoded by the <i>CDKN1A</i> gene. It is a major p53 target gene involved in cell cycle progression that has been extensively evaluated. To date  p21 has been reported to regulate various cell functions  both dependent and independent of p53. Besides regulating the cell cycle  p21 also modulates apoptosis  induces senescence  and maintains cellular quiescence in response to various stimuli. p21 transcription is induced in response to stresses  including those from oxidative and chemotherapeutic treatment. A recent study has shown that in response to metabolic stresses such as nutrient and energy depletion  p21 expression is induced to regulate various cell functions. Despite the biological significance  the mechanism of p21 regulation in cancer adaptation to metabolic stress is underexplored and thus represents an exciting field. This review focuses on the recent development of p21 regulation in response to metabolic stress and its impact in inducing cell cycle arrest and death in cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ferroptosis: An emerging approach for targeting cancer stem cells and drug resistance.Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remains a major challenge in the fierce battle against cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small population of cells in tumors that possesses the ability to self-renew  initiate tumors  and cause resistance to conventional anticancer agents. Targeting this population of cells was proven as a promising approach to eliminate cancer recurrence and improve the clinical outcome. CSCs are less susceptible to death by classical anticancer agents inducing apoptosis. CSCs can be eradicated by ferroptosis  which is a non-apoptotic-regulated mechanism of cell death. The induction of ferroptosis is an attractive strategy to eliminate tumors due to its ability to selectively target aggressive CSCs. The current review critically explored the crosstalk and regulatory pathways controlling ferroptosis  which can selectively induce CSCs death. In addition  successful chemotherapeutic agents that achieve better therapeutic outcomes through the induction of ferroptosis in CSCs were discussed to highlight their promising clinical impact.,Autophagy_notLIR
Exosomes promote caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 infection by inhibiting autophagy.Caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 (CPIV3) is a novel important pathogen causing respiratory disease in goats  but the pathogenic mechanism is not clear yet. Evidence suggests that exosomes transfer biologically active molecules between cells. Viral infections can cause profound changes in exosome components  and exosomes have been involved in viral transmission and pathogenicity. In this study  we explored the characteristics and functions of exosomes purified from the supernatant of Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells inoculated with CPIV3. Infection of CPIV3 showed increased exosome secretion and the loading of viral proteins and RNA into exosomes. These exosomes were capable of transferring CPIV3 genetic materials to recipient cells to establish a productive infection and promote the viral replication. To explore the potential mechanism  small RNA deep sequencing revealed that CPIV3 exosomes contained a diverse range of RNA species  including miRNA and piRNA  in proportions different from exosomes isolated from mock-infected cells. Expression patterns of 11 differentially expressed miRNAs were subsequently validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Targets of miRNAs were predicted and functional annotation analysis showed that the main pathways involved were autophagy signalling ways. Autophagy inhibited by the CPIV3-exosome was further verified  and miR-126-3 p_2 packaged in the vesicles was an important regulation factor in this process. Inhibition of autophagy may be one of the responsible reasons for promoting efficient replication of exosome-mediated CPIV3 infection. The study suggests that exosomes are key in pathogenesis or protection against CPIV3. Further understating of their role in CPIV3 infection may bring novel insight to the development of protection measures.,Autophagy_notLIR
Two-pore and TRPML cation channels: Regulators of phagocytosis  autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis.The old Greek saying "Panta Rhei" ("everything flows") is true for all life and all living things in general. It also becomes nicely evident when looking closely into cells. There  material from the extracellular space is taken up by endocytic processes and transported to endosomes where it is sorted either for recycling or degradation. Cargo is also packaged for export through exocytosis involving the Golgi network  lysosomes and other organelles. Everything in this system is in constant motion and many proteins are necessary to coordinate transport along the different intracellular pathways to avoid chaos. Among these proteins are ion channels.  in particular TRPML channels (mucolipins) and two-pore channels (TPCs) which reside on endosomal and lysosomal membranes to speed up movement between organelles  e.g. by regulating fusion and fission; they help readjust pH and osmolarity changes due to such processes  or they promote exocytosis of export material. Pathophysiologically  these channels are involved in neurodegenerative  metabolic  retinal and infectious diseases  cancer  pigmentation defects  and immune cell function  and thus have been proposed as novel pharmacological targets  e.g. for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders  Duchenne muscular dystrophy  or different types of cancer. Here  we discuss the similarities but also differences of TPCs and TRPMLs in regulating phagocytosis  autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis  and we address the contradictions and open questions in the field relating to the roles TPCs and TRPMLs play in these different processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Role of Autophagy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic intestinal inflammatory disease  including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The abnormality of inflammatory and immune responses in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of IBD. Autophagy is a vital catabolic process in cells. Recent studies report that autophagy is highly involved in various kinds of diseases  especially inflammation-related diseases  such as IBD. In this review  the biological characteristics of autophagy and its role in IBD will be described and discussed based on recent literature. In addition  several therapies for IBD through modulating the inflammasome and intestinal microbiota taking advantage of autophagy regulation will be introduced. We aim to bring new insight in the exploration of mechanisms for IBD and development of novel therapeutic strategies against IBD.,Autophagy_notLIR
NRF2-dependent gene expression promotes ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling.The transcription factor NRF2 is a master regulator of cellular antioxidant and detoxification responses  but it also regulates other processes such as autophagy and pluripotency. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)  NRF2 antagonizes neuroectoderm differentiation  which only occurs after NRF2 is repressed via a Primary Cilia-Autophagy-NRF2 (PAN) axis. However  the functional connections between NRF2 and primary cilia  microtubule-based plasma membrane protrusions that function as cellular antennae  remain poorly understood. For instance  nothing is known about whether NRF2 affects cilia  or whether cilia regulation of NRF2 extends beyond hESCs. Here  we show that NRF2 and primary cilia reciprocally regulate each other. First  we demonstrate that fibroblasts lacking primary cilia have higher NRF2 activity  which is rescued by autophagy-activating mTOR inhibitors  indicating that the PAN axis also operates in differentiated cells. Furthermore  NRF2 controls cilia formation and function. NRF2-null cells grow fewer and shorter cilia and display impaired Hedgehog signaling  a cilia-dependent pathway. These defects are not due to increased oxidative stress or ciliophagy  but rather to NRF2 promoting expression of multiple ciliogenic and Hedgehog pathway genes. Among these  we focused on GLI2 and GLI3  the transcription factors controlling Hh pathway output. Both their mRNA and protein levels are reduced in NRF2-null cells  consistent with their gene promoters containing consensus ARE sequences predicted to bind NRF2. Moreover  GLI2 and GLI3 fail to accumulate at the ciliary tip of NRF2-null cells upon Hh pathway activation. Given the importance of NRF2 and ciliary signaling in human disease  our data may have important biomedical implications.,Autophagy_notLIR
Furazolidone Increases Survival of Mice Exposed to Lethal Total Body Irradiation through the Antiapoptosis and Antiautophagy Mechanism.Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) causes dose- and tissue-specific lethality. However  there are few effective and nontoxic radiation countermeasures for the radiation injury. In the current study  mice were pretreated with a traditional antimicrobial agent  FZD  before TBI; the protective effects of FZD on radiation injury were evaluated by using parameters such as the spleen index and thymus index  immunohistochemical staining of intestinal tissue  and frequency of micronuclei in polychromatophilic erythrocytes of bone marrow. The intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated that FZD administration significantly improved the survival of lethal dose-irradiated mice  decreased the number of micronuclei  upregulated the number of leukocytes and immune organ indices  and restored intestinal integrity in mice after TBI. TUNEL and western blot showed that FZD protected intestinal tissue by downregulating radiation-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Meanwhile  FZD protected IEC-6 cells from radiation-induced cell death by inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy. To sum up  FZD protected against radiation-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo through antiapoptosis and antiautophagy mechanisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
The involvement of PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 in regulating the activation of autophagy in scallop Patinopecten yessoensis after acute high temperature stress.Beclin 1 and LC3 are important autophagy regulation proteins involved in vesicle nucleation and extension stage  respectively. In the present study  a Beclin 1 and a LC3 were identified from Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3). The open reading frame (ORF) of PyBeclin 1 was of 1335 bp encoding a putative polypeptide of 444 amino acid residues with an N-terminal BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain  a central coiled-coil domain (CCD)  and a C-terminal evolutionarily conserved domain (ECD). The ORF of PyLC3 was of 369 bp encoding a putative polypeptide of 122 amino acid residues with an APG12 domain. The deduced amino acid sequences of PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 shared 31.92-74.09% and 68.38-79.50% identities with Beclin 1s and LC3s from other species  respectively. The mRNA transcripts of PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 were found to be expressed in all the examined tissues  including adductor muscle  gonad  gill  haemocytes and mantle  with the highest expression level in gill and haemocytes. The mRNA expression level of PyBeclin 1 in haemocytes increased significantly at 1  3  6  12 and 24 h (2.98-4.07 fold of that in the Blank group  p < 0.05)  and returned to normal level at 48 h after acute high temperature stress at 25 °C. Unlike PyBeclin 1  the mRNA transcripts of PyLC3 in haemocytes were significantly up-regulated at1  3  6 and 12 h (1.80-2.54 fold of that in the Blank group  p < 0.05)  then decreased to blank level at 24 h (p > 0.05)  and increased significantly again at 48 h (3.70 fold of that in the Blank group  p < 0.05) after high temperature. PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 were mainly located in the cytoplasm and a small amount in the nucleus with few puncta  and the numbers of PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 puncta increased at 3 h after acute high temperature stress. The LC3-II levels in gill and haemocytes were significantly up-regulated at 1 h and 3 h after acute high temperature stress. These results collectively suggested that PyBeclin 1 and PyLC3 were conserved members of Beclin 1 and LC3 family in scallops  and involved in regulating the activation of autophagy in scallops after acute high temperature stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulatory Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Autophagy: Lessons From Yeast.Mitochondria produce the majority of ATP required by cells <i>via</i> oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore  regulation of mitochondrial quality and quantity is important for maintaining cellular activities. Mitophagy  the selective degradation of mitochondria  is thought to contribute to control of mitochondrial quality and quantity. In recent years  the molecular mechanism of mitophagy has been extensively studied in yeast and mammalian cells. In particular  identification of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 has contributed to substantial progress in understanding of mitophagy in yeast. This review summarizes the molecular mechanism of mitophagy in yeast and compares it to the mechanism of mitophagy in mammals. We also discuss the current understanding of mitophagy in plants.,Autophagy_notLIR
Adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon attenuates calcification of osteoarthritis chondrocytes by promoting autophagy.Cartilage calcification contributes to the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). It has been well-investigated adiponectin regulates vascular calcification. The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic value and the molecular mechanism of AdipoRon  an adiponectin receptor agonist  on the chondrocytes calcification. Primary chondrocytes were isolated and cultured from normal cartilage and OA cartilage. The calcification in tissues was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectroscopy and alizarin red S staining. The calcification in chondrocytes was determined using the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and an ALP assay kit. The cellular effects of AdipoRon were assessed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. We found that calcification was significantly increased in OA cartilage tissues and cells. Importantly  the degree of calcification and ALP activity of the OA chondrocytes was decreased upon the treatment with AdipoRon. The AdipoRon-induced cellular effects  including the reduction of the calcification of chondrocytes and improvement of autophagy  were blocked by dorsomorphin  an 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor. Moreover  autophagy activation by AdipoRon was mediated by the AMPK-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that AdipoRon significantly alleviates the calcification of OA chondrocytes via activating AMPK-mTOR signaling to promote autophagy. Therefore  AdipoRon could be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of OA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Non-canonical autophagy functions of ATG16L1 in epithelial cells limit lethal infection by influenza A virus.Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cause pandemic infections where cytokine storm syndrome and lung inflammation lead to high mortality. Given the high social and economic cost of respiratory viruses  there is an urgent need to understand how the airways defend against virus infection. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that ATG16L1-dependent targeting of LC3 to single-membrane  non-autophagosome compartments - referred to as non-canonical autophagy - protects mice from lethal IAV infection. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs  coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells  leads to fulminant pneumonia  lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy reduced IAV fusion with endosomes and activation of interferon signalling. Conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showed that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leucocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence that restricts IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cell type-specific modulation of healthspan by Forkhead family transcription factors in the nervous system.Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) increases healthy lifespan among diverse animal species. Downstream of IIS  multiple evolutionarily conserved transcription factors (TFs) are required; however  distinct TFs are likely responsible for these effects in different tissues. Here we have asked which TFs can extend healthy lifespan within distinct cell types of the adult nervous system in <i>Drosophila</i> Starting from published single-cell transcriptomic data  we report that <i>forkhead</i> (FKH) is endogenously expressed in neurons  whereas <i>forkhead-box-O</i> (FOXO) is expressed in glial cells. Accordingly  we find that neuronal FKH and glial FOXO exert independent prolongevity effects. We have further explored the role of neuronal FKH in a model of Alzheimer's disease-associated neuronal dysfunction  where we find that increased neuronal FKH preserves behavioral function and reduces ubiquitinated protein aggregation. Finally  using transcriptomic profiling  we identify <i>Atg17</i>  a member of the Atg1 autophagy initiation family  as one FKH-dependent target whose neuronal overexpression is sufficient to extend healthy lifespan. Taken together  our results underscore the importance of cell type-specific mapping of TF activity to preserve healthy function with age.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aggregation-induced integrated stress response rejuvenates culture-expanded human mesenchymal stem cells.Protein homeostasis is critical for cellular function  as loss of homeostasis is attributed to aging and the accumulation of unwanted proteins. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising therapeutic potential due to their impressive abilities to secrete inflammatory modulators  angiogenic  and regenerative cytokines. However  there exists the problem of human MSC expansion with compromised therapeutic quality. Duringin vitro expansion  human MSCs are plated on stiff plastics and undergo culture adaptation  which results in aberrant proliferation  shifts in metabolism  and decreased autophagic activity. It has previously been shown that three-dimensional (3D) aggregation can reverse some of these alterations by heightening autophagy and recovering the metabolic state back to a naïve phenotype. To further understand the proteostasis in human MSC culture  this study investigated the effects of 3D aggregation on the human MSC proteome to determine the specific pathways altered by aggregation. The 3D aggregates and 2D cultures of human MSCs derived from bone marrow (bMSC) and adipose tissue (ASC) were analyzed along with differentiated human dermal fibroblasts (FB). The proteomics analysis showed the elevated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 pathway and the upregulated activity of the integrated stress response (ISR) in 3D aggregates. Specific protein quantification further determined that bMSC and ASC responded to ISR  while FB did not. 3D aggregation significantly increased the ischemic survival of bMSCs and ASCs. Perturbation of ISR with small molecules salubrinal and GSK2606414 resulted in differential responses of bMSC  ASC  and FB. This study indicates that aggregation-based preconditioning culture holds the potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of expanded human MSCs via the establishment of ISR and homeostasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
EZH2 regulates H2B phosphorylation and elevates colon cancer cell autophagy.Epigenetic alterations  especially histone modification  play vital roles in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Upregulation of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been reported to contribute to the initiation and progression of colon cancer. This study analyzed the association between EZH2 and phosphorylation of H2B at tyrosine 37 (H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> ) in colon cancer tissues and cells  along with the influences of the EZH2-H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> axis on colon cancer cell autophagy. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess EZH2 and H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> expressions in clinical samples of colon cancer. Cell transfection was carried out to alter EZH2 and H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> expressions in colon cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull down assay were conducted to analyze the association between EZH2 and H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> . Western blotting was utilized to measure proteins expressions related to cell autophagy. We found that there was a positive association between EZH2 and H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> in colon cancer tissues and cells. EZH2 directly interacted with H2B and promoted H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> in colon cancer cells using ATP as a phosphate donor. Moreover  EZH2 levated colon cancer cell autophagy in starvation condition. H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> was required for EZH2-elevated colon cancer cell autophagy under starvation condition. The EZH2-H2B<sup>Y37ph</sup> axis elevated colon cancer cell autophagy possibly via activating transcriptional regulation of ATG genes. In conclusion  EZH2-elevated colon cancer initiation and progression at least in part via inducing colon cancer cell autophagy. EZH2 could phosphorylate H2B<sup>Y37</sup> and then induce transcription activation of ATG genes in colon cancer cells under starvation condition.,Autophagy_notLIR
How does estrogen work on autophagy?Macroautophagy/autophagy is vital for intracellular quality control and homeostasis. Therefore  careful regulation of autophagy is very important. In the past 10 years  a number of studies have reported that estrogenic effectors affect autophagy. However  some results  especially those regarding the modulatory effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on autophagy seem inconsistent. Moreover  several clinical trials are already in place combining both autophagy inducers and autophagy inhibitors with endocrine therapies for breast cancer. Not all patients experience benefit  which further confuses and complicates our understanding of the main effects of autophagy in estrogen-related cancer. In view of the importance of the crosstalk between estrogen signaling and autophagy  this review summarizes the estrogenic effectors reported to affect autophagy  subcellular distribution and translocation of estrogen receptors  autophagy-targeted transcription factors (TFs)  miRNAs  and histone modifications regulated by E2. Upon stimulation with estrogen  there will always be opposing functional actions  which might occur between different receptors  receptors on TFs  TFs on autophagy genes  or even histone modifications on transcription. The huge signaling network downstream of estrogen can promote autophagy and reduce overstimulated autophagy at the same time  which allows autophagy to be regulated by estrogen in a restricted range. To help understand how the estrogenic regulation of autophagy affects cell fate  a hypothetical model is presented here. Finally  we discuss some exciting new directions in the field. We hope this might help to better understand the multiple associations between estrogen and autophagy  the pathogenic mechanisms of many estrogen-related diseases  and to design novel and efficacious therapeutics. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AP-1  activator protein-1; HATs  histone acetyltransferases; HDAC  histone deacetylases; HOTAIR  HOX transcript antisense RNA.,Autophagy_notLIR
PAR2 promotes high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting AMPK-mediated autophagy.Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a member of G protein-coupled receptors. There are two types of PAR2 signaling pathways: Canonical G-protein signaling and β-arrestin signaling. Although PAR2 signaling has been reported to aggravate hepatic steatosis  the exact mechanism is still unclear  and the role of PAR2 in autophagy remains unknown. In this study  we investigated the regulatory role of PAR2 in autophagy during high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in mice. Increased protein levels of PAR2 and β-arrestin-2 and their interactions were detected after four months of HFD. To further investigate the role of PAR2  male and female wild-type (WT) and PAR2-knockout (PAR2 KO) mice were fed HFD. PAR2 deficiency protected HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in male mice  but not in female mice. Interestingly  PAR2-deficient liver showed increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation with decreased interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CAMKKβ) and β-arrestin-2. In addition  PAR2 deficiency up-regulated autophagy in the liver. To elucidate whether PAR2 plays a role in the regulation of autophagy and lipid accumulation in vitro  PAR2 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of PAR2 decreased AMPK activation with increased interaction of CAMKKβ with β-arrestin-2 and significantly inhibited autophagic responses in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of autophagy by PAR2 overexpression further exacerbated palmitate-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Collectively  these findings suggest that the increase in the PAR2-β-arrestin-2-CAMKKβ complex by HFD inhibits AMPK-mediated autophagy  leading to the alleviation of hepatic steatosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydroxychloroquine in rheumatic autoimmune disorders and beyond.Initially used as antimalarial drugs  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and  to a lesser extent  chloroquine (CQ) are currently being used to treat several diseases. Due to its cost-effectiveness  safety and efficacy  HCQ is especially used in rheumatic autoimmune disorders (RADs)  such as systemic lupus erythematosus  primary Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this widespread use in the clinic  HCQ molecular modes of action are still not completely understood. By influencing several cellular pathways through different mechanisms  CQ and HCQ inhibit multiple endolysosomal functions  including autophagy  as well as endosomal Toll-like receptor activation and calcium signalling. These effects alter several aspects of the immune system with the synergistic consequence of reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and release  one of the most marked symptoms of RADs. Here  we review the current knowledge on the molecular modes of action of these drugs and the circumstances under which they trigger side effects. This is of particular importance as the therapeutic use of HCQ is expanding beyond the treatment of malaria and RADs.,Autophagy_notLIR
The emergence of drug resistance to targeted cancer therapies: Clinical evidence.For many decades classical anti-tumor therapies included chemotherapy  radiation and surgery; however  in the last two decades  following the identification of the genomic drivers and main hallmarks of cancer  the introduction of therapies that target specific tumor-promoting oncogenic or non-oncogenic pathways  has revolutionized cancer therapeutics. Despite the significant progress in cancer therapy  clinical oncologists are often facing the primary impediment of anticancer drug resistance  as many cancer patients display either intrinsic chemoresistance from the very beginning of the therapy or after initial responses and upon repeated drug treatment cycles  acquired drug resistance develops and thus relapse emerges  resulting in increased mortality. Our attempts to understand the molecular basis underlying these drug resistance phenotypes in pre-clinical models and patient specimens revealed the extreme plasticity and adaptive pathways employed by tumor cells  being under sustained stress and extensive genomic/proteomic instability due to the applied therapeutic regimens. Subsequent efforts have yielded more effective inhibitors and combinatorial approaches (e.g. the use of specific pharmacologic inhibitors with immunotherapy) that exhibit synergistic effects against tumor cells  hence enhancing therapeutic indices. Furthermore  new advanced methodologies that allow for the early detection of genetic/epigenetic alterations that lead to drug chemoresistance and prospective validation of biomarkers which identify patients that will beneﬁt from certain drug classes  have started to improve the clinical outcome. This review discusses emerging principles of drug resistance to cancer therapies targeting a wide array of oncogenic kinases  along with hedgehog pathway and the proteasome and apoptotic inducers  as well as epigenetic and metabolic modulators. We further discuss mechanisms of resistance to monoclonal antibodies  immunomodulators and immune checkpoint inhibitors  potential biomarkers of drug response/drug resistance  along with possible new therapeutic avenues for the clinicians to combat devastating drug resistant malignancies. It is foreseen that these topics will be major areas of focused multidisciplinary translational research in the years to come.,Autophagy_notLIR
A kidney perspective on the mechanism of action of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.Sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney failure in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the precise underlying mechanisms for these nephroprotective effects are incompletely understood  various hypotheses have been proposed including reductions in intraglomerular pressure through restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback  blood pressure reduction and favorable effects on vascular function  reduction in tubular workload and hypoxia  and metabolic effects resulting in increased autophagy. Here  we review these mechanisms  which may also explain the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function in patients without T2D.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy is involved in the protective effect of p21 on LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction.p21 has emerged as an important protein involved in cardiovascular diseases  but its role remains controversial. Recently  p21 has been reported to mediate inflammatory responses. As inflammatory responses are a feature of sepsis  our study investigated whether p21 has a role in cardiac dysfunction induced by sepsis and analyzed the mechanisms involved. To establish a mouse sepsis model  p21 global knockout (p21KO) and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) male mice were treated with 5 mg/kg LPS intraperitoneally for 6  24  or 48 h. After LPS stimulation  the level of p21 had significantly increased in the WT mice and in cardiomyocytes. Cardiac dysfunction induced by LPS was markedly aggravated in p21KO mice relative to that of WT mice. Downregulation of p21 expression exacerbated the LPS-mediated inflammatory response  and it increased oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial damage in the heart and in cardiomyocytes. In contrast  overexpressing p21 attenuated the increase of TNFα and promoted the increase of SOD2. Moreover  p21 regulated the LPS-induced autophagy activation; that is  the increase in autophagy was impaired when p21 expression was decreased  whereas the increase was significant when p21 was overexpressed. The autophagy inducer rapamycin partially rescued the cardiac deterioration caused by p21 downregulation in the LPS-stimulated groups. In addition  p21 regulated the autophagy level by interacting with LC3B. These results revealed that p21 controls LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction by modulating inflammatory and oxidative stress  and it is partially dependent on regulating the autophagy level. This study is the first to show that p21 could interact with LC3B to promote autophagy for the improvement of cardiac function during sepsis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Morphology Remodeling and Selective Autophagy of Intracellular Organelles during Viral Infections.Viruses have evolved different strategies to hijack subcellular organelles during their life cycle to produce robust infectious progeny. Successful viral reproduction requires the precise assembly of progeny virions from viral genomes  structural proteins  and membrane components. Such spatial and temporal separation of assembly reactions depends on accurate coordination among intracellular compartmentalization in multiple organelles. Here  we overview the rearrangement and morphology remodeling of virus-triggered intracellular organelles. Focus is given to the quality control of intracellular organelles  the hijacking of the modified organelle membranes by viruses  morphology remodeling for viral replication  and degradation of intracellular organelles by virus-triggered selective autophagy. Understanding the functional reprogram and morphological remodeling in the virus-organelle interplay can provide new insights into the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Blocking retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes contributes to sevoflurane-induced neuron apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice.Autophagy  a crucial pathway for the degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells  is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and the accumulated autophagosomes in the cells resulting in the death of cells. Sevoflurane can impair spatial learning and memory in mice with AD and lead to the apoptosis of nerve cells; however  the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We aim to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of sevoflurane in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice. 51 heterozygous APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice were involved and divided into three groups  including control group  sham group and sevoflurane group. Morris water maze experiment was used to test the learning and memory abilities of mice  flow cytometry was conducted to detect apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential of brain cells in mice  transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the number of autophagosomes at the axon in mice  and western blot was carried out to detect the expression of Bax  Bcl-2  LC3II  P62  KIF3B and DIC proteins of brain cells in mice. In our study  we found that significantly longer escape latencies  fewer crossings of the platform and shorter time spent in the target quadrant of the morris water maze experiment in the sevoflurane group. Flow cytometry showed cellular apoptosis was increased and the membrane potential of the mitochondria was reduced of brain cells in the sevoflurane group. Transmission electron microscopy displayed that there was a remarkable upregulation of autophagosomes at the axon of brain cells in mice after treatment of sevoflurane. Western blot demonstrated that the expression of Bax  LC3II  P62 and KIF3B proteins were elevated  and the expression of Bcl-2 and DIC proteins were reduced in the sevoflurane group. Sevoflurane impaired acquisition learning and memory function  promoted the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice  and the mechanism might be related to the activation of autophagy along with the disruption of autophagosomes retrograde transport in axons.,Autophagy_notLIR
Bilobalide alleviates neuroinflammation and promotes autophagy in Alzheimer's disease by upregulating lincRNA-p21.EGb 761 has some protective effects on AD and can improve the cognitive functions of AD mice. However  the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here  we investigated the function of bilobalide  the effective component of EGb 761  in neuroinflammation and autophagy during AD. LPS-treated BV-2 cells were used as an <i>in vitro</i> model for neuroinflammation. The APP/PS1 AD mouse line was used to examine the function of bilobalide in AD. ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to measure the levels of proinflammatory cytokines  including TNF-α  IL-6 and IL-1β. Western blotting was employed to determine the protein levels of p-p65  iNOS  COX-2  LC3  beclin-1  p62 and p-STAT3. Immunostaining was applied to examine the number of autophagosomes. LPS treatment induced inflammatory responses and inhibited autophagy in BV-2 cells. Bilobalide suppressed LPS-induced neuroinflammation and promoted autophagy. Furthermore  bilobalide treatment increased the lincRNA-p21 levels  which suppressed STAT3 signalling. Knockdown of lincRNA-p21 reversed the effects of bilobalide. Overexpression of lincRNA-p21 promoted autophagy and inhibited neuroinflammation as well while STAT3 inhibitor blocked the effects of si-lincRNA-p21. <i>In vivo</i> experiments revealed that bilobalide improved the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 AD mice. Bilobalide improves the cognitive functions of APP/PS1 AD mice. Mechanistically  bilobalide suppresses inflammatory responses and promotes autophagy possibly by upregulating lincRNA-p21 levels.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuronal mitochondrial calcium uniporter deficiency exacerbates axonal injury and suppresses remyelination in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.High-capacity mitochondrial calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake by the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) is strategically positioned to support the survival and remyelination of axons in multiple sclerosis (MS) by undocking mitochondria  buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup> and elevating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis at metabolically stressed sites. Respiratory chain deficits in MS are proposed to metabolically compromise axon survival and remyelination by suppressing MCU activity. In support of this hypothesis  clinical scores  mitochondrial dysfunction  myelin loss  axon damage and inflammation were elevated while remyelination was blocked in neuronal MCU deficient (Thy1-MCU Def) mice relative to Thy1 controls subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). At the first sign of walking deficits  mitochondria in EAE/Thy1 axons showed signs of activation. By contrast  cytoskeletal damage  fragmented mitochondria and large autophagosomes were seen in EAE/Thy1-MCU Def axons. As EAE severity increased  EAE/Thy1 axons were filled with massively swollen mitochondria with damaged cristae while EAE/Thy1-MCU Def axons were riddled with late autophagosomes. ATP concentrations and mitochondrial gene expression were suppressed while calpain activity  autophagy-related gene mRNA levels and autophagosome marker (LC3) co-localization in Thy1-expressing neurons were elevated in the spinal cords of EAE/Thy1-MCU Def compared to EAE/Thy1 mice. These findings suggest that MCU inhibition contributes to axonal damage that drives MS progression.,Autophagy_notLIR
RNA N6-methyladenosine: a new player in autophagy-mediated anti-cancer drug resistance.Dysregulation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is associated with cancer development and progression. The m6A modification plays a crucial role in autophagy regulation precipitating anti-cancer drug resistance. In line with this fact  this commentary discusses m6A modification interfering with autophagy machinery as a major contributing factor for drug resistance in cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Long Noncoding Competing Endogenous RNA Networks in Pancreatic Cancer.Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly malignant disease characterized by insidious onset  rapid progress  and poor therapeutic effects. The molecular mechanisms associated with PC initiation and progression are largely insufficient  hampering the exploitation of novel diagnostic biomarkers and development of efficient therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence recently reveals that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)  including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)  extensively participate in PC pathogenesis. Specifically  lncRNAs can function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs)  competitively sequestering miRNAs  therefore modulating the expression levels of their downstream target genes. Such complex lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA networks  namely  ceRNA networks  play crucial roles in the biological processes of PC by regulating cell growth and survival  epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis  cancer stem cell maintenance  metabolism  autophagy  chemoresistance  and angiogenesis. In this review  the emerging knowledge on the lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks involved in PC initiation and progression will be summarized  and the potentials of the competitive crosstalk as diagnostic  prognostic  and therapeutic targets will be comprehensively discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Extracellular vesicles degradation pathway based autophagy lysosome pathway.As an ancient intracellular degradation pathway  the autophagy lysosome pathway exists in various cells continuously and stably and maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles and misfolded proteins that are prejudicial to cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including microparticles and exosomes  are derived from varieties of mammalian tissue cells such as platelets  endothelial cells  cardiomyocytes. Through large quantity of active substances carried by EVs  EVs exert momentous biological functions. Recent researches have revealed the molecular mechanism of the interaction between extracellular vesicles and autophagy. In this review  we first elaborate that extracellular vesicles are identified and internalized by target cells by means of receptor-ligand. Since extracellular vesicles contain multiple functional molecules  we subsequently describe the process of intracellular autophagy pathway induced by extracellular vesicles  which activates autophagy-related pathways or delivers autophagy-associated molecules. Finally  we introduced the effects of extracellular vesicle-induced autophagy on extracellular vesicles and target cells respectively. In conclusion  this article integrates relevant theoretical knowledge of autophagy caused by extracellular vesicles and provides a new direction for the study of extracellular vesicles in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
A PI polyamide-TPP conjugate targeting a mtDNA mutation induces cell death of cancer cells with the mutation.Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations occur frequently in cancer cells  and some of them are often homoplasmic. Targeting such mtDNA mutations could be a new method for killing cancer cells with minimal impact on normal cells. Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) are cell-permeable minor groove binders that show sequence-specific binding to double-stranded DNA and inhibit the transcription of target genes. PIP conjugated with the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation can be delivered to mitochondria without uptake into the nucleus. Here  we investigated the feasibility of the use of PIP-TPP to target a mtDNA mutation in order to kill cancer cells that harbor the mutation. We synthesized hairpin-type PIP-TPP targeting the A3243G mutation and examined its effects on the survival of HeLa cybrid cells with or without the mutation (HeLamtA3243G cells or HeLamtHeLa cells  respectively). A surface plasmon resonance assay demonstrated that PIP-TPP showed approximately 60-fold higher binding affinity for the mutant G-containing synthetic double-stranded DNA than for the wild-type A-containing DNA. When added to cells  it localized in mitochondria and induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production  extensive mitophagy  and apoptosis in HeLamtA3243G cells  while only slightly exerting these effects in HeLamtHeLa cells. These results suggest that PIP-TPPs targeting mtDNA mutations could be potential chemotherapeutic drugs to treat cancers without severe adverse effects.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activators of SIRT1 in the kidney and protective effects of SIRT1 during acute kidney injury (AKI) (effect of SIRT1 activators on acute kidney injury).Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder and a clinical condition characterized by acute reduction in renal function. If AKI is not treated  it can lead to chronic kidney disease  which is associated with a high risk of death. SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) is an NAD-dependent deacetylase. This enzyme is responsible for the processes of DNA repair or recombination  chromosomal stability  and gene transcription. This enzyme also plays a protective role in many diseases  including AKI. In this study  we review the mechanisms that mediate the protective effects of SIRT1 on AKI  including SIRT1 activators.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antiangiogenic effect of arsenic trioxide in HUVECs by FoxO3a-regulated autophagy.Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to have antitumor effect in different tumors  although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Autophagy plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy and has been found to be activated by ATO in different cells. However  the role of autophagy in the antitumor effect of ATO has not yet been elucidated. In this study  we investigated the role of autophagy in the antiangiogenic effect of ATO in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and its underlying mechanism. Our data showed that ATO suppresses angiogenesis and induces autophagy in HUVECs through upregulation of forkhead box protein O3 (FoxO3a). Co-incubated with autophagy inhibitor or knockdown of FoxO3a effectively inhibited ATO-induced autophagy and reversed the antiangiogenic effect of ATO  indicating that ATO-induced autophagy plays an antiangiogenic role in HUVECs. Our results highlight the importance of autophagy in the antiangiogenic effect of ATO and provide an improved understanding of the function of ATO.,Autophagy_notLIR
LncRNA BACE1-AS Promotes Autophagy-Mediated Neuronal Damage Through The miR-214-3p/ATG5 Signalling Axis In Alzheimer's Disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be among the most promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets of AD. Here  we aimed to investigate whether lncRNA BACE1-AS plays a role in the potential mechanisms of AD. The expression of BACE1-AS  miR-214-3p and ATG5 mRNA was detected using qRT-PCR. The expression of the LC3  P62  ATG5  Bcl-2  p-Tau and cleaved-caspase 3 proteins was examined using western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis  cytotoxicity and ROS levels were estimated using flow cytometry  an LDH kit and a DCFH-DA assay  respectively. The interaction between BACE1-AS or ATG5 and miR-214-3p was validated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. HE staining and a TUNEL assay were employed to evaluate hippocampal neuronal injury. The BACE1-AS level was found to be upregulated in serum samples of AD patients  brain tissues of AD transgenic (Tg) mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Autophagy activity was increased in both Tg mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated cells. BACE1-AS knockdown alleviated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cell injury. Rapamycin abolished the protective effects of sh BACE1-AS against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> induced cell injury. BACE1-AS indirectly regulated ATG5 expression by binding miR-214-3p. The miR-214-3p inhibitor reversed the protective effects of sh BACE1-AS and sh ATG5 against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cell injury. Knockdown of BACE1-AS alleviated neuronal injury by repressing autophagy in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that silencing of BACE1-AS alleviated neuronal injury by regulating autophagy through the miR-214-3p/ATG5 signalling axis in AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
STX17 dynamically regulated by Fis1 induces mitophagy via hierarchical macroautophagic mechanism.Mitophagy is the selective autophagic targeting and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. While PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy is well-characterized  PINK1/Parkin-independent route is poorly understood. Using structure illumination microscopy (SR-SIM)  we demonstrate that the SNARE protein Syntaxin 17 (STX17) initiates mitophagy upon depletion of outer mitochondrial membrane protein Fis1. With proteomics analysis  we identify the STX17-Fis1 interaction  which controls the dynamic shuffling of STX17 between ER and mitochondria. Fis1 loss results in aberrant STX17 accumulation on mitochondria  which exposes the N terminus and promotes self-oligomerization to trigger mitophagy. Mitochondrial STX17 interacts with ATG14 and recruits core autophagy proteins to form mitophagosome  followed by Rab7-dependent mitophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore  Fis1 loss impairs mitochondrial respiration and potentially sensitizes cells to mitochondrial clearance  which is mediated through canonical autophagy machinery  closely linking non-selective macroautophagy to mitochondrial turnover. Our findings uncover a PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagic mechanism in which outer mitochondrial membrane protein Fis1 regulates mitochondrial quality control.,Autophagy_notLIR
Insights into new mechanisms and models of cancer stem cell multidrug resistance.The acquisition of genetic alterations  clonal evolution  and the tumor microenvironment promote cancer progression  metastasis and therapy resistance. These events correspond to the establishment of the great phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of cancer cells that contribute to tumor progression and resistant disease. Targeting resistant cancers is a major challenge in oncology; however  the underlying processes are not yet fully understood. Even though current treatments can reduce tumor size and increase life expectancy  relapse and multidrug resistance (MDR) ultimately remain the second cause of death in developed countries. Recent evidence points toward stem-like phenotypes in cancer cells  promoted by cancer stem cells (CSCs)  as the main culprit of cancer relapse  resistance (radiotherapy  hormone therapy  and/or chemotherapy) and metastasis. Many mechanisms have been proposed for CSC resistance  such as drug efflux through ABC transporters  overactivation of the DNA damage response (DDR)  apoptosis evasion  prosurvival pathways activation  cell cycle promotion and/or cell metabolic alterations. Nonetheless  targeted therapy toward these specific CSC mechanisms is only partially effective to prevent or abolish resistance  suggesting underlying additional causes for CSC resilience. This article aims to provide an integrated picture of the MDR mechanisms that operate in CSCs' behavior and to propose a novel model of tumor evolution during chemotherapy. Targeting the pathways mentioned here might hold promise and reveal new strategies for future clinical therapeutic approaches.,Autophagy_notLIR
Resveratrol attenuates hydrogen peroxide-induced aging through upregulation of autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Resveratrol (RESV; trans-3 5 4'-trihydroxystilbene) has emerged as a potential new therapeutic for age-related atherosclerotic diseases. However  the effect of RESV on cellular aging and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore  the aim of this study was to examine whether RESV can delay cellular aging through upregulation of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with impaired autophagic degradation via interleukin-6 in macrophages.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease associated with dysregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and autophagy. Although such disturbances are increasingly recognized in patients with SLE and animal models of the disease  little is known about the specific role of IL-6 and autophagy in SLE macrophages. Here  we investigated alterations in the IL-6 axis and autophagy in macrophages derived from patients with SLE and determined whether IL-6 modulates autophagy using human macrophage models. Serum IL-6 detected by ELISA was higher in SLE patients (n = 19) than in normal controls (n = 19  p < 0.001). Levels of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and autophagic markers LC3B and p62 in SLE and normal macrophages were assessed by real-time PCR  western blotting  and immunofluorescence. Compared with normal macrophages  SLE macrophages not only overexpressed IL-6Rs but also exhibited impaired autophagic degradation as evidenced by elevated levels of LC3B and p62. In vitro analyses using macrophage models revealed that prolonged exposure to exogenous recombinant human IL-6 induced a marked impairment of autophagic degradation indicated by elevated levels of LC3B and p62 in both primary macrophages and transformed macrophages. Pretreatment with tocilizumab  a humanized anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody  restored autophagic degradation and reversed p62 accumulation in a paracrine manner in macrophages. These findings demonstrate that SLE involves IL-6-induced impairment of autophagic degradation through augmentation of IL-6R in human macrophages.,Autophagy_notLIR

MicroRNA-638 induces apoptosis and autophagy in human liver cancer cells by targeting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).Liver cancer is of the devastating human cancers and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. The clinical outcomes are far from descent due to lack of efficient therapeutic targets and chemotherapeutic agents. Studies have revealed the therapeutic implications of microRNAs in the management of different human cancers. This study was designed to explore the role and therapeutic potential of miR-638 in liver cancer via modulation of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). The results revealed significant (P < 0.05) downregulation of miR-638 in human liver cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-638 led to a significant (P < 0.05) decline in liver cancer cell proliferation. Nonetheless  inhibition of miR-638 could promote the proliferation of the human liver cancer cells. The DAPI and annexin V/PI staining assays revealed that miR-638 induces apoptosis in human liver cancer cells which was accompanied by enhancement of Bax and depletion of Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore  miR-638 overexpression also leads to a significant (P < 0.05) increase of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in liver cancer cells suggestive of autophagy. The induction of autophagy was further confirmed by increase and decrease in expression of LC3B-II and Beclin-1 proteins  respectively. In contrary  inhibition of miR-638 prevented both apoptosis and autophagy of the liver cancer cells. In silico analysis and the dual luciferase assay revealed EZH2 as the molecular target of miR-638 at post-transcriptional level. The qRT-PCR showed that EZH2 to be significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated in the human liver cancer tissues and cell lines. However  the expression of EZH2 was considerably suppressed upon miR-638 overexpression in SNU-423 cells. Taken together  these findings suggest the tumor-suppressive role of miR-638/EZH2 axis liver cancer and point towards the potential of miR-638 as therapeutic target in the treatment of liver cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydrogen sulphide promotes osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.Hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S)  a gasotransmitter  plays an important role in the regulation of bone homeostasis. However  the precise effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on osteoclasts was still elusive. The goal of this study was to determine the potential role of H<sub>2</sub>S in regulation of osteoclasts and the underlying mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub>S affected osteoclastogenesis. The present study applied western blot  quantitative real-time PCR  tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining  pit formation assay  immunofluorescence confocal microscopy  transmission electron microscopy and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double-staining assay. The results showed that the expressions of cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine c-lyase (CSE) were obviously increased in osteoclast differentiation induced by the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL). In addition  H<sub>2</sub>S promoted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibited apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. Mechanistically  H<sub>2</sub>S inhibited autophagy in Raw 264.7 cells. Autophagy activator (rapamycin) alleviated the induction of osteoclast differentiation by H<sub>2</sub>S. Further studies showed that H<sub>2</sub>S inhibited autophagy by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. Taken together  our results implicated that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S could promote osteoclastogenesis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to downregulate autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 and its potential role in Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia  and its pathogenesis is still not clear. Peptidyl arginine deiminases 4(PAD4) as one of the important members of PAD family  is the only protein with nuclear transfer function  it can regulate the expression of many proteins through citrullinating histone. PAD4 can also interact with many transcription factors  involved in regulating gene expression. PAD4 expression is closely related to the inflammatory factors secreted  cell autophagy  tumorigenesis and other neurodegenerative diseases. More importantly  PAD4 and its citrullinated protein were found in cortical and hippocampal neurons of AD patients. To study the expression and regulatory pathway of PAD4 in vivo and in vitro experiments on AD may be of helpful to elucidate the pathogenesis of AD. Meanwhile  detection of anti-citrullinated antibody will have potential value as novel biomarkers of AD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antitumor activity of Cedrelone in temozolomide-resistant human glioma cells is accompanied by mitochondrial mediated apoptosis  inhibition of angiogenesis  cell cycle disruption and modulation of ERK/MAPK signalling pathway.Glioma is one of the most aggressive types of human cancers and responsible for considerable mortality across the globe.

6-Bromoindirubin-3'-Oxime (6BIO) Suppresses the mTOR Pathway  Promotes Autophagy  and Exerts Anti-aging Effects in Rodent Liver.Liver aging is associated with age-related histopathological and functional changes that significantly enhance the risk of numerous diseases or disorders developing in elderly populations. 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO)  a potent inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)  has been implicated in various age-related diseases and processes  such as tumorigenesis  neurodegeneration  and diabetes. Recent studies have also revealed that 6BIO increases autophagy in yeast  mammalian cell lines  and dopaminergic neurons  which is one of the classical mechanisms strongly associated with liver aging. However  the impact or the mechanism of action of 6BIO in liver remains entirely unknown. Here  we find that 6BIO reduces oxidative stress  improves lipid metabolism  enhances autophagy  and significantly retards liver aging <i>via</i> modulating the GSK-3β pathway and mTOR pathway. Our findings suggest that 6BIO could be a potential agent to protect the liver in the field of anti-aging pharmacology.,Autophagy_notLIR
A cancer associated somatic mutation in LC3B attenuates its binding to E1-like ATG7 protein and subsequent lipidation.Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that maintains cellular homeostasis under basal growth and stress conditions. In cancer  autophagy can either prevent or promote tumor growth  at early or advanced stages  respectively. We screened public databases to identify autophagy-related somatic mutations in cancer  using a computational approach to identify cancer mutational target sites  employing exact statistics. The top significant hit was a missense mutation (Y113C) in the MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) protein  which occurred at a significant frequency in cancer  and was detected in early stages in primary tumors of patients with known tumor lineage. The mutation reduced the formation of GFP-LC3B puncta and attenuated LC3B lipidation during Torin1-induced autophagy. Its effect on the direct physical interaction of LC3B with each of the 4 proteins that control its maturation or lipidation was tested by applying a protein-fragment complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Interactions with ATG4A and ATG4B proteases were reduced  yet without perturbing the cleavage of mutant LC3B. Most importantly  the mutation significantly reduced the interaction with the E1-like enzyme ATG7  but not the direct interaction with the E2-like enzyme ATG3  suggesting a selective perturbation in the binding of LC3B to some of its partner proteins. Structure analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of LC3B protein and its mutant suggest that the mutation changes the conformation of a loop that has several contact sites with ATG4B and the ATG7 homodimer. We suggest that this loss-of-function mutation  which attenuates autophagy  may promote early stages of cancer development.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oxidative stress induces downregulation of TP53INP2 and suppresses osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs during osteoporosis through the autophagy degradation pathway.Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and impaired bone formation. However  the mechanisms behind which oxidative stress represses bone formation remains unclear. TP53INP2  a target of the tumor suppressor p53  is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types including BMSCs and contributes to autophagosome formation by recruiting ubiquitinated substrates to autophagosomes for degradation. However  little is known about its function in BMSCs and its relation to osteoporosis. In this study  first  we verified that the expression of TP53INP2 was persistently decreased in BMSCs derived from osteoporosis patients and OVX mice  and that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine could ameliorate this decreased TP53INP2 level in vitro. Second  we identified that the mRNA and protein levels of TP53INP2 decreased in BMSCs under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner  with resultant co-location of LC3 and TP53INP2. Additionally  the autophagy-lysosome system was involved in the degradation process of TP53INP2 and applying autophagy inhibitors (Baf-A1) could significantly increase the TP53INP2 levels in murine and human BMSCs under oxidative stress. Third  gain- and loss-of-function assays revealed that knockdown of TP53INP2 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs  while overexpression of TP53INP2 promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. Further analysis demonstrated that TP53INP2 promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating Wnt/β-cantenin signaling. DKK1  an inhibitor of Wnt signaling  resulted in osteogenic defects of BMSCs that had over-expressed TP53INP2. Lithium  a Wnt/β-catenin activator  improved the mineralization ability in TP53INP2-knockdown BMSCs. Moreover  restoring TP53INP2 levels recovered OVX-derived BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and attenuated bone loss in OVX mice. Taken together  our study indicated that oxidative stress-induced downregulation of TP53INP2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs during osteoporosis and was mediated by the autophagy degradation pathway. These findings may introduce a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hydrogen Sulfide Attenuates High-Fat Diet-Induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Inhibiting Apoptosis and Promoting Autophagy via Reactive Oxygen Species/Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling Pathway.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease worldwide. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Nevertheless  the mechanism of action of H<sub>2</sub>S in NAFLD development has not been fully clarified. Here  the reduced level of H<sub>2</sub>S was observed in liver cells treated with oleic acid (OA). Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S increased the proliferation of OA-treated cells. The results showed that H<sub>2</sub>S decreased apoptosis and promoted autophagy through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade in OA-treated cells. In addition  administration of H<sub>2</sub>S relieved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD via inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of autophagy. These findings suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S could ameliorate HFD-induced NAFLD by regulating apoptosis and autophagy through ROS/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Novel H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing donors may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of NAFLD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Simvastatin Efficiently Reduces Levels of Alzheimer's Amyloid Beta in Yeast.A large-scale epidemiology study on statins previously showed that simvastatin was unique among statins in reducing the incidence of dementia. Since amyloid beta (Aβ42) is the protein that is most associated with Alzheimer's disease  this study has focused on how simvastatin influences the turnover of native Aβ42 and Aβ42 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP)  in the simplest eukaryotic model organism  <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Previous studies have established that yeast constitutively producing Aβ42 fused to GFP offer a convenient means of analyzing yeast cellular responses to Aβ42. Young cells clear the GFP fusion protein and do not have green fluorescence while the older population of cells retains the fusion protein and exhibits green fluorescence  offering a fast and convenient means of studying factors that affect Aβ42 turnover. In this study the proportion of cells having GFP fused to Aβ after exposure to simvastatin  atorvastatin and lovastatin was analyzed by flow cytometry. Simvastatin effectively reduced levels of the cellular Aβ42 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin promoted the greatest reduction as compared to the other two statins. A comparison with fluconazole  which targets that same pathway of ergosterol synthesis  suggests that effects on ergosterol synthesis do not account for the reduced amounts of Aβ42 fused to GFP. The levels of native Aβ42 following treated with simvastatin were also examined using a more laborious approach  quantitative MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Simvastatin efficiently reduced levels of native Aβ42 from the population. This work indicates a novel action of simvastatin in reducing levels of Aβ42 providing new insights into how simvastatin exerts its neuroprotective role. We hypothesize that this reduction may be due to protein clearance.,Autophagy_notLIR
miR-512-3p Overcomes Resistance to Cisplatin in Retinoblastoma by Promoting Apoptosis Induced by Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.BACKGROUND Retinoblastoma (RB) seriously endangers the vision and even the life of patients. This study aimed to explore the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and drug resistance of RB and verify the effect of miR-512-3p as a regulator of XBP-1 shearing mechanism on ERS  proliferation  apoptosis  and autophagy levels of RB cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS Y79  weri-RB1  and HXO-RB44 cells were treated with cisplatin (DDP) gradient concentration to construct DDP-resistant cells. The drug inhibition rate and cell proliferation were assessed by CCK-8 assay. The cell transfection and cell apoptosis were detected by RT-qPCR analysis and TUNEL assay  respectively. The protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the combination of miR-512-30p and XBP-1 transcript 1/2. RESULTS DDP inhibition rates for DDP-resistant RB cells were lower than that for RB cells. The XBP-1 expression was increased in DDP-resistant RB cells  and Y79 cells were chosen for the subsequent experiments. After transfection  miR-512-3p overexpression obviously inhibited the proliferation of DDP-resistant Y79 cells (Y79/DDP cells). miR-512-3p overexpression increased the DDP inhibition rate for Y79/DDP cells and apoptosis of Y79/DDP cells. miR-512-3p overexpression downregulated the expression of LC3 II/I in Y79/DDP cells. The effect of miR-512-3p inhibition on Y79/DDP cells was not as obvious as the effect of miR-512-3p overexpression on Y79/DDP cells. Furthermore  miR-512-3p was confirmed to be combined with XBP-1 transcript variant 1. CONCLUSIONS miR-512-3p improved the DDP resistance of RB cells by promoting ERS-induced apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation and autophagy of RB cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products Enhances the Cytotoxic Effect of Gemcitabine in Murine Pancreatic Tumors.Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a very difficult cancer to treat. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) by its ligands stimulates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Additional studies show that  in the RAGE ligand  the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein plays an important role in chemoresistance against the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine by promoting cell survival through increased autophagy. We hypothesized that blocking the RAGE/HMGB1 interaction would enhance the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine by reducing cell survival and autophagy. Using a preclinical mouse model of PDAC and a monoclonal antibody (IgG 2A11) as a RAGE inhibitor  we demonstrate that RAGE inhibition concurrent with gemcitabine treatment enhanced the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine. The combination of IgG 2A11 and gemcitabine resulted in decreased autophagy compared to treatment with gemcitabine combined with control antibodies. Notably  we also observed that RAGE inhibition protected against excessive weight loss during treatment with gemcitabine. Our data suggest that the combination of gemcitabine with a RAGE inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and needs to be further investigated.,Autophagy_notLIR
Long noncoding RNA UCA1 targets miR-582-5p and contributes to the progression and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells through ATG7-mediated autophagy inhibition.Rently  the incidence of bladder cancer has been on the rise.

Cigarette smoke exposure induces ROS-mediated autophagy by regulating sestrin  AMPK  and mTOR level in mice.Many pathological conditions linked to cigarette smoking are caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present study was conducted to analyze the effect of ROS on the lungs of Swiss mice exposed to cigarette smoking  focusing on autophagy-mediated mechanisms  and investigate the involvement of SESN2  AMPK  and mTOR signaling. Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for 7  15  30  45  and 60 days; the control group was not exposed to CS. Only mice exposed to CS for 45 days were selected for subsequent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation and smoke cessation analyses. Exposure to CS increased the production of ROS and induced molecular changes in the autophagy pathway  including an increase in phosphorylated AMPK and ULK1  reduction in phosphorylated mTOR  and increases in SESN2  ATG12  and LC3B levels. NAC supplementation reduced ROS levels and reversed all molecular changes observed upon CS treatment  suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in inducing autophagy upon CS exposure. When exposure to CS was stopped  there were decreases in the levels of oxidative stress  AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation  and autophagy-initiating molecules and increase in mTOR phosphorylation. In conclusion  these results suggest the involvement of ROS  SESN2  AMPK  and mTOR in the CS-induced autophagic process in the lung.,Autophagy_notLIR
Circular RNA hsa_circ_0000515 acts as a miR-326 sponge to promote cervical cancer progression through up-regulation of ELK1.This study investigates the role of circular RNA (circRNA) hsa_circ_0000515 in cervical cancer and the underlying mechanism associated with microRNA-326 (miR-326). hsa_circ_0000515 and ETS transcription factor ELK1 (ELK1) were initially over-expressed and miR-326 was down-regulated in cervical cancer tissues and cells. Low hsa_circ_0000515 expression was found to be associated with favorable prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. A series of mimics  inhibitors  over-expression plasmids or siRNAs were introduced into cervical cancer cells to alter the expression of hsa_circ_0000515  miR-326 and ELK1. <i>In vitro</i> experiments exhibited that silencing of hsa_circ_0000515 or upregulation of miR-326 resulted in suppressed proliferation and invasion  along with induced apoptosis and autophagy of cervical cancer cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay  RNA pull-down and RIP assays highlighted that hsa_circ_0000515 was able to act as a ceRNA of miR-326 to increase ELK1. Furthermore  enhancement of ELK1 expression resulted in enhanced proliferation and invasion but repressed apoptosis and autophagy of cervical cancer cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments further confirmed the suppressed tumor growth by hsa_circ_0000515 silencing. Our findings demonstrated that hsa_circ_0000515 acts as a tumor promoter in cervical cancer. The study provides evidence for targeting hsa_circ_0000515 for therapeutic purposes in treating cervical cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
A Bird's-Eye View of the Multiple Biochemical Mechanisms that Propel Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Advances and Mechanistic Perspectives on How to Halt the Disease Progression Targeting Multiple Pathways.Neurons consume the highest amount of oxygen  depend on oxidative metabolism for energy  and survive for the lifetime of an individual. Therefore  neurons are vulnerable to death caused by oxidative-stress  accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional proteins and organelles. There is an exponential increase in the number of patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) as the number of elderly increases exponentially. Development of AD pathology is a complex phenomenon characterized by neuronal death  accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles  and most importantly loss of memory and cognition. These pathologies are most likely caused by mechanisms including oxidative stress  mitochondrial dysfunction/stress  accumulation of misfolded proteins  and defective organelles due to impaired proteasome and autophagy mechanisms. Currently  there are no effective treatments to halt the progression of this disease. In order to treat this complex disease with multiple biochemical pathways involved  a complex treatment regimen targeting different mechanisms should be investigated. Furthermore  as AD is a progressive disease-causing morbidity over many years  any chemo-modulator for treatment must be used over long period of time. Therefore  treatments must be safe and non-interfering with other processes. Ideally  a treatment like medicinal food or a supplement that can be taken regularly without any side effect capable of reducing oxidative stress  stabilizing mitochondria  activating autophagy or proteasome  and increasing energy levels of neurons would be the best solution. This review summarizes progress in research on different mechanisms of AD development and some of the potential therapeutic development strategies targeting the aforementioned pathologies.,Autophagy_notLIR
GAPDH siRNA Regulates SH-SY5Y Cell Apoptosis Induced by Exogenous α-Synuclein Protein.The transport mechanism of intestinal α-synuclein to the central nervous system has become a new hot topic in Parkinson's disease (PD) research. It is worth noting that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. After silencing GAPDH expression by GAPDH siRNA  the normal human intestinal epithelial crypt-like (HIEC) and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines were co-cultured with Escherichia coli cells which were transfected with an α-synuclein overexpression plasmid. The levels of autophagy-related proteins (BECN1  ATG5  LC3A/B and p62) were determined by Western blot analysis. Changes in pro-apoptosis protein levels and flow cytometry analysis were used to assess cell apoptosis and relative intracellular ATP concentration was measured. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using 2' 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA)  thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)  and antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring the glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The silencing of the expression of GAPDH pre-knockdown was found to reduce the intracellular levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation  enhance autophagy activity  thereby reducing the cell injury  apoptosis and necrosis induced by exogenous α-synuclein protein in SH-SY5Y cells. This study identifies a new therapeutic target of exogenous α-synuclein protein induced SH-SY5Y cell injury and improves our understanding of the pathophysiological role of GAPDH in vitro.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Molecular pathways of autophagy regulation by BRCA1: Implications in cancer].The BRCA1 protein contributes to maintain genomic integrity  through transcriptional regulation of proteins that control the cell cycle and DNA repair or by direct interaction with these proteins. The genetic instability caused by mutations that result in a deficit of BRCA1 activity  confers an increased risk of mainly breast and ovarian cancers. In recent years  it has been shown that autophagy has a dual role in tumor development  and chemical agents such as lucanthone  chloroquine  Z-ligustilide  spautin-1  tunicamycin  T-12  and olaparib  regulate tumor survival/death autophagy-dependent. Here we also review the different molecular pathways by which BRCA1 regulates (mostly negatively) autophagy  mainly in breast and ovarian cancers  and where the cellular redox state (ROS  GSH) and proteins mTOR  p53-Mdm2  STAT3  and Parkin  have been shown to play an essential role.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysosomal dysfunction disturbs porcine oocyte maturation and developmental capacity by disorganizing chromosome/cytoskeleton and activating autophagy/apoptosis.Lysosome  an important organelle in eukaryotes  can sequester macromolecules submitted by the endocytosis and autophagy pathways for degradation and recycling. Massive macromolecular turnover is also vital to the growth and development of mammalian oocytes. However  the functional role of lysosomes in the meiotic maturation of mammalian oocytes remains largely unexplored. Here  by treating in vitro matured porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) with chloroquine (CQ)  a lysosome inhibitor  we showed that regardless of CQ concentration  lysosomal inhibition affected neither the extrusion of the first polar body (PB1)  nor the ROS levels. However  CQ treatment dramatically decreased the rates of oocytes with normal chromosome alignment and cytoskeleton organization (P < 0.05)  but boosted the rates of oocytes with apoptosis (P < 0.05). Subsequently  after pathenogenetic activation or in vitro fertilization  the death or fragmentation rates of oocytes treated by CQ (both 35 μM and 45 μM) were significantly higher (P < 0.05)  whereas the rates of embryo cleavage  embryos developed to blastocysts  and average blastomere number per blastocyst  were all significantly lower (P < 0.05)  respectively. Furthermore  CQ (35 μM) treatment activated the autophagy pathway by elevating the LC3 II/I ratio. Taken together  lysosomes could affect porcine oocyte maturation and subsequent developmental capacity partially through the chromosome organization/cytoskeleton assembly and autophagy/apoptosis pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
NIPSNAP1 and NIPSNAP2 Act as "Eat Me" Signals for Mitophagy.The clearance of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria by selective autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cellular homeostasis and prevention of disease. Our understanding of the mitochondrial signals that trigger their recognition and targeting by mitophagy is limited. Here  we show that the mitochondrial matrix proteins 4-Nitrophenylphosphatase domain and non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1 (NIPSNAP1) and NIPSNAP2 accumulate on the mitochondria surface upon mitochondrial depolarization. There  they recruit proteins involved in selective autophagy  including autophagy receptors and ATG8 proteins  thereby functioning as an "eat me" signal for mitophagy. NIPSNAP1 and NIPSNAP2 have a redundant function in mitophagy and are predominantly expressed in different tissues. Zebrafish lacking a functional Nipsnap1 display reduced mitophagy in the brain and parkinsonian phenotypes  including loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th1)-positive dopaminergic (DA) neurons  reduced motor activity  and increased oxidative stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
Assessment of Enrichment of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Based on Plasma and Mitochondrial Membrane Potentials.<b><i>Background:</i></b> Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are utilized preclinically and clinically as a candidate cell therapy for a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Despite promising results in early clinical trials  consistent outcomes with hMSC-based therapies have proven elusive in many of these applications. In this work  we attempt to address this limitation through the design of a stem cell therapy to enrich hMSCs for desired electrical and ionic properties with enhanced stemness and immunomodulatory/regenerative capacity. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> In this study  we sought to develop initial protocols to achieve electrically enriched hMSCs (EE-hMSCs) with distinct electrical states and assess the potential relationship with respect to hMSC state and function. We sorted hMSCs based on fluorescence intensity of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) and investigated phenotypic differences between the sorted populations. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Subpopulations of EE-hMSCs exhibit differential expression of genes associated with senescence  stemness  immunomodulation  and autophagy. EE-hMSCs with low levels of TMRE  indicative of depolarized membrane potential  have reduced mRNA expression of senescence-associated markers  and increased mRNA expression of autophagy and immunomodulatory markers relative to EE-hMSCs with high levels of TMRE (hyperpolarized). <b><i>Conclusions</i></b> : This work suggests that the utilization of EE-hMSCs may provide a novel strategy for cell therapies  enabling live cell enrichment for distinct phenotypes that can be exploited for different therapeutic outcomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nucleophagy-Implications for Microautophagy and Health.Nucleophagy  the selective subtype of autophagy that targets nuclear material for autophagic degradation  was not only shown to be a model system for the study of selective macroautophagy  but also for elucidating the role of the core autophagic machinery within microautophagy. Nucleophagy also emerged as a system associated with a variety of disease conditions including cancer  neurodegeneration and ageing. Nucleophagic processes are part of natural cell development  but also act as a response to various stress conditions. Upon releasing small portions of nuclear material  micronuclei  the autophagic machinery transfers these micronuclei to the vacuole for subsequent degradation. Despite sharing many cargos and requiring the core autophagic machinery  recent investigations revealed the aspects that set macro- and micronucleophagy apart. Central to the discrepancies found between macro- and micronucleophagy is the nucleus vacuole junction  a large membrane contact site formed between nucleus and vacuole. Exclusion of nuclear pore complexes from the junction and its exclusive degradation by micronucleophagy reveal compositional differences in cargo. Regarding their shared reliance on the core autophagic machinery  micronucleophagy does not involve normal autophagosome biogenesis observed for macronucleophagy  but instead maintains a unique role in overall microautophagy  with the autophagic machinery accumulating at the neck of budding vesicles.,Autophagy_notLIR
Herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion inhibits colonic autophagy in Crohn's disease <i>via</i> signaling involving distinct classes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved biological process in eukaryotic cells that involves lysosomal-mediated degradation and recycling of related cellular components. Recent studies have shown that autophagy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion (HM) has been historically practiced to treat CD. However  the mechanism by which HM regulates colonic autophagy in CD remains unclear.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-dependent cell death.Autophagy-dependent cell death can be defined as cell demise that has a strict requirement of autophagy. Although autophagy often accompanies cell death following many toxic insults  the requirement of autophagic machinery for cell death execution  as established through specific genetic or chemical inhibition of the process  is highly contextual. During animal development  perhaps the best validated model of autophagy-dependent cell death is the degradation of the larval midgut during larval-pupal metamorphosis  where a number of key autophagy genes are required for the removal of the tissues. Surprisingly though  even in the midgut  not all of the 'canonical' autophagic machinery appears to be required. In other organisms and cancer cells many variations of autophagy-dependent cell death are apparent  pointing to the lack of a unifying cell death pathway. It is thus possible that components of the autophagy machinery are selectively utilised or repurposed for this type of cell death. In this review  we discuss examples of cell death that utilise autophagy machinery (or part thereof)  the current knowledge of the complexity of autophagy-dependent cellular demise and the potential mechanisms and regulatory pathways involved in such cell death.,Autophagy_notLIR

Monitoring Mitophagy via the FRET Mechanism: Visualizing Mitochondria  Lysosomes  and Autolysosomes in Three Different Sets of Fluorescence Signals.Mitophagy is a vital biological process playing central roles in the regulation of metabolic activity and quality control of mitochondria. The presented dual-color fluorescent probes to directly monitor mitophagy were based on the optical response to pH change during mitophagy  but pH fluctuation may lead to interference. To overcome this  herein  two fluorescent probes (G-Mito  R-Lyso) were rationally designed to visualize mitophagy directly in a dual-color manner  relying on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process for the first time. Green emissive G-Mito targeted and anchored the mitochondria via reaction with protein thiols. Red-emissive R-Lyso exclusively targeted lysosomes. Live cells loaded with the two probes demonstrated strong fluorescence in only the green channel with excitation at 405 nm. After mitophagy  G-Mito in mitochondria was delivered into the lysosomes  and red fluorescence evidently increased due to the FRET process. With the probes  mitochondria  lysosomes  and autolysosomes could be discriminatively visualized in three different sets of signals. Mitophagy induced by starvation and in normal physiological status were successfully observed. The probes revealed that a certain amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could induce mitophagy. We expect that the two probes can serve as molecular tools for validation of mitophagy and promote the development of related areas.,Autophagy_notLIR

AQAMAN  a bisamidine-based inhibitor of toxic protein inclusions in neurons  ameliorates cytotoxicity in polyglutamine disease models.Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of an unstable <i>CAG</i> repeat in the coding region of the affected genes. Hallmarks of polyQ diseases include the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates  leading to neuronal degeneration and cell death. PolyQ diseases are currently incurable  highlighting the urgent need for approaches that inhibit the formation of disaggregate cytotoxic polyQ protein inclusions. Here  we screened for bisamidine-based inhibitors that can inhibit neuronal polyQ protein inclusions. We demonstrated that one inhibitor  AQAMAN  prevents polyQ protein aggregation and promotes de-aggregation of self-assembled polyQ proteins in several models of polyQ diseases. Using immunocytochemistry  we found that AQAMAN significantly reduces polyQ protein aggregation and specifically suppresses polyQ protein-induced cell death. Using a recombinant and purified polyQ protein (thioredoxin-Huntingtin-Q46)  we further demonstrated that AQAMAN interferes with polyQ self-assembly  preventing polyQ aggregation  and dissociates preformed polyQ aggregates in a cell-free system. Remarkably  AQAMAN feeding of <i>Drosophila</i> expressing expanded polyQ disease protein suppresses polyQ-induced neurodegeneration <i>in vivo</i> In addition  using inhibitors and activators of the autophagy pathway  we demonstrated that AQAMAN's cytoprotective effect against polyQ toxicity is autophagy-dependent. In summary  we have identified AQAMAN as a potential therapeutic for combating polyQ protein toxicity in polyQ diseases. Our findings further highlight the importance of the autophagy pathway in clearing harmful polyQ proteins.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sphingosine kinase-2 prevents macrophage cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis by stimulating autophagic lipid degradation.Atherosclerosis is the major cause of ischemic coronary heart diseases and characterized by the infiltration of cholesterol-accumulating macrophages in the vascular wall. Although sphingolipids are implicated in atherosclerosis as both membrane components and lipid mediators  the precise role of sphingolipids in atherosclerosis remains elusive. Here  we found that genetic deficiency of sphingosine kinase-2 (SphK2) but not SphK1 aggravates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in mice with ApoE deficiency. Bone marrow chimaera experiments show the involvement of SphK2 expressed in bone marrow-derived cells. In macrophages  deficiency of SphK2  a major SphK isoform in this cell type  results in increases in cellular sphingosine and ceramides. SphK2-deficient macrophages have increases in lipid droplet-containing autophagosomes and autolysosomes and defective lysosomal degradation of lipid droplets via autophagy with an impaired luminal acidic environment and proteolytic activity in the lysosomes. Transgenic overexpression of SphK1 in SphK2-deficient mice rescued aggravation of atherosclerosis and abnormalities of autophagosomes and lysosomes in macrophages with reductions of sphingosine  suggesting at least partial overlapping actions of two SphKs. Taken together  these results indicate that SphK2 is required for autophagosome- and lysosome-mediated catabolism of intracellular lipid droplets to impede the development of atherosclerosis; therefore  SphK2 may be a novel target for treating atherosclerosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Serum untargeted lipidomic profiling reveals dysfunction of phospholipid metabolism in subclinical coronary artery disease.<b>Purpose:</b> Disturbed metabolism of cholesterol and triacylglycerols (TGs) carries increased risk for coronary artery calcification (CAC). However  the exact relationship between individual lipid species and CAC remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify disturbances in lipid profiles involved in the calcification process  in an attempt to propose potential biomarker candidates. <b>Patients and methods:</b> We studied 70 patients at intermediate risk for coronary artery disease who had undergone coronary calcification assessment using computed tomography and Agatston coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were divided into three groups: with no coronary calcification (NCC; CACS: 0; n=26)  mild coronary calcification (MCC; CACS: 1-250; n=27)  or severe coronary calcification (SCC; CACS: >250; n=17). Patients' serum samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in an untargeted lipidomics approach. <b>Results:</b> We identified 103 lipids within the glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  sphingolipid  and sterol lipid classes. After false discovery rate correction  phosphatidylcholine (PC)(16:0/20:4) in higher levels and PC(18:2/18:2)  PC(36:3)  and phosphatidylethanolamine(20:0/18:2) in lower levels were identified as correlates with SCC compared to NCC. There were no significant differences in the levels of individual TGs between the three groups; however  clustering the lipid profiles showed a trend for higher levels of saturated and monounsaturated TGs in SCC compared to NCC. There was also a trend for lower TG(49:2)  TG(51:1)  TG(54:5)  and TG(56:8) levels in SCC compared to MCC. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this study we investigated the lipidome of patients with coronary calcification. Our results suggest that the calcification process may be associated with dysfunction in autophagy. The lipidomic biomarkers revealed in this study may aid in better assessment of patients with subclinical coronary artery disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
EM-2 inhibited autophagy and promoted G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis by activating the JNK pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of EM-2  a natural active monomer purified from Elephantopusmollis H.B.K.  on the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the molecular mechanism involved. The results from the MTT assay revealed that EM-2 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in a dose-dependent manner but exhibited less cytotoxicity to the normal liver epithelial cell line LO2. EdU staining and colony formation assays further confirmed the inhibitory effect of EM-2 on the proliferation of Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. According to the RNA sequencing and KEGG enrichment analysis results  EM-2 markedly activated the MAPK pathway in Huh-7 cells  and the results of Western blotting further indicated that EM-2 could activate the ERK and JNK pathways. Meanwhile  EM-2 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest in Huh-7 cells  which could be partially reversed when treated with SP600125  a JNK inhibitor. Further study indicated that EM-2 induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and blocked autophagic flux in Huh-7 cells by inhibiting autophagy-induced lysosome maturation. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 could reduce cell viability and increase the sensitivity of Huh-7 cells to EM-2. In conclusion  our findings revealed that EM-2 not only promoted G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and activated ER stress but also induced apoptosis by activating the JNK pathway and blocked autophagic flux by inhibiting autolysosome maturation in Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Therefore  EM-2 is a potential therapeutic drug with promising antitumor effects against hepatocellular carcinoma and fewer side effects.,Autophagy_notLIR
Radiosensitizing effects of curcumin alone or combined with GLUT1 siRNA on laryngeal carcinoma cells through AMPK pathway-induced autophagy.In this study  we investigated the ability of curcumin alone or in combination with GLUT1 siRNA to radiosensitize laryngeal carcinoma (LC) through the induction of autophagy. Protein levels in tumour tissues and LC cells were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In vitro  cell proliferation  colony formation assays  cell death and autophagy were detected. A nude mouse xenograft model was established through the injection of Tu212 cells. We found that GLUT1 was highly expressed and negatively associated with autophagy-related proteins in LC and that curcumin suppressed radiation-mediated GLUT1 overexpression in Tu212 cells. Treatment with curcumin  GLUT1 siRNA  or the combination of the two promoted autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using 6-amino-3-methypourine (3-MA) promoted apoptosis after irradiation or treatment of cells with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA. 3-MA inhibited curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA-mediated non-apoptotic programmed cell death. The combination of curcumin  GLUT1 siRNA and 3-MA provided the strongest sensitization in vivo. We also found that autophagy induction after curcumin or GLUT1 siRNA treatment implicated in the AMP-activated protein kinase-mTOR-serine/threonine-protein kinase-Beclin1 signalling pathway. Irradiation primarily caused apoptosis  and when combined with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA treatment  the increased radiosensitivity of LC occurred through the concurrent induction of apoptosis and autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apigenin induced autophagy and stimulated autophagic lipid degradation.Apigenin  as a natural flavonoid  has been proved to have many biological effects. Our previous research has found the antiadipogenic effects of apigenin on HepG2 cells. Autophagy is intimately associated with the metabolism of lipid droplets (LDs) and is considered to be one of the lipid breakdown pathways. However  there is no study to elucidate the lipid-lowering mechanism of apigenin from the perspective of autophagy. Here  we investigated the possible role of apigenin in autophagy and lipid accumulation in palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Our results showed that apigenin increased autophagosome formation and the LC3-II/I ratio  but decreased the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio and P62 protein expression. The effects of apigenin were blocked by chloroquine (CQ). Likewise  apigenin significantly stimulated autophagic flux in the cytoplasm. This effect also could be blocked by CQ. Moreover  apigenin decreased the lipid content and co-localization of LDs with LC3  and CQ could block these effects. Thus  we proposed that apigenin induced autophagy and stimulated autophagic lipid degradation in PA-treated HepG2 cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Electroacupuncture Pretreatment at Neiguan (PC6) attenuates autophagy in rats with myocardial ischemia reperfusion through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.To investigate the protective efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment at Neiguan (PC6) on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) in rats.,Autophagy_notLIR
The increased activity of a transcription factor inhibits autophagy in diabetic embryopathy.Maternal diabetes induces neural tube defects and stimulates the activity of the forkhead box O3 (Fox)O3a in the embryonic neuroepithelium. We previously demonstrated that deleting the FOXO3a gene ameliorates maternal diabetes-induced neural tube defects. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as "autophagy") is essential for neurulation. Rescuing autophagy suppressed by maternal diabetes in the developing neuroepithelium inhibits neural tube defect formation in diabetic pregnancy. This evidence suggests a possible link between FoxO3a and impaired autophagy in diabetic embryopathy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anti-Melanogenic Effects of Ethanol Extracts of the Leaves and Roots of <i>Patrinia villosa</i> (Thunb.) Juss through Their Inhibition of CREB and Induction of ERK and Autophagy.<i>Patrinia villosa</i> (Thunb.) Juss is a traditional herb commonly used in East Asia including Korea  Japan  and China. It has been administered to reduce and treat inflammation in Donguibogam  Korea. The mechanism for its anti-inflammatory effects has already been reported. In this study  we confirmed the efficacy of <i>Patrinia villosa</i> (Thunb.) Juss ethanol extract (Pv-EE) for inducing autophagy and investigate its anti-melanogenic properties. Melanin secretion and content were investigated using cells from the melanoma cell line B16F10. Pv-EE inhibited melanin in melanogenesis induced by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). The mechanism of inhibition of Pv-EE was confirmed by suppressing the mRNA of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)  decreasing the phosphorylation level of CREB  and increasing the phosphorylation of ERK. Finally  it was confirmed that Pv-EE induces autophagy through the autophagy markers LC3B and p62  and that the anti-melanogenic effect of Pv-EE is inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA). These results suggest that Pv-EE may be used as a skin protectant due to its anti-melanin properties including autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Polydatin induces apoptosis and autophagy via STAT3 signaling in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells.Polydatin  a natural product  is detected in many daily diets  such as grape juices and peanut. Autophagy regulation is recognized as a new potential strategy for cancer therapy  and previous studies demonstrated that polydatin showed remarkable anti-cancer ability. Nevertheless  the capability of polydatin to induce autophagy and its role in anti-osteosarcoma remains obscure. In this study  we investigated the anticancer effect of polydatin on human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 and its underlying mechanism. Our results indicated that polydatin significantly inhibited proliferation of MG-63 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner  and increased their apoptosis and autophagic flux. Further experiments showed that polydatin reduced the expression and phosphorylation (Y705) level of STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)  increased the expression of autophagy-related genes (Atg12  Atg14  BECN1  PIC3K3)  and therewith triggered autophagic cell death in MG-63 cells. Of note  the cytotoxicity effect of polydatin was rescued by co-treatment with Colivelin (STAT3 activator)  suggesting the dependency of MG-63 cells on STAT3 for survival in this process. Moreover  polydatin-triggered autophagy and apoptosis were remarkably reduced following exposure to autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine  while cell viability was increased. In conclusion  these data demonstrated that polydatin induced MG-63 cell death through inducing apoptosis  and autophagy which was mediated via the STAT3 signaling. Therefore  polydatin might be a potential clinical drug in the remedy of osteosarcoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
High-throughput identification of protein functional similarities using a gene-expression-based siRNA screen.A gene expression-based siRNA screen was used to evaluate functional similarity between genetic perturbations to identify functionally similar proteins. A siRNA library (siGenome library  Dharmacon) consisting of multiple siRNAs per gene that have been pooled in to one well per gene was arrayed in a 384-well format and used to individually target 14 335 proteins for depletion in HCT116 colon cancer cells. For each protein depletion  the gene expression of eight genes was quantified using the multiplexed Affymetrix Quantigene 2.0 assay in technical triplicate. As a proof of concept  six genes (BNIP3  NDRG1  ALDOC  LOXL2  ACSL5  BNIP3L) whose expression pattern reliably reflect the disruption of the molecular scaffold KSR1 were measured upon each protein depletion. The remaining two genes (PPIB and HPRT) are housekeeping genes used for normalization. The gene expression signatures from this screen can be used to estimate the functional similarity between any two proteins and successfully identified functional relationships for specific proteins such as KSR1 and more generalized processes  such as autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
5'-Hydroxy-6  7  8  3'  4'-pentamethoxyflavone extends longevity mediated by DR-induced autophagy and oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans.5'-Hydroxy-6  7  8  3'  4'-pentamethoxyflavone (5-HPF)  a polymethoxyflavone compound found in dikamali gum  has been shown to exert a range of beneficial effects on health. We have previously reported that 5-HPF improves the cholinergic dysfunction and also possesses antioxidant properties in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study  we have identified the effect of 5-HPF on the worm lifespan and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Out of the five tested pharmacological doses of 5-HPF  viz. 6.25  12.5  25  50  and 100 μM  the 50 μM dose maximally extended the mean life of C. elegans by 28%. The present study revealed that 5-HPF supplementation leads to dietary restriction (DR)-like effects in the worms without altering bacterial metabolism. The analysis of mutant animals fed with 5-HPF suggested that the extended lifespan of C. elegans depends upon multiple DR-related signaling pathways  with NRF2 and FOXA being critical factors. Further investigation into the mechanistic aspects indicated that 5-HPF utilizes autophagy pathway induced by DR through the upregulation of autophagy genes bec-1 and lgg-1  evident from the increase in autophagic puncta in the seam cells of lgg-1::gfp tagged worms. This study identifies the longevity-promoting activity of 5-HPF in C. elegans regulated by oxidative stress-resistance genes and DR-induced autophagy pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cationic amphiphilic drugs as potential anticancer therapy for bladder cancer.More effective therapy for patients with either muscle-invasive or high-risk non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is an unmet clinical need. For this  drug repositioning of clinically approved drugs represents an interesting approach. By repurposing existing drugs  alternative anticancer therapies can be introduced in the clinic relatively fast  because the safety and dosing of these clinically approved pharmacological agents are generally well known. Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) dose-dependently decreased the viability of a panel of human UCB lines in vitro. CADs induced lysosomal puncta formation  a hallmark of lysosomal leakage. Intravesical instillation of the CAD penfluridol in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model of human UCB resulted in significantly reduced intravesical tumor growth and metastatic progression. Furthermore  treatment of patient-derived ex vivo cultured human UCB tissue caused significant partial or complete antitumor responses in 97% of the explanted tumor tissues. In conclusion  penfluridol represents a promising treatment option for bladder cancer patients and warrants further clinical evaluation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mingmu Xiaomeng Tablets Restore Autophagy and Alleviate Diabetic Retinopathy by Inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling.<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effect of Mingmu Xiaomeng tablets (MMXM) on the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related proteins in a diabetic rat model. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control (NC)  diabetic model (DM) control  MMXM  and calcium dobesilate (CD) Rats injected with streptozotocin (STZ) were used as an experimental diabetes model. After 14 weeks  autophagy and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins were detected by western blot. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in Müller cells was examined by immunohistochemistry. Retinal function was evaluated with electroretinography  and retinal ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Serum cytokine levels were detected with protein chip technology. <b>Results:</b> MMXM restored autophagy by decreasing the protein expression of LC3-II and p62 and reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K  Akt  and mTOR  thus promoting autophagy. MMXM decreased GFAP expression in retinal Müller cells; restored electrophysiology indexes and retinal ultrastructures; and reduced serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β  IL-4  IL-6  tumor necrosis factor-α  and vascular endothelial growth factor. <b>Conclusion:</b> MMXM may protect the diabetic retina by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and enhancing autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate directly ameliorates liver fibrosis by inducing hepatic stellate cell apoptosis via downregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.Antifibrotic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis has not been developed so far. Long term treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with antiviral drugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) results in the regression of liver fibrosis  but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. Therefore  we aimed to investigate the direct impact of TDF and ETV on liver fibrosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
A small peptide inhibits siRNA amplification in plants by mediating autophagic degradation of SGS3/RDR6 bodies.Selective autophagy mediates specific degradation of unwanted cytoplasmic components to maintain cellular homeostasis. The suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)-formed bodies (SGS3/RDR6 bodies) are essential for siRNA amplification in planta. However  whether autophagy receptors regulate selective turnover of SGS3/RDR6 bodies is unknown. By analyzing the transcriptomic response to virus infection in Arabidopsis  we identified a virus-induced small peptide 1 (VISP1) composed of 71 amino acids  which harbor a ubiquitin-interacting motif that mediates interaction with autophagy-related protein 8. Overexpression of VISP1 induced selective autophagy and compromised antiviral immunity by inhibiting SGS3/RDR6-dependent viral siRNA amplification  whereas visp1 mutants exhibited opposite effects. Biochemistry assays demonstrate that VISP1 interacted with SGS3 and mediated autophagic degradation of SGS3/RDR6 bodies. Further analyses revealed that overexpression of VISP1  mimicking the sgs3 mutant  impaired biogenesis of endogenous trans-acting siRNAs and up-regulated their targets. Collectively  we propose that VISP1 is a small peptide receptor functioning in the crosstalk between selective autophagy and RNA silencing.,Autophagy_notLIR
Two distinct cellular pathways leading to endothelial cell cytotoxicity by silica nanoparticle size.Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are widely used for biosensing and diagnostics  and for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Safety concerns about the biomedical and clinical applications of SiNPs have been raised  necessitating analysis of the effects of their intrinsic properties  such as sizes  shapes  and surface physicochemical characteristics  on human health to minimize risk in biomedical applications. In particular  SiNP size-associated toxicological effects  and the underlying molecular mechanisms in the vascular endothelium remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying the cellular response to exposure to trace amounts of SiNPs and to determine applicable size criteria for biomedical application.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pristimerin enhances the effect of cisplatin by inhibiting the miR‑23a/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway and suppressing autophagy in lung cancer cells.Lung cancer is a common type of cancer with a high mortality rate in China. Cisplatin (Cis) is one of the most effective broad‑spectrum chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. However  Cis resistance remains an obstacle in the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Pristimerin (Pris)  a naturally occurring triterpenoid quinone compound  not only possesses anticancer properties  but also enhances chemosensitivity. Therefore  the present study aimed to investigate whether Pris can enhance the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells to Cis and identify the underlying mechanism. A Cell Counting kit‑8 and flow cytometry were used to determine cell viability  cell cycle progression and apoptosis in A549 and NCI‑H446 cells. Western blotting was used to determine cell apoptosis‑related  cell cycle‑related and autophagy‑related proteins. The results showed that Pris inhibited cell proliferation  and induced G0/G1 arrest and cell apoptosis in A549 and NCI‑H446 cells. The western blotting revealed that Pris effectively synergized with Cis to induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting the microRNA‑23a/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3β signaling pathway and suppressing autophagy. In vivo xenograft experiments confirmed that Pris effectively synergized with Cis to suppress tumor growth. Collectively  these results indicate that Pris synergized with Cis and that this may be a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome lung cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity.Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most popular and safe pain medications worldwide. However  due to its wide availability  it is frequently implicated in intentional or unintentional overdoses where it can cause severe liver injury and even acute liver failure (ALF). In fact  APAP toxicity is responsible for 46% of all ALF cases in the United States. Early mechanistic studies in mice demonstrated the formation of a reactive metabolite  which is responsible for hepatic glutathione depletion and initiation of the toxicity. This insight led to the rapid introduction of N-acetylcysteine as a clinical antidote. However  more recently  substantial progress was made in further elucidating the detailed mechanisms of APAP-induced cell death. Mitochondrial protein adducts trigger a mitochondrial oxidant stress  which requires amplification through a MAPK cascade that ultimately results in activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the cytosol and translocation of phospho-JNK to the mitochondria. The enhanced oxidant stress is responsible for the membrane permeability transition pore opening and the membrane potential breakdown. The ensuing matrix swelling causes the release of intermembrane proteins such as endonuclease G  which translocate to the nucleus and induce DNA fragmentation. These pathophysiological signaling mechanisms can be additionally modulated by removing damaged mitochondria by autophagy and replacing them by mitochondrial biogenesis. Importantly  most of the mechanisms have been confirmed in human hepatocytes and indirectly through biomarkers in plasma of APAP overdose patients. The extensive necrosis caused by APAP overdose leads to a sterile inflammatory response. Although recruitment of inflammatory cells is necessary for removal of cell debris in preparation for regeneration  these cells have the potential to aggravate the injury. This review touches on the newest insight into the intracellular mechanisms of APAP-induced cells death and the resulting inflammatory response. Furthermore  it discusses the translation of these findings to humans and the emergence of new therapeutic interventions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chlorophagy is ATG gene-dependent microautophagy process.Autophagy delivers cytosolic components to lysosomes and the vacuole for degradation. This pathway prevents starvation through bulk degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components  and maintains cellular homeostasis through selective elimination of damaged proteins and organelles. Autophagic delivery processes are categorized into three types: macroautophagy  microautophagy  and chaperone-mediated autophagy. During macroautophagy  nascent  double membrane-bound vesicles termed autophagosomes sequester a portion of cytoplasm and deliver it to the vacuole/lysosomes. Molecular genetic studies in budding yeasts have identified a set of AUTOPHAGY (ATG) genes required for autophagosome formation. Although microautophagy involves the direct lysosomal/vacuolar engulfment and incorporation of a target into the lumen rather than the formation of autophagosomes  the membrane dynamics and possible roles of ATGs during microautophagy are under investigation. Our recent study revealed an ATG-dependent microautophagy process in plants  during which chloroplasts damaged by high visible light (HL) are selectively eliminated. Here  we discuss the membrane dynamics of the plant microautophagy that enables the transport of whole chloroplasts into the vacuole.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular Mechanisms Linking ALS/FTD and Psychiatric Disorders  the Potential Effects of Lithium.Altered proteostasis  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress  abnormal unfolded protein response (UPR)  mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy impairment are interconnected events  which contribute to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In recent years  the mood stabilizer lithium was shown to potentially modify ALS/FTD beyond mood disorder-related pathology. The effects of lithium are significant in ALS patients carrying genetic variations in the UNC13 presynaptic protein  which occur in ALS/FTD and psychiatric disorders as well. In the brain  lithium modulates a number of biochemical pathways involved in synaptic plasticity  proteostasis  and neuronal survival. By targeting UPR-related events  namely ER stress  excitotoxicity and autophagy dysfunction  lithium produces plastic effects. These are likely to relate to neuroprotection  which was postulated for mood and motor neuron disorders. In the present manuscript  we try to identify and discuss potential mechanisms through which lithium copes concomitantly with ER stress  UPR and autophagy dysfunctions related to UNC13 synaptic alterations and aberrant RNA and protein processing. This may serve as a paradigm to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of ALS/FTD featuring early psychiatric disturbances.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chemotherapy-induced cachexia dysregulates hypothalamic and systemic lipoamines and is attenuated by cannabigerol.Muscle wasting  anorexia  and metabolic dysregulation are common side-effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy  having a dose-limiting effect on treatment efficacy  and compromising quality of life and mortality. Extracts of Cannabis sativa  and analogues of the major phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol  have been used to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced appetite loss and nausea for decades. However  psychoactive side-effects limit their clinical utility  and they have little efficacy against weight loss. We recently established that the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG) stimulates appetite in healthy rats  without neuromotor side-effects. The present study assessed whether CBG attenuates anorexia and/or other cachectic effects induced by the broad-spectrum chemotherapy agent cisplatin.,Autophagy_notLIR
Diabetic nephropathy: an insight into molecular mechanisms and emerging therapies.<b>Introduction</b>: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes and is the most common cause of proteinuric and non-proteinuric forms of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Control of risk factors such as blood glucose and blood pressure is not always achievable or effective. Significant research efforts have attempted to understand the pathophysiology of DKD and develop new therapies. <b>Areas covered</b>: We review DKD pathophysiology in the context of existing and emerging therapies that affect hemodynamic and metabolic pathways. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition has become standard care. Recent evidence for renoprotective activity of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists is an exciting step forward while endothelin receptor blockade shows promise. Multiple metabolic pathways of DKD have been evaluated with varying success; including mitochondrial function  reactive oxygen species  NADPH oxidase (NOX)  transcription factors (NF-B and Nrf2)  advanced glycation  protein kinase C (PKC)  aldose reductase  JAK-STAT  autophagy  apoptosis-signaling kinase 1 (ASK1)  fibrosis and epigenetics. <b>Expert opinion</b>: There have been major advances in the understanding and treatment of DKD. SGLT2i and GLP-1 agonists have demonstrated renoprotection  with novel therapies under evaluation. Addressing the interaction between hemodynamic and metabolic pathways may help achieve prevention  attenuation or even reversal of DKD.,Autophagy_notLIR
HSC70 expression is reduced in lymphomonocytes of sporadic ALS patients and contributes to TDP-43 accumulation.<i>Aim</i>: The demonstration that chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) contributes to the degradation of TDP-43  the main constituent of cytoplasmic inclusions typically found in motor neurons of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS)  has pointed out a possible involvement of CMA in aggregate formation. To explore this possibility  in this study  we verified the presence of a possible systemic CMA alteration in sALS patients and its effect on TDP-43 expression. <i>Materials and methods</i>: Gene and protein expression of the cytosolic chaperone HSC70 and the lysosome receptor LAMP2A  the two pivotal mediators of CMA  was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 30 sALS patients and 30 healthy controls. The expression of TDP-43 and co-chaperones BAG1 and BAG3 was also analyzed. <i>Results</i>: We found reduced HSC70 expression in patient cells  with no change in LAMP2A  and increased insoluble TDP-43 protein levels  with an aberrant intracellular localization. We also observed an unbalanced expression of co-chaperones BAG1 and BAG3. HSC70 down-regulation was confirmed in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from sporadic and TARDBP mutant ALS patients. Lastly  we demonstrated that HSC70 silencing directly increases TDP-43 protein levels in human neuroblastoma cells. <i>Discussion</i>: Our results do not support the existence of a systemic CMA alteration in sALS patients but indicate a direct involvement of HSC70 alterations in ALS pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR

α-Synuclein in Parkinson's disease: causal or bystander?Parkinson's disease (PD) comprises a spectrum of disorders with differing subtypes  the vast majority of which share Lewy bodies (LB) as a characteristic pathological hallmark. The process(es) underlying LB generation and its causal trigger molecules are not yet fully understood. α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of LB and SNCA gene missense mutations or duplications/triplications are causal for rare hereditary forms of PD. As typical sporadic PD is associated with LB pathology  a factor of major importance is the study of the α-syn protein and its pathology. α-Syn pathology is  however  also evident in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Lewy body disease (LBD)  making it non-specific for PD. In addition  there is an overlap of these α-synucleinopathies with other protein-misfolding diseases. It has been proven that α-syn  phosphorylated tau protein (pτ)  amyloid beta (Aβ) and other proteins show synergistic effects in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Multiple cell death mechanisms can induce pathological protein-cascades  but this can also be a reverse process. This holds true for the early phases of the disease process and especially for the progression of PD. In conclusion  while rare SNCA gene mutations are causal for a minority of familial PD patients  in sporadic PD (where common SNCA polymorphisms are the most consistent genetic risk factor across populations worldwide  accounting for 95% of PD patients) α-syn pathology is an important feature. Conversely  with regard to the etiopathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies PD  MSA and LBD  α-syn is rather a bystander contributing to multiple neurodegenerative processes  which overlap in their composition and individual strength. Therapeutic developments aiming to impact on α-syn pathology should take this fact into consideration.,Autophagy_notLIR
A risk signature with four autophagy-related genes for predicting survival of glioblastoma multiforme.Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating brain tumour without effective treatment. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for GBM. Therefore  it is necessary to identify novel biomarkers associated with autophagy in GBM. In this study  we downloaded autophagy-related genes from Human Autophagy Database (HADb) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) website. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify genes for constructing a risk signature. A nomogram was developed by integrating the risk signature with clinicopathological factors. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration plot were used to evaluate the efficiency of the prognostic model. Finally  four autophagy-related genes (DIRAS3  LGALS8  MAPK8 and STAM) were identified and were used for constructing a risk signature  which proved to be an independent risk factor for GBM patients. Furthermore  a nomogram was developed based on the risk signature and clinicopathological factors (IDH1 status  age and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy). ROC curve and calibration plot suggested the nomogram could accurately predict 1-  3- and 5-year survival rate of GBM patients. For function analysis  the risk signature was associated with apoptosis  necrosis  immunity  inflammation response and MAPK signalling pathway. In conclusion  the risk signature with 4 autophagy-related genes could serve as an independent prognostic factor for GBM patients. Moreover  we developed a nomogram based on the risk signature and clinical traits which was validated to perform better for predicting 1-  3- and 5-year survival rate of GBM.,Autophagy_notLIR
A discovery platform for the identification of caloric restriction mimetics with broad health-improving effects.The age-related decline in organismal fitness results in vulnerability to pathologies and eventual lethal decay. One way to counteract cellular aging and to delay and/or prevent the onset of age-related maladies is the reduction of calorie intake or the institution of fasting regimens. Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) have the ability to imitate the health-promoting and lifespan-extending effects of caloric restriction without the need for dietary restriction. CRMs induce an increase in autophagic flux in response to the deacetylation of cellular proteins in the absence of cytotoxicity. Here we report the development of a high-throughput discovery platform for novel CRMs that uses systems biology approaches  in vitro validation and functional tests employing in vivo disease models. This workflow led to the identification of 3 4-dimethoxychalcone (3 4-DC) as a novel CRM that stimulated TFEB (transcription factor EB)- and TFE3 (transcription factor E3)-dependent macroautophagy/autophagy. 3 4-DC showed cardioprotective effects and stimulated anticancer immunosurveillance in the context of immunogenic chemotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in Hematological Malignancies: Molecular Aspects in Leukemia and Lymphoma.The organization of the hematopoietic system is dependent on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation to produce different blood cell lines. Autophagy has a central role in energy production and metabolism of the cells during starvation  cellular stress adaption  and removing mechanisms for aged or damaged organelles. The role and importance of autophagy pathways are becoming increasingly recognized in the literature because these pathways can be useful in organizing intracellular circulation  molecular complexes  and organelles to meet the needs of various hematopoietic cells. There is supporting evidence in the literature that autophagy plays an emerging role in the regulation of normal cells and that it also has important features in malignant hematopoiesis. Understanding the molecular details of the autophagy pathway can provide novel methods for more effective treatment of patients with leukemia. Overall  our review will emphasize the role of autophagy and its different aspects in hematological malignant neoplasms.,Autophagy_notLIR
SQSTM1/p62 and PPARGC1A/PGC-1alpha at the interface of autophagy and vascular senescence.Defective macroautophagy/autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are known to stimulate senescence. The mitochondrial regulator PPARGC1A (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma  coactivator 1 alpha) regulates mitochondrial biogenesis  reducing senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however  it is unknown whether autophagy mediates PPARGC1A-protective effects on senescence. Using <i>ppargc1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> VSMCs  we identified the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) as a major regulator of autophagy and senescence of VSMCs. Abnormal autophagosomes were observed in VSMCs in aortas of <i>ppargc1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. <i>ppargc1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> VSMCs in culture presented reductions in LC3-II levels; in autophagosome number; and in the expression of SQSTM1 (protein and mRNA)  LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2)  CTSD (cathepsin D)  and TFRC (transferrin receptor). Reduced SQSTM1 protein expression was also observed in aortas of <i>ppargc1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and was upregulated by PPARGC1A overexpression  suggesting that SQSTM1 is a direct target of PPARGC1A. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA (3 methyladenine)  spautin-1 or <i>Atg5</i> (autophagy related 5) siRNA stimulated senescence. Rapamycin rescued the effect of <i>Atg5</i> siRNA in <i>Ppargc1a<sup>+/+</sup></i>   but not in <i>ppargc1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> VSMCs  suggesting that other targets of MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)  in addition to autophagy  also contribute to senescence. <i>Sqstm1</i> siRNA increased senescence basally and in response to AGT II (angiotensin II) and zinc overload  two known inducers of senescence. Furthermore  <i>Sqstm1 </i>gene deficiency mimicked the phenotype of <i>Ppargc1a</i> depletion by presenting reduced autophagy and increased senescence <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Thus  PPARGC1A upregulates autophagy reducing senescence by a SQSTM1-dependent mechanism. We propose SQSTM1 as a novel target in therapeutic interventions reducing senescence.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lipid droplets and autophagy-links and regulations from yeast to humans.Recent advances in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes have been increasingly connecting lipid droplet (LD) dynamics to the regulation of autophagy. In this review we will discuss implications that connect LD de novo synthesis and LD mobilization to autophagy and how autophagy is regulated by these mechanisms. Elucidating these connections might pose a chance to further understand autophagy induction and membrane biogenesis for the growing autophagosome under different conditions. Increasing our understanding of these mechanisms might provide a chance to understand several conditions that might be related to LD dysregulation and  possibly  as a consequence of this  dysregulation of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
High Surface Reactivity and Biocompatibility of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs in Human MCF-7 Epithelial and HT-1080 FibroBlast Cells.This study aimed to generate a comparative data on biological response of yttrium oxide nanoparticles (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs) with the antioxidant CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs and pro-oxidant ZnO NPs. Sizes of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs were found to be in the range of 35±10 nm as measured by TEM and were larger from its hydrodynamic sizes in water (1004 ± 134 nm)  PBS (3373 ± 249 nm)  serum free culture media (1735 ± 305 nm) and complete culture media (542 ± 108 nm). Surface reactivity of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was found significantly higher than for CeO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO NPs. The displacement studies clearly suggested that adsorption to either BSA  filtered serum or serum free media was quite stable  and was dependent on whichever component interacted first with the Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs. Enzyme mimetic activity  like that of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs  was not detected for the NPs of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or ZnO. Cell viability measured by MTT and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays suggested Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs were not toxic in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and fibroblast HT-1080 cells up to the concentration of 200 μg/mL for a 24 h treatment period. Oxidative stress markers suggested Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs to be tolerably non-oxidative and biocompatible. Moreover  mitochondrial potential determined by JC-1 as well as lysosomal activity determined by lysotracker (LTR) remained un-affected and intact due to Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs whereas  as expected  were significantly induced by ZnO NPs. Hoechst-PI dual staining clearly suggested apoptotic potential of only ZnO NPs. With high surface reactivity and biocompatibility  NPs of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> could be a promising agent in the field of nanomedicine.,Autophagy_notLIR

Focus on the Use of Resveratrol as an Adjuvant in Glioblastoma Therapy.Glioblastoma (GB) represents the most common and malignant form of glioma cancer. The Gold Standard in Glioblastoma is neurosurgical tumor removal and radiotherapy treatment in concomitant with temozolomide (TMZ). Unfortunately  because of tumor chemo and radio-resistance during this therapy  the patient's outcome remains very poor  with a median overall survival of about 14.6 months. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol with a stilbene structure with chemopreventive and anticancer properties. In the present review  we evaluated data from preclinical studies conducted with resveratrol as a possible adjuvant during the standard protocol of GB. Resveratrol can reach the brain parenchyma at sub-micromolar concentrations when administrated through conventional routes. In this way  resveratrol reduces cell invasion and increases the efficacy of radiotherapy (radiosensitizer effects) and temozolomide. The molecular mechanism of the adjuvant action of resveratrol may depend upon the reduction of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB axis and downstream targets O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). It has been reported that redox signaling plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy. Resveratrol administration by External Carotid Artery (ECA) injection or by Lumbar Puncture (LP) can reach micromolar concentrations in tumor mass where it would inhibit tumor growth by STAT-3 dependent mechanisms. Preclinical evidences indicate a positive effect on the use of resveratrol as an adjuvant in anti-GB therapy. Ameliorated formulations of resveratrol with a favorable plasmatic profile for a better brain distribution and timing sequences during radio and chemotherapy could represent a critical aspect for resveratrol use as an adjuvant for a clinical evaluation.,Autophagy_notLIR
The kinase inhibitor SI113 induces autophagy and synergizes with quinacrine in hindering the growth of human glioblastoma multiforme cells.Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  due to its location  aggressiveness  heterogeneity and infiltrative growth  is characterized by an exceptionally dismal clinical outcome. The small molecule SI113  recently identified as a SGK1 inhibitor  has proven to be effective in restraining GBM growth in vitro and in vivo  showing also encouraging results when employed in combination with other antineoplastic drugs or radiotherapy. Our aim was to explore the pharmacological features of SI113 in GBM cells in order to elucidate the pivotal molecular pathways affected by the drug. Such knowledge would be of invaluable help in conceiving a rational offensive toward GBM.,Autophagy_notLIR
Can ovarian aging be delayed by pharmacological strategies?Aging has been regarded as a treatable condition  and delaying aging could prevent some diseases. Ovarian aging  a special type of organ senescence  is the earliest-aging organ  as ovaries exhibit an accelerated rate of aging with characteristics of gradual declines in ovarian follicle quantity and quality since birth  compared to other organs. Ovarian aging is considered as the pacemaker of female body aging  which drives the aging of multiple organs of the body. Hence  anti-ovarian aging has become a research topic broadly interesting to both biomedical scientists and pharmaceutical industry. A marked progress has been made in exploration of possible anti-ovarian agents or approaches  such as calorie restriction mimetics  antioxidants  autophagy inducers etc.  over the past years. This review is attempted to discuss recent advances in the area of anti-ovarian aging pharmacology and to offer new insights into our better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian aging  which might be informative for future prevention and treatment of ovarian aging and its related diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
MdHARBI1  a MdATG8i-interacting protein  plays a positive role in plant thermotolerance.Autophagy is a major degradation pathway in plants for maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to various environmental stressors. ATG8 is one of a series of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and plays a central role in both bulk and selective autophagy. Previously  we characterized MdATG8i in apple and demonstrated that it has a positive role in apple stress resistance. Although many ATG8-interacting proteins have been found in Arabidopsis  no protein has been reported to interact with MdATG8 in apple. Here  we identified MdHARBI1 as a MdATG8i-interacting protein in apple  however  the functions of HARBI1-like proteins have not been explored in plants. Expression analysis of MdHARBI1 and pro-MdHARBI1-GUS staining of transgenic Arabidopsis exposed to high temperature demonstrated that MdHARBI1 was significantly induced by heat stress. Moreover  heat-treated MdHARBI1-trangenic tomato plants maintained higher autophagic activity  accumulated fewer ROS  and displayed stronger chlorophyll fluorescence than wild-type plants. Because these phenotypes were consistent with those displayed by MdATG8i-overexpressing apple plants under high temperature  we concluded that the MdATG8i-interacting protein MdHARBI1 plays a critical role in the basal thermotolerance of plants  mainly by influencing autophagy pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chimera induced protein degradation: PROTACs and beyond.Ubiquitin-proteasome system  autophagy-lysosome pathway and N-end rule pathway are crucial protein quality control mechanisms in human body. Hijacking these endogenous protein degrading measures by chimera degraders could be a revolutionary strategy for the discovery of small-molecule drugs. As the most advanced chimera degraders  PROTACs have demonstrated the potential by delivering two drug candidates into clinical trials. The development of chimera degraders exploiting these three pathways are reviewed  a focus is given on the chemical structures and their influences on biological effects from a viewpoint of medicinal chemistry.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibition enhances autophagy and attenuates early-stage post-spinal cord injury apoptosis.Neuron death in spinal cords is caused primarily by apoptosis after spinal cord injury (SCI). Autophagy can act as a cellular response to maintain neuron homeostasis that can reduce apoptosis. Although more studies have shown that an epigenetic enzyme called Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) can negatively regulate autophagy during cancer research  existing research does not focus on impacts related to LSD1 in nerve injury diseases. This study was designed to determine whether inhibiting LSD1 could enhance autophagy against apoptosis and provide effective neuroprotection in vitro and vivo after SCI. The results showed that LSD1 inhibition treatment significantly reduced spinal cord damage in SCI rat models and was characterized by upregulated autophagy and downregulated apoptosis. Further research demonstrated that using both pharmacological inhibition and gene knockdown could enhance autophagy and reduce apoptosis for in vitro simulation of SCI-caused damage models. Additionally  3-methyladenine (3-MA) could partially eliminate the effect of autophagy enhancement and apoptosis suppression. These findings demonstrated that LSD1 inhibition could protect against SCI by activating autophagy and hindering apoptosis  suggesting a potential candidate for SCI therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The "found-art vacuole"-people learn in different ways.Based on my reading  and on my own experience  I have come to realize that people learn in different ways  and this can include the use of different media. This is one reason I have worked with various artists to portray the topic of autophagy through paintings  music and dance. Indeed  comments from members of the audience who have attended one of my seminars often suggest that a particular artistic approach 'hit home' and added meaning to them about the topic. In this issue of the journal I describe another such project-'the-found-art vacuole'-that utilized the talents of an amazing watercolor painter  Scott Hartley. The object of Scott's painting is the only artophagy composition that I have 'made'-assembled is a more accurate word. Doing so was quite fun  but after examining many of the 'antique' items that form the 'found-art vacuole'  I realized that it would be nice to have a painting that was done in exquisite detail. The requirement for detail immediately made me think of Scott  whose work I was familiar with from the Ann Arbor Art Fair. To quote a line from the Belleville News-Democrat describing Scott's taking first place in an art competition  'He began by doing landscapes  and eventually found a different style for his work: the intricacies of urban architecture  of alleys and fire escapes in a city neighborhood.' This does describe the nature of Scott's work  but you have to see these paintings to appreciate the detail.,Autophagy_notLIR

Pros and cons of different ways to address dysfunctional autophagy in Pompe disease.Autophagy is a major intracellular self-digestion process that brings cytoplasmic materials to the lysosome for degradation. Defective autophagy has been linked to a broad range of human disorders  including cancer  diabetes  neurodegeneration  autoimmunity  cardiovascular diseases  and myopathies. In Pompe disease  a severe neuromuscular disorder  disturbances in autophagic process manifest themselves as progressive accumulation of undegraded cellular debris in the diseased muscle cells. A growing body of evidence has connected this defect to the decline in muscle function and muscle resistance to the currently available treatment-enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Both induction and inhibition of autophagy have been tested in pre-clinical studies in a mouse model of the disease. Here  we discuss strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to address autophagic dysfunction in the context of Pompe disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) Promotes the EMT of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Stimulating Autophagic Degradation of E-Cadherin.EMT is a pivotal mechanism involved in tumor metastasis  which is the leading cause of poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sirtuin family members function as NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases that are essential for tumor metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However  no causal association has been established between Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) and HCC metastasis. SIRT6 expression pattern and its association with HCC metastasis were investigated by informatic analysis  and verified by qRT-PCR and immunochemistry in HCC tissues. Transwell assay  qRT-PCR  and immunofluorescence assay were utilized to assess the effects of SIRT6 on metastasis and E-cadherin expression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Immunoprecipitation assay was performed to observe whether SIRT6 deacetylated Beclin-1 in HCC cells. Immunofluorescence assay and inhibitor treatment rescue experiments were used to clarify the mechanism by which SIRT6 facilitated EMT and metastasis. SIRT6 upregulation was quite prevalent in HCC tissues and closely correlated with worse overall survival  disease-relapse free survival  and HCC metastasis. Furthermore  SIRT6 promoted HCC cell migration  invasion  and EMT. Mechanistically  we found that SIRT6 deacetylated Beclin-1 in HCC cells and this event led to the promotion of the autophagic degradation of E-cadherin. Noticeably  E-cadherin degradation and invasion  migration induced by SIRT6 overexpression could be rescued by dual mutation of <i>Beclin-1</i> (inhibition of acetylation)  CQ (autophagy inhibitor)  and knockdown of Atg7. In addition  SIRT6 promoted N-cadherin and Vimentin expression via deacetylating FOXO3a in HCC. These results established a relationship between SIRT6 and HCC EMT and further elucidated the mechanisms underlying HCC metastasis  helping provide a promising approach for the treatment of HCC. IMPLICATIONS: Inhibiting SIRT6 represents a potential therapeutic approach to suppress HCC metastasis partially through reduction of autophagic degradation of E-cadherin.,Autophagy_notLIR
The mitochondrial fission factor FIS1 promotes stemness of human lung cancer stem cells via mitophagy.Mitophagy  a form of autophagy  plays a role in cancer development  progression and recurrence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) also play a key role in these processes  although it not known whether mitophagy can regulate the stemness of CSCs. Here  we employed the A549-SD human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma CSC model that we have developed and characterized to investigate the effect of mitophagy on the stemness of CSCs. We observed a positive relationship between mitophagic activity and the stemness of lung CSCs. At the mechanistic level  our results suggest that augmentation of mitophagy in lung CSCs can be induced by FIS1 through mitochondrial fission. In addition  we assessed the clinical relevance of FIS1 in lung adenocarcinoma using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. An elevation in FIS1  when observed together with other prognostic markers for lung cancer progression  was found to correlate with shorter overall survival.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of GOLPH3 and TPX2 in Neuroblastoma DNA Damage Response and Cell Resistance to Chemotherapy.Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive  relapse-prone infancy tumor of the sympathetic nervous system and is the leading cause of death among preschool age diseases  so the search for novel therapeutic targets is crucial. Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been reported to be involved in the development  and in the DNA damage response  of various human cancers. Golgi dispersal is a common feature of DNA damage response in mammalian cells. Understanding how cells react to DNA damage is essential in order to recognize the systems used to escape from elimination. We induced DNA damage in two human neuroblastoma cell lines by curcumin. The exposure of neuroblastoma cells to curcumin induced: (a) up-regulation of GOLPH3<sup>+</sup> cells; (b) augmentation of double-strand breaks; (c) Golgi fragmentation and dispersal throughout the cytoplasm; (d) increase of apoptosis and autophagy; (e) increased expression of TPX2 oncoprotein  able to repair DNA damage. Primary neuroblastoma samples analysis confirmed these observations. Our findings suggest that GOLPH3 expression levels may represent a clinical marker of neuroblastoma patients' responsiveness to DNA damaging therapies-and of possible resistance to them. Novel molecules able to interfere with GOLPH3 and TPX2 pathways may have therapeutic benefits when used in combination with standard DNA damaging therapeutic agents in neuroblastoma.,Autophagy_notLIR

Deep morphological analysis of muscle biopsies from type III glycogenesis (GSDIII)  debranching enzyme deficiency  revealed stereotyped vacuolar myopathy and autophagy impairment.Glycogen storage disorder type III (GSDIII)  or debranching enzyme (GDE) deficiency  is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by variable liver  cardiac  and skeletal muscle involvement. GSDIII manifests with liver symptoms in infancy and muscle involvement during early adulthood. Muscle biopsy is mainly performed in patients diagnosed in adulthood  as routine diagnosis relies on blood or liver GDE analysis  followed by AGL gene sequencing. The GSDIII mouse model recapitulate the clinical phenotype in humans  and a nearly full rescue of muscle function was observed in mice treated with the dual AAV vector expressing the GDE transgene.In order to characterize GSDIII muscle morphological spectrum and identify novel disease markers and pathways  we performed a large international multicentric morphological study on 30 muscle biopsies from GSDIII patients. Autophagy flux studies were performed in human muscle biopsies and muscles from GSDIII mice. The human muscle biopsies revealed a typical and constant vacuolar myopathy  characterized by multiple and variably sized vacuoles filled with PAS-positive material. Using electron microscopy  we confirmed the presence of large non-membrane bound sarcoplasmic deposits of normally structured glycogen as well as smaller rounded sac structures lined by a continuous double membrane containing only glycogen  corresponding to autophagosomes. A consistent SQSTM1/p62 decrease and beclin-1 increase in human muscle biopsies suggested an enhanced autophagy. Consistent with this  an increase in the lipidated form of LC3  LC3II was found in patients compared to controls. A decrease in SQSTM1/p62 was also found in the GSDIII mouse model.In conclusion  we characterized the morphological phenotype in GSDIII muscle and demonstrated dysfunctional autophagy in GSDIII human samples.These findings suggest that autophagic modulation combined with gene therapy might be considered as a novel treatment for GSDIII.,Autophagy_notLIR
Gliotoxin Enhances Autophagic Cell Death via the DAPK1-TAp63 Signaling Pathway in Paclitaxel-Resistant Ovarian Cancer Cells.Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) expression induced by diverse death stimuli mediates apoptotic activity in various cancers  including ovarian cancer. In addition  mutual interaction between the tumor suppressor p53 and DAPK1 influences survival and death in several cancer cell lines. However  the exact role and connection of DAPK1 and p53 family proteins (p53  p63  and p73) in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells have not been studied previously. In this study  we investigated whether DAPK1 induction by gliotoxin derived from marine fungus regulates the level of transcriptionally active p63 (TAp63) to promote apoptosis in an autophagy-dependent manner. Pre-exposure of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells to gliotoxin inhibited the expression of multidrug resistant-associated proteins (MDR1 and MRP1-3)  disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential  and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through autophagy induction after subsequent treatment with paclitaxel. Gene silencing of DAPK1 prevented TAp63-mediated downregulation of MDR1 and MRP1-3 and autophagic cell death after sequential treatment with gliotoxin and then paclitaxel. However  pretreatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA)  an autophagy inhibitor  had no effect on the levels of DAPK1 and TAp63 or on the inhibition of MDR1 and MRP1-3. These results suggest that DAPK1-mediated TAp63 upregulation is one of the critical pathways that induce apoptosis in chemoresistant cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
MicroRNAs as the critical regulators of cisplatin resistance in gastric tumor cells.Combined chemotherapeutic treatment is the method of choice for advanced and metastatic gastric tumors. However  resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is one of the main challenges for the efficient gastric cancer (GC) treatment. Cisplatin (CDDP) is used as an important regimen of chemotherapy for GC which induces cytotoxicity by interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells and inducing their apoptosis. Majority of patients experience cisplatin-resistance which is correlated with tumor metastasis and relapse. Moreover  prolonged and high-dose cisplatin administrations cause serious side effects such as nephrotoxicity  ototoxicity  and anemia. Since  there is a high rate of recurrence after CDDP treatment in GC patients; it is required to clarify the molecular mechanisms associated with CDDP resistance to introduce novel therapeutic methods. There are various cell and molecular processes associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) including drug efflux  detoxification  DNA repair ability  apoptosis alteration  signaling pathways  and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in chemo resistance of GC cells through regulation of all of the MDR mechanisms. In present review we have summarized all of the miRNAs associated with cisplatin resistance based on their target genes and molecular mechanisms in gastric tumor cells. This review paves the way of introducing a miRNA-based panel of prognostic markers to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and clinical outcomes in GC patients. It was observed that miRNAs are mainly involved in cisplatin response of gastric tumor cells via regulation of signaling pathways  autophagy  and apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
The critical roles of protein quality control systems in the pathogenesis of heart failure.Heart failure is a refractory disease with a prevalence that has continuously increased around the world. Over the past decade  we have made remarkable progress in the treatment of heart failure  including drug therapies  device therapies  and regeneration therapies. However  as each of these heart failure therapies does not go much beyond symptomatic therapy  there is a compelling need to establish novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure in a fundamental way. As cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells  protein quality control is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis  optimal performance  and longevity. There are five evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for ensuring protein quality control in cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome system  autophagy  the unfolded protein response  SUMOylation  and NEDDylation. Recent research has clarified the molecular mechanism underlying how these processes degrade misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in cardiomyocytes. In addition  a growing body of evidence suggests that deviation from appropriate levels of protein quality control causes cellular dysfunction and death  which in turn leads to heart failure. We herein review recent advances in understanding the role of protein quality control systems in heart disease and discuss the therapeutic potential of modulating protein quality control systems in the human heart.,Autophagy_notLIR
Visualization of Endogenous Mitophagy Complexes In Situ in Human Pancreatic Beta Cells Utilizing Proximity Ligation Assay.Mitophagy is an essential mitochondrial quality control pathway  which is crucial for pancreatic islet beta cell bioenergetics to fuel glucose-stimulated insulin release. Assessment of mitophagy is challenging and often requires genetic reporters or multiple complementary techniques not easily utilized in tissue samples  such as primary human pancreatic islets. Here we demonstrate a robust approach to visualize and quantify formation of key endogenous mitophagy complexes in primary human pancreatic islets. Utilizing the sensitive proximity ligation assay technique to detect interaction of the mitophagy regulators NRDP1 and USP8  we are able to specifically quantify formation of essential mitophagy complexes in situ. By coupling this approach to counterstaining for the transcription factor PDX1  we can quantify mitophagy complexes  and the factors that can impair mitophagy  specifically within beta cells. The methodology we describe overcomes the need for large quantities of cellular extracts required for other protein-protein interaction studies  such as immunoprecipitation (IP) or mass spectrometry  and is ideal for precious human islet samples generally not available in sufficient quantities for these approaches. Further  this methodology obviates the need for flow sorting techniques to purify beta cells from a heterogeneous islet population for downstream protein applications. Thus  we describe a valuable protocol for visualization of mitophagy highly compatible for use in heterogeneous and limited cell populations.,Autophagy_notLIR
More than a Pore: Nonlytic Antimicrobial Functions of Complement and Bacterial Strategies for Evasion.The complement system is an evolutionarily ancient defense mechanism against foreign substances. Consisting of three proteolytic activation pathways  complement converges on a common effector cascade terminating in the formation of a lytic pore on the target surface. The classical and lectin pathways are initiated by pattern recognition molecules binding to specific ligands  while the alternative pathway is constitutively active at low levels in circulation. Complement-mediated killing is essential for defense against many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens  and genetic deficiencies in complement can render individuals highly susceptible to infection  for example  invasive meningococcal disease. In contrast  Gram-positive bacteria are inherently resistant to the direct bactericidal activity of complement due to their thick layer of cell wall peptidoglycan. However  complement also serves diverse roles in immune defense against all bacteria by flagging them for opsonization and killing by professional phagocytes  synergizing with neutrophils  modulating inflammatory responses  regulating T cell development  and cross talk with coagulation cascades. In this review  we discuss newly appreciated roles for complement beyond direct membrane lysis  incorporate nonlytic roles of complement into immunological paradigms of host-pathogen interactions  and identify bacterial strategies for complement evasion.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cellular Proteostasis in Neurodegeneration.The term proteostasis reflects the fine-tuned balance of cellular protein levels  mediated through a vast network of biochemical pathways. This requires the regulated control of protein folding  post-translational modification  and protein degradation. Due to the complex interactions and intersection of proteostasis pathways  exposure to stress conditions may lead to a disruption of the entire network. Incorrect protein folding and/or modifications during protein synthesis results in inactive or toxic proteins  which may overload degradation mechanisms. Further  a disruption of autophagy and the endoplasmic reticulum degradation pathway may result in additional cellular stress which could ultimately lead to cell death. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease  Alzheimer's disease  Huntington's disease  and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis all share common risk factors such as oxidative stress  aging  environmental stress  and protein dysfunction; all of which alter cellular proteostasis. The differing pathologies observed in neurodegenerative diseases are determined by factors such as location-specific neuronal death  source of protein dysfunction  and the cell's ability to counter proteotoxicity. In this review  we discuss how the disruption in cellular proteostasis contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Current research analysis and prospects on sensitization effect of artesunate on anti-cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy].The wide application of artemisinins in the treatment of multiple cancers reflects the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine used in this field. The existing basic and clinical studies have revealed that artesunate can effectively suppress the malignant progression of breast cancer colon cancer leukemia melanoma ovarian cancer prostate cancer kidney cancer and various tumors in central nervous system. The pharmacological mechanisms of artesunate against cancers are reflected in many aspects such as inhibiting tumor cell proliferation invasion and metastasis inducing tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy regulating cell signal transduction and inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Meanwhile growing experimental evidences have indicated that artesunate has been used for the sensitization of radiotherapy with X-ray β-ray γ-ray and~(60)Co γ-ray as well as chemotherapy with cisplatin carboplatin and doxorubicin.This review collected basic and clinical studies on the sensitization effect of artesunate on anti-cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy published on PubMed and CNKI during April 2000 and February 2019 and summarized the clinical positioning and application of artesunate with the aim to provide a more comprehensive explanation on the sensitization effect of artesunate on anti-cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy and offer the inspiration and ideas for the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy sensitizers as well as cancer resistance reversal agents.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Application of Nanomaterials in Cell Autophagy.Autophagy is defined as separation and degradation of cytoplasmic components through autophagosomes  which plays an essential part in physiological and pathological events. Hence it is also essential for cellular homeostasis. Autophagy disorder may bring about the failure of stem cells to maintain the fundamental transformation and metabolism of cell components. However  for cancer cells  the disorder of autophagy is a feasible antitumor idea. Nanoparticles  referring to particles of the size range 1-100 nanometers  are appearing as a category of autophagy regulators. These nanoparticles may revolutionize and broaden the therapeutic strategies of many diseases  including neurodegenerative diseases  tumors  muscle disease  and so on. Researches of autophagy-induced nanomaterials mainly focus on silver particles  gold particles  silicon particles  and rare earth oxides. But in recent years  more and more materials have been found to regulate autophagy  such as nano-nucleic acid materials  nanofiber scaffolds  quantum dots  and so on. The review highlights that various kinds of nanoparticles have the power to regulate autophagy intensity in stem cells of interest and further control biological behaviors  which may become a reliable treatment choice for disease therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The cargo receptor SQSTM1 ameliorates neurofibrillary tangle pathology and spreading through selective targeting of pathological MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau).Accumulating evidence suggests that misfolded MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau)  the main component of neurofibrillary tangles in tauopathies  is subject to degradation by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Selective autophagy is a subtype of macroautophagy that requires cargo receptors  such as OPTN (optineurin) or SQSTM1  to recognize specific targets for their sequestration within the autophagosome and their eventual degradation by the lysosome  although their roles in targeting distinct MAPT species have not been fully investigated. Using cargo receptor knockout cell lines and a seeding-based cellular assay in which neurofibrillary tangle pathology can be modeled in vitro  we reveal that while OPTN primarily targets soluble MAPT expressed in physiological conditions  SQSTM1 predominantly degrades insoluble but not soluble mutant MAPT. Endogenous SQSTM1 colocalizes with misfolded and aggregated MAPT species in vitro and in vivo  and both this colocalization and its function in MAPT clearance require both the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif and also the PB1 self-polymerization domain of SQSTM1. Further  pathogenic MAPT accumulation reduces basal macroautophagy/autophagy in vitro and is associated with a compensatory upregulation of the lysosomal pathway in vivo. Finally  increased expression of SQSTM1 in MAPT transgenic mouse brains ameliorates MAPT pathology and prion-like spreading. Our results uncover distinct properties of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different MAPT species  implicate compromised autophagy as a potential underlying factor in mutant MAPT deposition  and demonstrate a potent and specific role of SQSTM1 in targeted clearance of pathogenic MAPT  through which it blocks neurofibrillary tangle accumulation and pathological spreading.

Biokinetic modeling of nanoparticle interactions with lung alveolar epithelial cells: uptake  intracellular processing  and egress.Studies on health effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in the lung have provided information on ENM toxicity and translocation across airway and alveolar epithelial barriers. Various inhaled ENMs (e.g.  gold and iridium nanoparticles) have been reported to partially cross the air-blood barrier in the lung  enter the vasculature  and distribute in several end organs  including the heart  liver  spleen  and kidney. Using an in vitro primary rat alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) monolayer model  we reported transport rates of relatively nontoxic polystyrene nanoparticles (PNPs)  which appear to be taken up via nonendocytic processes into AECs. PNPs internalized into cytoplasm then trigger autophagy  followed by delivery of PNPs from autophagosomes into lysosomes  from where PNPs are exocytosed. We used the data from these experiments to perform biokinetic modeling that incorporates the processes associated with internalization and intracellular distribution of PNPs  autophagy  lysosomal exocytosis of PNPs  and several putative mechanisms of action that extend our previous understanding of AEC processing of PNPs. Results suggest that entry of PNPs into AECs  subsequent activation of autophagy by cytosolic PNPs  accumulation of PNPs in lysosomes  and lysosomal exocytosis are interwoven by proposed regulatory mechanisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy in fate determination of mesenchymal stem cells and bone remodeling.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely exploited as promising candidates in clinical settings for bone repair and regeneration in view of their self-renewal capacity and multipotentiality. However  little is known about the mechanisms underlying their fate determination  which would illustrate their effectiveness in regenerative medicine. Recent evidence has shed light on a fundamental biological role of autophagy in the maintenance of the regenerative capability of MSCs and bone homeostasis. Autophagy has been implicated in provoking an immediately available cytoprotective mechanism in MSCs against stress  while dysfunction of autophagy impairs the function of MSCs  leading to imbalances of bone remodeling and a wide range of aging and degenerative bone diseases. This review aims to summarize the up-to-date knowledge about the effects of autophagy on MSC fate determination and its role as a stress adaptation response. Meanwhile  we highlight autophagy as a dynamic process and a double-edged sword to account for some discrepancies in the current research. We also discuss the contribution of autophagy to the regulation of bone cells and bone remodeling and emphasize its potential involvement in bone disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
CemOrange2 fusions facilitate multifluorophore subcellular imaging in C. elegans.Due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transparency  Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has become a preferred model system to study gene function by microscopy. The use of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to proteins or targeting sequences of interest  further expanded upon the utility of C. elegans by labeling subcellular structures  which enables following their disposition during development or in the presence of genetic mutations. Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission spectra different from that of GFP accelerated the use of multifluorophore imaging in real time. We have expanded the repertoire of fluorescent proteins for use in C. elegans by developing a codon-optimized version of Orange2 (CemOrange2). Proteins or targeting motifs fused to CemOrange2 were distinguishable from the more common fluorophores used in the nematode; such as GFP  YFP  and mKate2. We generated a panel of CemOrange2 fusion constructs  and confirmed they were targeted to their correct subcellular addresses by colocalization with independent markers. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this new panel of fluorescent protein markers  we showed that CemOrange2 fusion proteins could be used to: 1) monitor biological pathways  2) multiplex with other fluorescent proteins to determine colocalization and 3) gain phenotypic knowledge of a human ABCA3 orthologue  ABT-4  trafficking variant in the C. elegans model organism.,Autophagy_notLIR
Co-targeting BET bromodomain BRD4 and RAC1 suppresses growth  stemness and tumorigenesis by disrupting the c-MYC-G9a-FTH1axis and downregulating HDAC1 in molecular subtypes of breast cancer.BET bromodomain BRD4 and RAC1 oncogenes are considered important therapeutic targets for cancer and play key roles in tumorigenesis  survival and metastasis. However  combined inhibition of BRD4-RAC1 signaling pathways in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer including luminal-A  HER-2 positive and triple-negative breast (TNBC) largely remains unknown. Here  we demonstrated a new co-targeting strategy by combined inhibition of BRD4-RAC1 oncogenic signaling in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a context-dependent manner. We show that combined treatment of JQ1 (inhibitor of BRD4) and NSC23766 (inhibitor of RAC1) suppresses cell growth  clonogenic potential  cell migration and mammary stem cells expansion and induces autophagy and cellular senescence in molecular subtypes of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically  JQ1/NSC23766 combined treatment disrupts MYC/G9a axis and subsequently enhances FTH1 to exert antitumor effects. Furthermore  combined treatment targets HDAC1/Ac-H3K9 axis  thus suggesting a role of this combination in histone modification and chromatin modeling. C-MYC depletion and co-treatment with vitamin-C sensitizes different molecular subtypes of breast cancer cells to JQ1/NSC23766 combination and further reduces cell growth  cell migration and mammosphere formation. Importantly  co-targeting RAC1-BRD4 suppresses breast tumor growth <i>in vivo</i> using xenograft mouse model. Clinically  RAC1 and BRD4 expression positively correlates in breast cancer patient's samples and show high expression patterns across different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Both RAC1 and BRD4 proteins predict poor survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together  our results suggest that combined inhibition of BRD4-RAC1 pathways represents a novel and potential therapeutic approach in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and highlights the importance of co-targeting RAC1-BRD4 signaling in breast tumorigenesis via disruption of C-MYC/G9a/FTH1 axis and down regulation of HDAC1.,Autophagy_notLIR
The HIF‑1α/miR‑224‑3p/ATG5 axis affects cell mobility and chemosensitivity by regulating hypoxia‑induced protective autophagy in glioblastoma and astrocytoma.Human glioblastoma is a malignant and aggressive primary human brain solid tumor characterized by severe hypoxia. Hypoxia can induce autophagy  which may result in chemoresistance and malignant progression of cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to modulate hypoxia‑induced autophagy in various types of cancers. In the present study  we observed that hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF)‑1α expression was increased while miR‑224‑3p expression was decreased under hypoxia in a time‑dependent manner in glioma LN229 and astrocytoma U‑251MG cell lines  as deteced by western blot analysis and real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition  HIF‑1α knockout inhibited cell motility and chemosensitivity by negatively regulating the expression of miR‑224‑3p under a hypoxic condition by Transwell and MTT assay. Moreover  hypoxia increased the relative expression of ATG5 (autophagy‑related gene 5) and LC3 II/I with a decreased level of p62. These results were correlated with autophagy in a time‑dependent manner  suggesting that hypoxia induced autophagy in glioblastoma and astrocytoma cells. Through bioinformatic prediction and luciferase reporter assay  we confirmed that ATG5 is a target of miR‑224‑3p and ATG5 expression was negatively regulated by miR‑224‑3p. Knockdown of ATG5 inhibited cell mobility with increased chemosensitivity of glioblastoma cells under hypoxia. Moreover  overexpression of miR‑224‑3p also inhibited cell mobility with increased chemosensitivity of glioblastoma cells under hypoxia. However  activation of autophagy was able to counteract these effects of miR‑224‑3p. Furthermore  in vivo experiments indicated that the miR‑224‑3p mimic enhanced the chemosensitivity of LN229 cells to temozolomide by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay. In summary  our experiments elucidated that the HIF‑1α/miR‑224‑3p/ATG5 axis affects cell mobility and chemosensitivity by regulating hypoxia‑induced autophagy in glioblastoma and astrocytoma. Therefore  miR‑224‑3p could be a novel target against hypoxia‑induced autophagy in glioblastoma and astrocytoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effect of cell culture models on the evaluation of anticancer activity and mechanism analysis of the potential bioactive compound  iturin A  produced by Bacillus subtilis.Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is widely used to evaluate the potential of food compounds in anticancer activity in vitro. However  3D culture is rarely used. In this study  we compared the obtained anticancer activity and mechanisms of iturin A  a multiple functional compound produced by Bacillus subtilis  in 2D and 3D cultures of HepG2 cells. 3D culture resulted in a much higher 50% inhibitory concentration (55.26 μM) compared to 2D culture (11.91 μM). Reactive oxygen species accumulation  autophagy  apoptosis characterized by cytochrome c release  high apoptotic protein expression and caspase activation were detected in both 2D and 3D cultures. Induction of paraptosis was also detected in 2D culture and the cytoplasmic vacuoles occurred in large numbers. Compared with 2D culture  3D culture can simulate the microenvironment in vivo and provide more accurate data. Therefore  3D culture was recommended for the evaluation of anticancer activity of food compounds towards solid tumors.,Autophagy_notLIR
An integrative microenvironment approach for laryngeal carcinoma: the role of immune/methylation/autophagy signatures on disease clinical prognosis and single-cell genotypes.The effects of methylation/autophagy-related genes (MARGs) and immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment on the prognosis of laryngeal cancer were comprehensively explored in this study. Survival analysis screened out 126 MARGs and 10 immune cells potentially associated with the prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma. Cox and lasso regression analyses were then used to select 8 MARGs (CAPN10  DAPK2  MBTPS2  ST13  CFLAR  FADD  PEX14 and TSC2) and 2 immune cells (Eosinophil and Mast cell) to obtain the prognostic risk scoring system (pRS). The pRS was used to establish a risk prediction model for the prognosis of laryngeal cancer. The predictive ability of the prediction model was evaluated by GEO datasets and our clinical samples. Further analysis revealed that pRS is highly associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  copy number variation (CNV)  immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy and tumor microenvironment. Moreover  the screened pRS-related ceRNA network and circ_0002951/miR-548k/HAS2 pathway provide potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers of laryngocarcinoma. Based on the clustering results of pRS-related genes  single cells were then genotyped and revealed by integrated scRNA-seq in laryngeal cancer samples. Fibroblasts were found enriched in high risk cell clusters at the scRNA-seq level. Fibroblast-related ligand-receptor interactions were then exposed and a neural network-based deep learning model based on these pRS-related hub gene signatures was also established with a high accuracy in cell type prediction. In conclusion  the combination of single-cell and transcriptome laryngeal carcinoma landscape analyses can investigate the link between the tumor microenvironmental and prognostic characteristics.,Autophagy_notLIR

Hydroxysafflor yellow A induces autophagy in human liver cancer cells by regulating Beclin 1 and ERK expression.Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is a water-soluble component of the safflower (<i>Carthamus tinctorius)</i>  and research has revealed that HSYA exhibits antitumor effects. In the present study  the effects of HSYA on the autophagy of a Hep-G2 liver cancer cell line  as well as the underlying mechanisms  were investigated. Hep-G2 cells were treated with HSYA and the viability of cells was measured using an MTT assay. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were performed to determine the expression of light chain 3 II (LC3-II) and p62  as well as the autophagy regulators Beclin 1 and ERK1/2. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the formation of autophagosomes. The combined effects of HSYA and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) were also determined. The results revealed that the viability of Hep-G2 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of HSYA. Furthermore  LC3-II expression increased significantly and the level of p62 decreased significantly in the HYSA group compared with the control group. Additionally  an increase in Beclin 1 expression and a decrease in phosphorylated-ERK1/2 expression was observed in Hep-G2 cells treated with HYSA. Following treatment with CQ and HSYA  a significant increase in the viability of Hep-G2 cells was observed compared with the HSYA group. Collectively  the results indicated that HSYA induced autophagy by promoting the expression of Beclin 1 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK in liver cancer cells. Therefore  HSYA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for liver cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
XIAP's Profile in Human Cancer.XIAP  the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein  regulates cell death signaling pathways through binding and inhibiting caspases. Mounting experimental research associated with XIAP has shown it to be a master regulator of cell death not only in apoptosis  but also in autophagy and necroptosis. As a vital decider on cell survival  XIAP is involved in the regulation of cancer initiation  promotion and progression. XIAP up-regulation occurs in many human diseases  resulting in a series of undesired effects such as raising the cellular tolerance to genetic lesions  inflammation and cytotoxicity. Hence  anti-tumor drugs targeting XIAP have become an important focus for cancer therapy research. RNA-XIAP interaction is a focus  which has enriched the general profile of XIAP regulation in human cancer. In this review  the basic functions of XIAP  its regulatory role in cancer  anti-XIAP drugs and recent findings about RNA-XIAP interactions are discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oleocanthal-Rich Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Restores the Blood-Brain Barrier Function through NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibition Simultaneously with Autophagy Induction in TgSwDI Mice.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple hallmarks including extracellular amyloid (Aβ) plaques  neurofibrillary tangles  dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB)  neuroinflammation  and impaired autophagy. Thus  novel strategies that target multiple disease pathways would be essential to prevent  halt  or treat the disease. A growing body of evidence including our studies supports a protective effect of oleocanthal (OC) and extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) at early AD stages before the onset of pathology. In addition  we reported previously that OC and EVOO exhibited such effect by restoring the BBB function; however  the mechanism(s) by which OC and EVOO exert such an effect and whether this effect extends to a later stage of AD remain unknown. In this work  we sought first to test the effect of OC-rich EVOO consumption at an advanced stage of the disease in TgSwDI mice  an AD mouse model  starting at the age of 6 months for 3 months treatment  and then to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which OC-rich EVOO exerts the observed beneficial effect. Overall findings demonstrated that OC-rich EVOO restored the BBB function and reduced AD-associated pathology by reducing neuroinflammation through inhibition of NACHT  LRR  and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and inducing autophagy through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway. Thus  diet supplementation with OC-rich EVOO could provide beneficial effect to slow or halt the progression of AD.,Autophagy_notLIR

MITOL promotes cell survival by degrading Parkin during mitophagy.Parkin promotes cell survival by removing damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. However  although some studies have suggested that Parkin induces cell death  the regulatory mechanism underlying the dual role of Parkin remains unknown. Herein  we report that mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase (MITOL/MARCH5) regulates Parkin-mediated cell death through the FKBP38-dependent dynamic translocation from the mitochondria to the ER during mitophagy. Mechanistically  MITOL mediates ubiquitination of Parkin at lysine 220 residue  which promotes its proteasomal degradation  and thereby fine-tunes mitophagy by controlling the quantity of Parkin. Deletion of MITOL leads to accumulation of the phosphorylated active form of Parkin in the ER  resulting in FKBP38 degradation and enhanced cell death. Thus  we have shown that MITOL blocks Parkin-induced cell death  at least partially  by protecting FKBP38 from Parkin. Our findings unveil the regulation of the dual function of Parkin and provide a novel perspective on the pathogenesis of PD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Galanin promotes autophagy and alleviates apoptosis in the hypertrophied heart through FoxO1 pathway.Autophagy and apoptosis are powerful regulators of multiple facets of cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Here  we uncover that galanin  a pleiotropic peptide  regulates cardiac autophagy and deactivates apoptotic cell death through the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) pathway. In hypertrophied heart  galanin promotes autophagy and metabolic shift from fatty acid (FA) to glucose oxidation and preserves mitochondrial integrity. In cardiomyoblasts  galanin triggers autophagosome formation and alleviates hypertrophy  apoptotic cell death  and mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically  galanin dictates cell autophagic and anti-apoptotic phenotypes through FoxO1 pathway. Together  these findings uncover a previously unknown role for galanin in the regulation of cardiac autophagy and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms supporting cell survival in the hypertrophic reprogramming of the heart.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-Induced Drug Resistance in Liver Cancer.Autophagy is a self-destructive process that occurs in the cells during abnormal conditions like protein aggregation due to misfolding  nutrient deprivation  damage to vital cell organelles  pathogenic infections  and during cancer. Typically  autophagy plays a key role in the renovation of new cells by balancing the equilibrium between cell death and cell renewal. Dysregulation of autophagy has a profound effect on protein turnover  mitochondrial homeostasis  clearance of damaged organelles  and cellular metabolism  which lead to neurodegenerative  metabolic  and proliferative diseases. Despite its antitumorigenic role  autophagy can promote cell proliferation by enhancing chemotherapeutic resistance in liver cancer. In the present review  we provide a comprehensive overview and discussion on the role of autophagy in the drug-resistant mechanisms of liver cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Atg32-dependent mitophagy sustains spermidine and nitric oxide required for heat-stress tolerance in Saccharomycescerevisiae.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae  the selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria  termed mitophagy  is critically regulated by the adapter protein Atg32. Despite our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which Atg32 controls mitophagy  its physiological roles in yeast survival and fitness remains less clear. Here  we demonstrate a requirement for Atg32 in promoting spermidine production during respiratory growth and heat-induced mitochondrial stress. During respiratory growth  mitophagy-deficient yeast exhibit profound heat-stress induced defects in growth and viability due to impaired biosynthesis of spermidine and its biosynthetic precursor S-adenosyl methionine. Moreover  spermidine production is crucial for the induction of cytoprotective nitric oxide (NO) during heat stress. Hence  the re-addition of spermidine to Atg32 mutant yeast is sufficient to both enhance NO production and restore respiratory growth during heat stress. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized physiological role for yeast mitophagy in spermidine metabolism and illuminate new interconnections between mitophagy  polyamine biosynthesis and NO signaling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy induction promotes renal cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease.Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) involves renal cysts arising from proliferating tubular cells.

However  the effect of autophagy regulation on cystogenesis has not been elucidated in PKD mice.,Autophagy_notLIR
Enhancement of epithelial cell autophagy induced by sinensetin alleviates epithelial barrier dysfunction in colitis.Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is a key pathology of colitis. Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin  a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus  on intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2  4  6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells  respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability  significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy  and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis  and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion  sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy  and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin-2 degradation. The results highlighted novel potential benefits of sinensetin in colitis.,Autophagy_notLIR

DMEP induces mitochondrial damage regulated by inhibiting Nrf2 and SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathways in HepG2 cells.Dimethoxyethyl phthalate (DMEP) is an environmental endocrine disruptor. However  research into the underlying mechanisms of DMEP mitochondrial toxicity is still in its infancy. We therefore expect to understand whether DMEP induced mitochondrial damage in HepG2 cells and the associated signaling pathways. DMEP (0.125  0.25  0.5  1 and 2 mM) exposure for 48 h induced a notable increment in reactive oxygen species (ROS)  malondialdehyde (MDA)  alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  aspartate transaminase (AST) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in hepG2 cells  resulting in cellular oxidative stress. Low doses of DMEP upregulated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and downstream protein haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels and high doses down-regulated their levels. Nrf2 levels increased after ROS scavenging by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)  which indicated that the Nrf2 pathway may be affected by oxidative stress. We also found that DMEP decreased ATP content  mitochondrial copy number (mtDNA)  translocase of the outer membrane subunit 20 (TOM20) expression  mitochondria-encoded genes CO1  CO2  CO3  ATP6  ATP8 expression  inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis pathway  down-regulated sirtuin 1(SIRT1)  PPAR gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α)  Nuclear respiratory factor 1(Nrf1)  Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) content and activated PINK1/Parkin autophagy pathway. DMEP also activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway  causing cytochrome c cytoplasmic translocation and caspase 3 cleavage. What's more  DMEP activated the Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)  interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly upregulated  causing an inflammatory response. In summary  DMEP can cause inflammatory response and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells  inhibited the Nrf2 pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis  and induced autophagy and apoptosis. And oxidative stress at least partially affected the Nrf2 pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
The roles of autophagy and thyroid hormone in the pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disorder worldwide. It comprises simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  which can further progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of NAFLD involves genetic  environmental  and endocrine factors  and several molecular mechanisms have been identified. In this review  we discuss the recent findings on the role of autophagy  in particular lipophagy and mitophagy  in hepatic lipid oxidation. We discuss the pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggesting that impairment of autophagy exacerbates NAFLD progression and restoration of autophagy exerts beneficial effects on NAFLD. We discuss how thyroid hormone (TH) simultaneously regulates lipophagy  mitophagy  and mitochondrial biogenesis to increase β-oxidation of fatty acids and reduce steatosis in the liver. Lastly  we discuss the recent clinical progress in using TH or thyromimetics in treating NAFLD/NASH.,Autophagy_notLIR
De novo RNA-Seq analysis in sensitive rice cultivar and comparative transcript profiling in contrasting genotypes reveal genetic biomarkers for fluoride-stress response.The fluoride-sensitive indica rice cultivar  IR-64 was subjected to NaF-treatment for 25 days  following which RNA-Seq analysis identified significant up and down regulation of 1 303 and 93 transcripts respectively. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis classified transcripts into groups related to 'cellular part'  'membrane'  'catalytic activity'  'transporter activity'  'binding'  'metabolic processes' and 'cellular processes'. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed fluoride-mediated suppression of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling. Instead  the gibberellin-dependent pathway and signaling via ABA-independent transcription factors (TFs) was activated. Comparative profiling of selected DEGs in IR-64 and fluoride-tolerant variety  Khitish revealed significant cytoskeletal and nucleosomal remodelling  accompanied with escalated levels of autophagy in stressed IR-64 (unlike that in stressed Khitish). Genes associated with ion  solute and xenobiotic transport were strongly up regulated in stressed IR-64  indicating potential fluoride entry through these channels. On the contrary  genes associated with xenobiotic mobility were suppressed in the tolerant cultivar  which restricted bioaccumulation and translocation of fluoride. Pairwise expression profile analysis between stressed IR-64 and Khitish  supported by extensive statistical modelling predicted that fluoride susceptibility was associated with high expression of genes like amino acid transporter  ABC transporter2  CLCd  MFS monosaccharide transporter  SulfT2.1 and PotT2 while fluoride tolerance with high expression of Sweet11.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy Induction Contributes to the Neuroprotective Impact of Intermittent Fasting on the Acutely Injured Spinal Cord.Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the leading causes of neurological disability and death. So far  there is no satisfactory treatment for SCI  because of its complex and ill-defined pathophysiology. Recently  autophagy has been implicated as protective in acute SCI rat models. Here  we investigated the therapeutic value of a dietary intervention  namely  intermittent fasting (IF)  on neuronal survival after acute SCI in rats  and its underlying mechanism related to autophagy regulation. We found remarkable improvement in both behavioral performance and neuronal survival at the injured segment of the spinal cord of animals previously subjected to IF. Western blotting revealed a marked decrease in apoptosis-related markers such as cleaved caspase 3 levels and the bax/bcl-2 ratio in the IF group  which suggested an inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. In addition  the expression of the autophagy markers LC3-II and beclin 1 was also increased in the IF group compared with <i>ad libitum</i> fed animals. In parallel  IF decreased the levels of the substrate protein of autophagy  p62  indicative of an upregulation of the autophagic processes. Treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA)  a selective inhibitor of autophagy  reversed the downregulated apoptosis-related markers by IF. Finally  IF could activate the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and enhance lysosome function by upregulating transcription factor (TF)EB expression. Altogether  the present findings suggest that IF exerts a neuroprotective effect after acute SCI via the upregulation of autophagy  and further points to dietary interventions as a promising combinatorial treatment for SCI.,Autophagy_notLIR
Melatonin and Autophagy in Aging-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.With aging  the nervous system gradually undergoes degeneration. Increased oxidative stress  endoplasmic reticulum stress  mitochondrial dysfunction  and cell death are considered to be common pathophysiological mechanisms of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)  Parkinson's disease (PD)  Huntington's disease (HD)  organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN)  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Autophagy is a cellular basic metabolic process that degrades the aggregated or misfolded proteins and abnormal organelles in cells. The abnormal regulation of neuronal autophagy is accompanied by the accumulation and deposition of irregular proteins  leading to changes in neuron homeostasis and neurodegeneration. Autophagy exhibits both a protective mechanism and a damage pathway related to programmed cell death. Because of its "double-edged sword"  autophagy plays an important role in neurological damage and NDDs including AD  PD  HD  OPIDN  and ALS. Melatonin is a neuroendocrine hormone mainly synthesized in the pineal gland and exhibits a wide range of biological functions  such as sleep control  regulating circadian rhythm  immune enhancement  metabolism regulation  antioxidant  anti-aging  and anti-tumor effects. It can prevent cell death  reduce inflammation  block calcium channels  etc. In this review  we briefly discuss the neuroprotective role of melatonin against various NDDs via regulating autophagy  which could be a new field for future translational research and clinical studies to discover preventive or therapeutic agents for many NDDs.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagosome formation in relation to the endoplasmic reticulum.Autophagy is a process in which a myriad membrane structures called autophagosomes are formed de novo in a single cell  which deliver the engulfed substrates into lysosomes for degradation. The size of the autophagosomes is relatively uniform in non-selective autophagy and variable in selective autophagy. It has been recently established that autophagosome formation occurs near the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this review  we have discussed recent advances in the relationship between autophagosome formation and endoplasmic reticulum. Autophagosome formation occurs near the ER subdomain enriched with phospholipid synthesizing enzymes like phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS)/CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT) and choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1). Autophagy-related protein 2 (Atg2)  which is involved in autophagosome formation has a lipid transfer capacity and is proposed to directly transfer the lipid molecules from the ER to form autophagosomes. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) and transmembrane protein 41b (TMEM41b) are ER membrane proteins that are associated with the formation of the subdomain. Recently  we have reported that an uncharacterized ER membrane protein possessing the DNAJ domain  called ERdj8/DNAJC16  is associated with the regulation of the size of autophagosomes. The localization of ERdj8/DNAJC16 partially overlaps with the PIS-enriched ER subdomain  thereby implying its association with autophagosome size determination.,Autophagy_notLIR
2-Amino-3 8-dimethylimidazo[4 5-<i>f</i>]quinoxaline Alters Autophagosome Maturation  Cellular Lipidomic Profiles  and Expression of Core Pluripotent Factors.2-Amino-3 8-dimethylimidazo[4 5-<i>f</i>]quinoxaline (MeIQx)  one of the most abundant heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) found in the human diet  is primarily produced during high-temperature meat or fish cooking. While MeIQx has been investigated as a potential carcinogen  the cytotoxicity and related molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here  we demonstrate that autophagosome maturation is blocked by MeIQx. Mechanistically  MeIQx inhibits acidification of lysosomes rather than prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover  cellular lipid profiles are altered by MeIQx treatment. Notably  many phospholipids and sphingolipids are significantly upregulated after exposure to MeIQx. Furthermore  MeIQx decreases expression of pluripotency-associated proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Together  MeIQx blocks autophagosome maturation through inhibiting acidification of lysosomes  alters lipid metabolism  and decreases expression of pluripotent factors. Our studies provide more cytotoxic evidence and elucidate related mechanisms on the risk of HAA exposure and are expected to promote supervision of food safety and human health.,Autophagy_notLIR
The functions of autophagy at the tumour-immune interface.Autophagy is frequently induced in the hypoxic tumour microenvironment. Accumulating evidence reveals important functions of autophagy at the tumour-immune interface. Herein  we propose an update on the roles of autophagy in modulating tumour immunity. Autophagy promotes adaptive resistance of established tumours to the cytotoxic effects of natural killer cells (NKs)  macrophages and effector T cells. Increased autophagic flux in tumours dampen their immunogenicity and inhibits the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by suppressing the activation of STING type I interferon signalling (IFN-I) innate immune sensing pathway. Autophagy in suppressive tumour-infiltrating immune subsets maintains their survival through metabolic remodelling. On the other hand  autophagy is involved in the antigen processing and presentation process  which is essential for anti-tumour immune responses. Genetic deletion of autophagy induces spontaneous tumours in some models. Thus  the role of autophagy is context-dependent. In summary  our review has revealed the dichotomous roles of autophagy in modulating tumour immunity. Broad targeting of autophagy may not yield maximal benefits. The characterization of specific genes regulating tumour immunogenicity and innovation in targeted delivery of autophagy inhibitors into certain tumours are among the most urgent tasks to sensitize cold cancers to immunotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Baicalein Mediates Mitochondrial Autophagy via miR-30b and the NIX/BNIP3 Signaling Pathway in Parkinson's Disease.Parkinson's disease (PD) is regarded as a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Baicalein is involved in the treatment of PD. This study explored the mechanism of baicalein in PD. The PD rat model was established using 6-hydroxydopamine. The neurologic score  dopamine (DA) content  apoptotic cells  and neuronal damage were evaluated after rats were treated with baicalein. Autophagy in PD rats was inhibited using 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and autophagy-related proteins (LC3  P62) were detected. Next  agomiR-30b was transfected into PD rats. The targeting relation between miR-30b and NIX was predicted and verified. Then  sh-NIX was transfected into PD rats  and the effects of miR-30b and NIX on MMP  LC3  and P62 were assessed. When miR-30b was overexpressed using agomiR-30b  the NIX and BNIP3 levels were detected. Baicalein increased the neurological score and restored DA content  neurons  MMP  and mitochondrial autophagy protein levels. Baicalein inhibited miR-30b expression and miR-30b targeted NIX. miR-30b upregulation or NIX silencing reversed the effect of baicalein on MMP and mitochondrial autophagy. Baicalein upregulated NIX and BNIP3 expressions  while miR-30b overexpression inhibited NIX and BNIP3 expressions. In summary  baicalein mediated mitochondrial autophagy and restored neuronal activity by downregulating miR-30b and activating the NIX/BNIP3 pathway  thus protecting against PD.,Autophagy_notLIR
STYK1 promotes autophagy through enhancing the assembly of autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I.Macroautophagy/autophagy plays key roles in development  oncogenesis  and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PtdIns3K-C1) is essential for autophagosome formation. However  the regulation of this complex formation requires further investigation. Here  we discovered that STYK1 (serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1)  a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) family  is a new upstream regulator of autophagy. We discovered that STYK1 facilitated autophagosome formation in human cells and zebrafish  which was characterized by elevated LC3-II and lowered SQSTM1/p62 levels and increased puncta formation by several marker proteins  such as ATG14  WIPI1  and ZFYVE1. Moreover  we observed that STYK1 directly binds to the PtdIns3K-C1 complex as a homodimer. The binding with this complex was promoted by Tyr191 phosphorylation  by means of which the kinase activity of STYK1 was elevated. We also demonstrated that STYK1 elevated the serine phosphorylation of BECN1  thereby decreasing the interaction between BECN1 and BCL2. Furthermore  we found that STYK1 preferentially facilitated the assembly of the PtdIns3K-C1 complex and was required for PtdIns3K-C1 complex kinase activity. Taken together  our findings provide new insights into autophagy induction and reveal evidence of novel crosstalk between the components of RTK signaling and autophagy. <b>Abbreviations</b>: AICAR: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; AMPK: adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BCL2: BCL2 apoptosis regulator; BECN1: beclin 1; Bre A: brefeldin A; Co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; DAPI: 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EBSS: Earle's balanced salt solution; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis; MAP1LC3/LC3  microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAPK8/JNK1: mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; mRFP: monomeric red fluorescent protein; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTT: 3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PIK3C3: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PIK3R4: phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RACK1: receptor for activated C kinase 1; RUBCN: rubicon autophagy regulator; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STYK1/NOK: serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas; Ub: ubiquitin; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; UVRAG: UV radiation resistance associated; WIPI1: WD repeat domain  phosphoinositide interacting 1; ZFYVE1: zinc finger FYVE-type containing 1.,Autophagy_notLIR
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C contributes to progressive cellular senescence.Stable transfection manipulation with antibiotic selection and passaging induces progressive cellular senescence phenotypes. However  the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study demonstrated that stable transfection of the empty vector induced PANC-1 cells into cellular senescence. Metabolomics revealed several acylcarnitines and their upstream regulatory gene  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) involved in fatty acid β-oxidation in mitochondria  were strikingly decreased in senescent PANC-1 cells. Low CPT1C expression triggered mitochondrial dysfunction  inhibited telomere elongation  impaired cell survival under metabolic stress  and hindered the malignance and tumorigenesis of senescent cells. On the contrary  mitochondrial activity was restored by CPT1C gain-of-function in senescent vector PANC-1 cells. PPARα and TP53/CDKN1A  crucial signaling components in cellular senescence  were downregulated in senescent PANC-1 cells. This study identifies CPT1C as a key regulator of stable transfection-induced progressive PANC-1 cell senescence that inhibits mitochondrial function-associated metabolic reprogramming. These findings confirm the need to identify cell culture alterations after stable transfection  particularly when cells are used for metabolomics and mitochondria-associated studies  and suggest inhibition of CPT1C could be a promising target to intervene pancreatic tumorigenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Normal ageing of the brain: Histological and biological aspects.All the hallmarks of ageing are observed in the brain  and its cells  especially neurons  are characterized by their remarkably long lifetime. Like any organ or system  the brain is exposed to ageing processes which affect molecules  cells  blood vessels  gross morphology and  uniquely for this organ  cognition. The preponderant cerebral structures are characterized by the cellular processes of neurons and glial cells and while the quantity of cerebral interstitial fluid is limited  it is now recognized as playing a crucial role in maintaining cerebral homeostasis. Most of our current knowledge of the ageing brain derives from studies of neurodegenerative disorders. It is interesting to note that common features of these disorders  like Tau  phosphoTau and amyloid peptide accumulation  can begin relatively early in life as a result of physiological ageing and are present in subclinical cases while also being used as early-stage markers of neurodegenerative diseases in progression. In this article  we review tissue and cellular modifications in the ageing brain. Commonly described macroscopic  microscopic and vascular changes that in the ageing brain are contrasted with those seen in neurodegenerative contexts. We also review the molecular changes that occur with age in the brain  such as modifications in gene expression  insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling dysfunction  post-translational protein modifications  mitochondrial dysfunction  autophagy and calcium conductance changes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Stress kinases in the development of liver steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important component of metabolic syndrome and one of the most prevalent liver diseases worldwide. This disorder is closely linked to hepatic insulin resistance  lipotoxicity  and inflammation. Although the mechanisms that cause steatosis and chronic liver injury in NAFLD remain unclear  a key component of this process is the activation of stress-activated kinases (SAPKs)  including p38 and JNK in the liver and immune system. This review summarizes findings which indicate that the dysregulation of stress kinases plays a fundamental role in the development of steatosis and are important players in inducing liver fibrosis. To avoid the development of steatohepatitis and liver cancer  SAPK activity must be tightly regulated not only in the hepatocytes but also in other tissues  including cells of the immune system. Possible cellular mechanisms of SAPK actions are discussed.,Autophagy_notLIR
Geniposide protection against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> toxicity correlates with mTOR inhibition and enhancement of autophagy.Overactivation of the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibition of autophagy in the brain are involved in Alzheimer's disease. The present paper's goal was to explore the potential mechanisms of geniposide to protect against Alzheimer's disease. We treated the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> as an Alzheimer's disease <i>in vitro</i> model to explore the potential mechanisms of geniposide to protect against Alzheimer's disease. Further  SH-SY5Y cells damaged by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were treated with geniposide. Akt/mTOR-related proteins and autophagy-associated proteins were measured to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which geniposide protects against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced toxicity. Results showed that Akt and mTOR's geniposide inhibited phosphorylation induced by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>  enhanced expression of the LC3II/LC3I ratio  and Atg7 and Beclin1 expression and inhibited expression of p62 induced by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Our results lead us to hypothesize that inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy enhancement are fundamental molecular mechanisms for geniposide to protect against Aβ toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Triggers Autophagy by Influencing the mTOR Pathway in the Spinal Dorsal Horn in a Rat Neuropathic Pain Model.Histone acetylation levels can be upregulated by treating cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs)  which can induce autophagy. Autophagy flux in the spinal cord of rats following the left fifth lumber spinal nerve ligation (SNL) is involved in the progression of neuropathic pain. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)  one of the HDACIs can interfere with the epigenetic process of histone acetylation  which has been shown to ease neuropathic pain. Recent research suggest that SAHA can stimulate autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in some types of cancer cells. However  little is known about the role of SAHA and autophagy in neuropathic pain after nerve injury. In the present study  we aim to investigate autophagy flux and the role of the mTOR pathway on spinal cells autophagy activation in neuropathic pain induced by SNL in rats that received SAHA treatment. Autophagy-related proteins and mTOR or its active form were assessed by using western blot  immunohistochemistry  double immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found that SAHA decreased the paw mechanical withdrawal threshold (PMWT) of the lower compared with SNL. Autophagy flux was mainly disrupted in the astrocytes and neuronal cells of the spinal cord dorsal horn on postsurgical day 28 and was reversed by daily intrathecal injection of SAHA (n = 100 nmol/day or n = 200 nmol/day). SAHA also decreased mTOR and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) expression  especially p-mTOR expression in astrocytes and neuronal cells of the spinal dorsal horn. These results suggest that SAHA attenuates neuropathic pain and contributes to autophagy flux in astrocytes and neuronal cells of the spinal dorsal horn via the mTOR signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein regulates non-selective autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in human myeloid cells.The actin cytoskeletal regulator Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) has been implicated in maintenance of the autophagy-inflammasome axis in innate murine immune cells. Here  we show that WASp deficiency is associated with impaired rapamycin-induced autophagosome formation and trafficking to lysosomes in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). WASp reconstitution in vitro and in WAS patients following clinical gene therapy restores autophagic flux and is dependent on the actin-related protein complex ARP2/3. Induction of mitochondrial damage with CCCP  as a model of selective autophagy  also reveals a novel ARP2/3-dependent role for WASp in formation of sequestrating actin cages and maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity. Furthermore  mitochondrial respiration is suppressed in WAS patient MDMs and unable to achieve normal maximal activity when stressed  indicating profound intrinsic metabolic dysfunction. Taken together  we provide evidence of new and important roles of human WASp in autophagic processes and immunometabolic regulation  which may mechanistically contribute to the complex WAS immunophenotype.,Autophagy_notLIR
Desmin aggrephagy in rat and human ischemic heart failure through PKCζ and GSK3β as upstream signaling pathways.Post-translational modifications of cardiac proteins could participate to left contractile dysfunction resulting in heart failure. Using a rat model of ischemic heart failure  we showed an accumulation of phosphorylated desmin leading to toxic aggregates in cardiomyocytes  but the cellular mechanisms are unknown. The same rat model was used to decipher the kinases involved in desmin phosphorylation and the proteolytic systems present in rat and human failing hearts. We used primary cultures of neonate rat cardiomyocytes for testing specific inhibitors of kinases and for characterizing the autophagic processes able to clear desmin aggregates. We found a significant increase of active PKCζ  no modulation of ubitiquitin-proteasome system  a defect in macroautophagy  and an activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy in heart failure rats. We validated in vitro that PKCζ inhibition induced a significant decrease of GSK3β and of soluble desmin. In vitro activation of ubiquitination of proteins and of chaperone-mediated autophagy is able to decrease soluble and insoluble forms of desmin in cardiomyocytes. These data demonstrate a novel signaling pathway implicating activation of PKCζ in desmin phosphorylation associated with a defect of proteolytic systems in ischemic heart failure  leading to desmin aggrephagy. Our in vitro data demonstrated that ubiquitination of proteins and chaperone-mediated autophagy are required for eliminating desmin aggregates with the contribution of its chaperone protein  α-crystallin Β-chain. Modulation of the kinases involved under pathological conditions may help preserving desmin intermediate filaments structure and thus protect the structural integrity of contractile apparatus of cardiomyocytes by limiting desmin aggregates formation.,Autophagy_notLIR
TFEB drives PGC-1α expression in adipocytes to protect against diet-induced metabolic dysfunction.TFEB is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that confers protection against metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis by targeting a network of genes involved in autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis and lipid catabolism. In this study  we sought to characterize the role of TFEB in adipocyte and adipose tissue physiology and evaluate the therapeutic potential of adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression in obesity. We demonstrated that mice with adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression (Adipo-TFEB) were protected from diet-induced obesity  insulin resistance  and metabolic sequelae. Adipo-TFEB mice were lean primarily through increased metabolic rate  suggesting a role for adipose tissue browning and enhanced nonshivering thermogenesis in fat. Transcriptional characterization revealed that TFEB targeted genes involved in adipose tissue browning rather than those involved in autophagy. One such gene encoded PGC-1α  an established target of TFEB that promotes adipocyte browning. To dissect the role of PGC-1α in mediating the downstream effects of TFEB overexpression  we generated mice with adipocyte-specific PGC-1α deficiency and TFEB overexpression. Without PGC-1α  the ability of TFEB overexpression to brown adipose tissue and to elicit beneficial metabolic effects was blunted. Overall  these data implicate TFEB as a PGC-1α-dependent regulator of adipocyte browning and suggest its therapeutic potential in treating metabolic disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
The cholesterol 24-hydroxylase activates autophagy and decreases mutant huntingtin build-up in a neuroblastoma culture model of Huntington's disease.Compromised brain cholesterol turnover and altered regulation of brain cholesterol metabolism have been allied with some neurodegenerative diseases  including Huntington's disease (HD).

A Novel Anticancer Therapeutic Strategy to Target Autophagy Accelerates Radiation-Associated Atherosclerosis.Autophagy inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy suggested for patients with advanced cancer  especially those who have undergone radiation therapy.

Oncogenic pathway driven by p85β: upstream signals to activate p110.The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  which is composed of the p85 regulatory and p110 catalytic subunits  is known to be downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Our recent findings revealed that p85β increases the protein level of AXL (an RTK) to activate p110  suggesting bidirectional regulation between PI3K and RTK.,Autophagy_notLIR
Resveratrol ameliorates malathion-induced estrus cycle disorder through attenuating the ovarian tissue oxidative stress  autophagy and apoptosis.Malathion is a high-efficiency organic phosphorus broad-spectrum insecticide which is commonly used in agricultural production  sanitation and epidemic prevention. Although the toxic effects of malathion on animal reproduction have been partially evaluated  its function  regulatory mechanism and antidote in estrus cycle and reproductive damage remain generally unclear. Here  the results showed that malathion disrupted the normal estrus cycle in mice  reduced the secretion of ovarian hormones  increased the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS)  and promoted autophagy and apoptosis in the ovary. Interestingly  we found that an antioxidant resveratrol could inhibit the disorders of estrus cycle and steroid hormone synthesis  reduced the abnormality of ROS accumulation  autophagy and apoptosis in malathion-exposed ovarian tissue. Furthermore  compared with those of the control group  malathion induced autophagy and apoptosis in the granular cells  whereas resveratrol attenuated these effects of malathion. Therefore  disadvantages of malathion exposure on estrus cycle disorder could partly reverse by resveratrol supplement. Overall  resveratrol may be a potential drug to prevent malathion-induced ovarian damages and estrus cycle disorder. Our findings provide new insights into ovarian response to malathion and resveratrol exposure.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dihydroartemisinin inhibits activation of the AIM2 inflammasome pathway and NF-κB/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway by inducing autophagy in A431 human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells.The therapeutic effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has been previously demonstrated; however  the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study sought to verify the therapeutic effect of DHA against cSCC and explore its underlying mechanism in A431 cSCC cells. This study reported that DHA inhibited A431 cells proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and promoted A431 cells apoptosis. Moreover  DHA inhibited the invasion and migration of A431 cells. Mechanistically  DHA promoted autophagy and inhibited activation of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome pathway and NF-κB/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway. Treatment of A431 cells with the mTOR inhibitor  and autophagy promoter  rapamycin also inhibited these two pathways. In conclusion  DHA inhibited activation of the AIM2 inflammasome pathway and NF-κB/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway by promoting autophagy in A431 cells  thus accounting for its therapeutic effect. Induction of autophagy by DHA may be mediated by inhibiting the mTOR pathway and promoting reactive oxygen species production.,Autophagy_notLIR
MIUH Inhibits the Hippocampal Neuron Growth in Fetal Rat by Affecting the PTEN Pathway.Mild intrauterine hypoperfusion (MIUH) can induce placental dysfunction and lead to long-term changes during the process of brain development. A better understanding of the mechanism of MIUH will help in the development of new neuroprotective strategies for the placental chamber. To better understand the mechanism of the effect of MIUH on the neural development of offspring  we constructed a model of MIUH in pregnant rats. The proliferation  apoptosis  and autophagy of hippocampal neurons in fetal rats were studied via flow cytometry  immunofluorescence staining  JC-1 staining  western blotting  and real-time polymerase chain reaction at different time points (6  24  48  and 72 h). The results showed that MIUH significantly inhibited the proliferation of hippocampal neurons and promoted their apoptosis and autophagy. Simultaneously  MIUH could promote PTEN expression and affect the PTEN signaling pathway. bpV  an inhibitor of PTEN  could restore the inhibition of hippocampal nerve cell growth caused by MIUH. MIUH may inhibit neuronal proliferation and promote neuronal apoptosis and autophagy by regulating the PTEN signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Emerging club drugs: 5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran (5-APB) is more toxic than its isomer 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran (6-APB) in hepatocyte cellular models.New phenylethylamine derivatives are among the most commonly abused new psychoactive substances. They are synthesized and marketed in lieu of classical amphetaminic stimulants  with no previous safety testing. Our study aimed to determine the in vitro hepatotoxicity of two benzofurans [6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran (6-APB) and 5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran (5-APB)] that have been misused as 'legal highs'. Cellular viability was assessed through the 3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay  following 24-h drug exposure of human hepatoma HepaRG cells (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.62 mM 5-APB; 6.02 mM 6-APB)  HepG2 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> 3.79 mM 5-APB; 8.18 mM 6-APB) and primary rat hepatocytes (EC<sub>50</sub> 964 μM 5-APB; 1.94 mM 6-APB). Co-incubation of primary hepatocytes  the most sensitive in vitro model  with CYP450 inhibitors revealed a role of metabolism  in particular by CYP3A4  in the toxic effects of both benzofurans. Also  6-APB and 5-APB concentration-dependently enhanced oxidative stress (significantly increased reactive species and oxidized glutathione  and decreased reduced glutathione levels) and unsettled mitochondrial homeostasis  with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and decline of intracellular ATP. Evaluation of cell death mechanisms showed increased caspase-8  -9  and -3 activation  and nuclear morphological changes consistent with apoptosis; at concentrations higher than 2 mM  however  necrosis prevailed. Concentration-dependent formation of acidic vesicular organelles typical of autophagy was also observed for both drugs. Overall  5-APB displayed higher hepatotoxicity than its 6-isomer. Our findings provide new insights into the potential hepatotoxicity of these so-called 'safe drugs' and highlight the putative risks associated with their use as psychostimulants.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cell Cycle-Dependence of Autophagic Activity and Inhibition of Autophagosome Formation at M Phase in Tobacco BY-2 Cells.Autophagy is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and plays an essential role in stress adaptation and development by recycling nutrients and maintaining cellular homeostasis. However  the dynamics and regulatory mechanisms of autophagosome formation during the cell cycle in plant cells remain poorly elucidated. We here analyzed the number of autophagosomes during cell cycle progression in synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells expressing YFP-NtATG8a as a marker for the autophagosomes. Autophagosomes were abundant in the G2 and G1 phases of interphase  though they were much less abundant in the M and S phases. Autophagosomes drastically decreased during the G2/M transition  and the CDK inhibitor roscovitine inhibited the G2/M transition and the decrease in autophagosomes. Autophagosomes were rapidly increased by a proteasome inhibitor  MG-132. MG-132-induced autophagosome formation was also markedly lower in the M phases than during interphase. These results indicate that the activity of autophagosome formation is differently regulated at each cell cycle stage  which is strongly suppressed during mitosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy promotes oncolysis of an adenovirus expressing apoptin in human bladder cancer models.As a potential cancer therapy  we developed a recombinant adenovirus named Ad-VT  which was designed to express the apoptosis-inducing gene (apoptin) and selectively replicate in cancer cells via E1a manipulation. However  how it performs in bladder cancer remains unclear. We examined the antitumor efficacy of Ad-VT in bladder cancers using CCK-8 assays and xenograft models. Autophagy levels were evaluated by western blotting  MDC staining  and RFP-GFP-LC3 aggregates' analyses. Here  we report the selective replication and antitumor efficacy (viability inhibition and apoptosis induction) of Ad-VT in bladder cancer cells. Using xenograft tumor models  we demonstrate that its effects are tumor specific resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth and improvement of the survival of mice models. Most Importantly  Ad-VT induced a complete autophagy flux leading to autophagic cancer cell death through a signaling pathway involving AMPK  raptor and mTOR. Finally  we suggest that treatment combination of Ad-VT and rapamycin results in a synergistic improvement of tumor control and survival compared to monotherapy. This study suggests that Ad-VT can induce selective autophagic antitumor activities in bladder cancer through the AMPK-Raptor-mTOR pathway  which can be further improved by rapamycin.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Relationship Between Autophagy and Brain Plasticity in Neurological Diseases.Autophagy  a catabolic degradation system  is utilized for destroying and recycling the damaged or unnecessary cellular components. Brain plasticity refers to the remarkable characteristics of brain neurons that change their structure and function according to previous experience. This review was performed by searching the relevant articles in databases of SCIENCEDIRECT  PUBMED  and Web of Science  from respective inception to January 2019. Here  we review the neuroprotective effect of autophagy in neurological diseases and the mechanism of autophagy in brain plasticity. Moreover  the mechanism of autophagy in the process of brain plasticity can provide the possibility for the development of new treatment methods in the future  thus benefiting patients with neurological diseases. In summary  autophagy and brain plasticity play important roles in neurological diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy in the Light of Evolution: Insight from Fish.Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a major pathway of lysosomal proteolysis recognized as a key player of the control of numerous cellular functions  and whose defects have been associated with several human pathologies. To date  this cellular function is presumed to be restricted to mammals and birds  due to the absence of an identifiable lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A)  a limiting and essential protein for CMA  in nontetrapod species. However  the recent identification of expressed sequences displaying high homology with mammalian LAMP2A in several fish species challenges that view and suggests that CMA likely appeared earlier during evolution than initially thought. In the present study  we provide a comprehensive picture of the evolutionary history of the LAMP2 gene in vertebrates and demonstrate that LAMP2 indeed appeared at the root of the vertebrate lineage. Using a fibroblast cell line from medaka fish (Oryzias latipes)  we further show that the splice variant lamp2a controls  upon long-term starvation  the lysosomal accumulation of a fluorescent reporter commonly used to track CMA in mammalian cells. Finally  to address the physiological role of Lamp2a in fish  we generated knockout medaka for that specific splice variant  and found that these deficient fish exhibit severe alterations in carbohydrate and fat metabolisms  in consistency with existing data in mice deficient for CMA in liver. Altogether  our data provide the first evidence for a CMA-like pathway in fish and bring new perspectives on the use of complementary genetic models  such as zebrafish or medaka  for studying CMA in an evolutionary perspective.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sirtuin 3 governs autophagy-dependent glycolysis during Angiotensin II-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.The impairment of autophagy can cause cellular metabolic perturbations involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). However  the interplay between the cellular autophagy machinery and endothelial metabolism remains elusive. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)  an NAD-dependent deacetylase  is a major cellular sensor of energy metabolism. The aim of this work was to determine the role of SIRT3-mediated autophagy in cellular metabolism and the process of EndoMT. We demonstrated that Angiotensin II (Ang II) led to defective autophagic flux and high levels of glycolysis in endothelial cells (ECs) accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial SIRT3 during EndoMT. The loss of SIRT3 further induced the hyperacetylation of endogenous autophagy-regulated gene 5 (ATG5)  which in turn inhibited autophagosome maturation and increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) dimer expression. The M2 dimer is the less active form of PKM2  which drives glucose through aerobic glycolysis. Additionally  TEPP-46  a selective PKM2 tetramer activator  produced lower concentrations of lactate and led to the reduction of EndoMT both in vitro and in vivo. In parallel  the blockade of lactate influx from ECs into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) downregulated synthetic VSMC markers. EC-specific SIRT3 transgenic mice exhibited reduced endothelial cell transition but partial rescue of vascular fibrosis and collagen accumulation. Taken together  these findings reveal that SIRT3 regulates EndoMT by improving the autophagic degradation of PKM2. Pharmacological targeting of glycolysis metabolism may  therefore  represent an effective therapeutic strategy for hypertensive vascular remodeling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Augmentation of Glucotoxicity  Oxidative Stress  Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in HepG2 Cells by Palmitic Acid.Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are the hallmarks of diabetes and obesity. Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary management and caloric restriction are beneficial in reducing the complications of diabesity. Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty acids induces metabolic  oxidative  and mitochondrial stress  accompanied by inflammation that may lead to chronic complications in diabetes. In the present study  we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high palmitic acid (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-  inflammatory-  and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased lipid  protein  and DNA damage  leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug metabolism and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with palmitic acid  which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed. Our results suggest that the presence of high-energy metabolites enhances apoptosis while suppressing autophagy by inducing inflammatory and oxidative stress responses that may be responsible for alterations in cell signaling and metabolism.,Autophagy_notLIR
<i>Breaking Bad</i>: Autophagy Tweaks the Interplay Between Glioma and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment.Though significant strides in tumorigenic comprehension and therapy modality have been witnessed over the past decades  glioma remains one of the most common and malignant brain tumors characterized by recurrence  dismal prognosis  and therapy resistance. Immunotherapy advance holds promise in glioma recently. However  the efficacy of immunotherapy varies among individuals with glioma  which drives researchers to consider the modest levels of immunity in the central nervous system  as well as the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Considering the highly conserved property for sustaining energy homeostasis in mammalian cells and repeatedly reported links in malignancy and drug resistance  autophagy is determined as a cutting angle to elucidate the relations between glioma and the TIME. In this review  heterogeneity of TIME in glioma is outlined along with the reciprocal impacts between them. In addition  controversies on whether autophagy behaves cytoprotectively or cytotoxically in cancers are covered. How autophagy collapses from its homeostasis and aids glioma malignancy  which may depend on the cell type and the cellular context such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level  are briefly discussed. The consecutive application of autophagy inducers and inhibitors may improve the drug resistance in glioma after overtreatments. It also highlights that autophagy plays a pivotal part in modulating glioma and the TIME  respectively  and the intricate interactions among them. Specifically  autophagy is manipulated by either glioma or tumor-associated macrophages to conform one side to the other through exosomal microRNAs and thereby adjust the interactions. Given that some of the crosstalk between glioma and the TIME highly depend on the autophagy process or autophagic components  there are interconnections influenced by the status and well-being of cells presumably associated with autophagic flux. By updating the most recent knowledge concerning glioma and the TIME from an autophagic perspective enhances comprehension and inspires more applicable and effective strategies targeting TIME while harnessing autophagy collaboratively against cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Construction and Validation of an Autophagy-Related Prognostic Model for Osteosarcoma Patients.While the prognostic value of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in OS patients remains scarcely known  increasing evidence is indicating that autophagy is closely associated with the development and progression of osteosarcoma (OS). Therefore  we explored the prognostic value of ARGs in OS patients and illuminate associated mechanisms in this study. When the OS patients in the training/validation cohort were stratified into high- and low-risk groups according to the risk model established using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis  we observed that patients in the low-risk group possessed better prognosis (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Univariate/Multivariate COX regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that the ARGs-based risk model was an independent survival indicator for OS patients. The nomogram incorporating the risk model and clinical features exhibited excellent prognostic accuracy. GO  KEGG  and GSVA analyses collectively indicated that bone development-associated pathway mediated the contribution of ARGs to the malignance of OS. Immune infiltration analysis suggested the potential pivotal role of macrophage in OS. In summary  the risk model based on 12 ARGs possessed potent capacity in predicting the prognosis of OS patients. Our work may assist clinicians to map out more reasonable treatment strategies and facilitate individual-targeted therapy in osteosarcoma.,Autophagy_notLIR
Effects of a combined therapy of bortezomib and ionizing radiation on chondrosarcoma three-dimensional spheroid cultures.Chondrosarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of primary bone cancers that are characterized by hyaline cartilaginous neoplastic tissue and are predominantly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. However  adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended in inoperable cases or after incomplete resections. To improve the efficiency of treatment  the present study tested a combination therapy with ionizing radiation (IR) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Using a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid model  0-20 Gy of IR was applied to chondrosarcoma cells and healthy human chondrocytes. Following combined treatment with IR and bortezomib  the cell cycle distribution  apoptotic induction  the survivin pathway  autophagy and DNA damage were evaluated. Both cell types exhibited a slight decrease in viability following increasing doses of IR; the chondrosarcoma cells demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in the expression levels of the DNA damage marker histone H2AX phosphorylation at serine 139 (γH2AX). The combination treatment with bortezomib significantly decreased the cell viability after 48 h compared with that in irradiated cells. High-dose IR induced a G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest  which was accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells at the G<sub>1</sub> and S phase. Co-treatment with bortezomib changed the distribution of the cell cycle phases. The mRNA expression levels of the proapoptotic genes Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bak were significantly increased by bortezomib treatment and combination therapy with IR. In addition  the combination therapy resulted in a synergistic decrease of the expression levels of survivin and its corresponding downstream pathway molecules  including heat shock protein 90  X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein  smad 2 and smad 3. Comparative analyses of γH2AX at 1 and 24 h post-IR revealed efficient DNA repair in human chondrosarcoma cells. Therefore  additional bortezomib treatment may only temporarily improve the radiation sensitivity of chondrosarcoma cells. However  the inhibition of the survivin pathway by the combined treatment with IR and bortezomib  observed in the present study  revealed a novel aspect in the tumor biology of chondrosarcoma 3D spheroid cultures and may represent a potential target for therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Journey of the Synaptic Autophagosome: A Cell Biological Perspective.Autophagy is a key cellular degradative pathway  important for neuronal homeostasis and function. Disruption of autophagy is associated with neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Autophagy is compartmentalized in neurons  with specific stages of the pathway occurring in distinct subcellular compartments. Coordination of these stages drives progression of autophagy and enables clearance of substrates. Yet  we are only now learning how these distributed processes are integrated across the neuron. In this review  we focus on the cell biological course of autophagy in neurons  from biogenesis at the synapse to degradation in the soma. We describe how the steps of autophagy are distributed across neuronal subcellular compartments  how local machinery regulates autophagy  and the impact of coordinated regulation on neuronal physiology and disease. We also discuss how recent advances in our understanding of neuronal autophagic mechanisms have reframed how we think about the role of local regulation of autophagy in all tissues.,Autophagy_notLIR
Imbalance of Autophagy and Apoptosis Induced by Oxidative Stress May Be Involved in Thyroid Damage Caused by Sleep Deprivation in Rats.Many studies have shown that sleep deprivation can affect a wide range of tissues and organs  and most of these effects are related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can cause functional and morphological changes in cells  which are closely related to autophagy and apoptosis. In this study  we examined changes in thyroid morphology and function  oxidative stress  autophagy  and apoptosis in rats after sleep deprivation. Thyroid hormones  thyroid-stimulating hormone  functional substances required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones  and thyroid morphological observations were used to evaluate the changes and impairment of thyroid function. Methane dicarboxylic aldehyde and total antioxidant capacity were measured to assess oxidative stress in the thyroid. To evaluate the balance of autophagy and apoptosis  the expression of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins was examined by western blotting  and apoptotic cells were labeled with TUNEL staining. The body weight of rats in the sleep deprivation group decreased  but the relative weight of the thyroid gland increased. Sleep deprivation led to morphological changes in the thyroid. The levels of thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone increased after sleep deprivation. Total antioxidant capacity decreased  and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde levels increased in the thyroid in the sleep deprivation group. Analysis of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins indicated that the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta- (LC3B-) and LC3A-II/I ratio and Beclin 1 levels significantly decreased in the sleep deprivation group and P62 levels significantly increased. The number of apoptotic cells in the thyroid gland of sleep-deprived rats increased significantly. Taken together  these results indicate that sleep deprivation can lead to oxidative stress in the thyroid and ultimately cause thyroid damage  which may be related to the imbalance of autophagy and apoptosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Transcriptome Analysis and Autophagy Investigation of LoVo Cells Stimulated with Exosomes Derived from <i>T. asiatica</i> Adult Worms.<i>Taenia asiatica</i> is a zoonotic parasite found in the human intestine and pig liver that evolved various strategies to survive the host's defenses. Exosomes are membranous vesicles released by cells and are an important vehicle in parasite-host interactions. However  no literature exists on the specific infection mechanisms of <i>T. asiatica</i> against the host defense response  and further research is required to understand the parasite-host interaction. In this study  we investigated the host's differentially expressed genes (DEGs) while stimulating them with exosomes derived from the <i>T. asiatica</i> adult worm (Tas-exo) on LoVo by RNA-seq analysis. Our results identified 348 genes as being significantly differentially expressed for the Tas-exo group when comparing with that of the NC group. Some of these genes are related to modulation of cell proliferation and cell autophagy. Surprisingly  autophagy and cell proliferation have crucial roles in the defense against parasites; accordingly  we detected cell proliferation and autophagy in LoVo cells by CCK8  immunofluorescence  and Western blotting  demonstrating that Tas-exo could inhibit LoVo cell proliferation and autophagy via AMPK pathway. When P62 and p-mTOR/mTOR expression were significantly increased  BeclinI and pAMPK/AMPK were significantly decreased. These results expand our understanding of parasite-host interactions mediated by exosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Skeletal muscles of hibernating black bears show minimal atrophy and phenotype shifting despite prolonged physical inactivity and starvation.Hibernating mammals experience prolonged periods of torpor and starvation during winter for up to 5-7 months. Though physical inactivity and malnutrition generally lead to profound loss of muscle mass and metabolic dysfunction in humans  hibernating bears show limited muscle atrophy and can successfully maintain locomotive function. These physiological features in bears allow us to hypothesize that hibernating bears uniquely alter the regulation of protein and energy metabolism in skeletal muscle which then contributes to "muscle atrophy resistance" against continued physical inactivity. In this study  alteration of signaling pathways governing protein and energy metabolisms was examined in skeletal muscle of the Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus). Sartorius muscle samples were collected from bear legs during late November (pre-hibernation) and early April (post-hibernation). Protein degradation pathways  through a ubiquitin-proteasome system (as assessed by increased expression of murf1 mRNA) and an autophagy-dependent system (as assessed by increased expression of atg7  beclin1  and map1lc3 mRNAs)  were significantly activated in skeletal muscle following hibernation. In contrast  as indicated by a significant increase in S6K1 phosphorylation  an activation state of mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin)  which functions as a central regulator of protein synthesis  increased in post-hibernation samples. Gene expression of myostatin  a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass  was significantly decreased post-hibernation. We also confirmed that the phenotype shifted toward slow-oxidative muscle and mitochondrial biogenesis. These observations suggest that protein and energy metabolism may be altered in skeletal muscle of hibernating bears  which then may contribute to limited loss of muscle mass and efficient energy utilization.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inverse sex-based expression profiles of PTEN and Klotho in mice.Sex differences are considered predictive factors in the development of several neurological diseases  which are also known to coincide with impaired phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway activity  an essential signaling cascade involved in the control of several cellular functions such as autophagy and apoptosis. Here  under physiological conditions  we show important sex differences in the underlying balancing mechanisms that lead to similar AKT activity levels and autophagy and apoptosis processes in the two sexes. We demonstrate inverse sex-based expression of PTEN and Klotho  two important proteins that are known to negatively regulate the AKT pathway  and inverse sex-dependent levels of mTOR and FoxO3a activity. Taken together  our findings indicate that inverse sex-based regulation may be one of the underlying balancing mechanisms that differ between the sexes and a possible cause of sex-based autophagic and apoptotic responses to triggering situations that can lead to a sex-based predisposition to some neurological diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
PARP14 inhibits microglial activation via LPAR5 to promote post-stroke functional recovery.Stroke is a major public health problem leading to high rates of death and disability worldwide  but no effective pharmacological therapy is currently available except for the use of PLAT (plasminogen activator  tissue). Here we show that PARP14 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family  member 14) level was significantly increased in the peri-infarct zone of photothrombotic stroke (PT) mice. Genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of PARP14 aggravated functional impairment and increased infarct volume in PT mice  while overexpression of PARP14 displayed the opposite effects. Furthermore  PARP14 was abundant in microglia  and downregulation of PARP14 increased post-stroke microglial activation  whereas overexpression of PARP14 alleviated microglial activation  possibly through microglial macroautophagy/autophagy modulation. Mechanistically  overexpression of PARP14 suppressed <i>Lpar5</i> (lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5) gene transcription to inhibit microglial activation post stroke. Taken together  PARP14 is a stroke-induced signal that restricts microglial activation and promotes functional recovery  and can serve as a novel target to develop new therapeutic agents for stroke. Moreover  these findings may be conducive to proper use of various PARP inhibitors.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; AIF1/Iba-1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; CNS: central nervous system; CQ: chloroquine; DAPI: 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; IL6/IL-6: interleukin 6; LPAR5: lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; NOS2/iNOS: nitric oxide synthase 2  inducible; OGD: oxygen glucose deprivation; PAR: polymer of poly (ADP ribose); PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PLAT/tPA: plasminogen activator  tissue; PT: photothrombotic stroke; qPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Rap: rapamycin; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein  fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 3; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor.,Autophagy_notLIR

Druggable Biochemical Pathways and Potential Therapeutic Alternatives to Target Leukemic Stem Cells and Eliminate the Residual Disease in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a disease arising in stem cells expressing the BCR-ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase that transforms one Hematopoietic stem/progenitor Cell into a Leukemic Stem Cell (LSC) at the origin of differentiated and proliferating leukemic cells in the bone marrow (BM). CML-LSCs are recognized as being responsible for resistances and relapses that occur despite the advent of BCR-ABL-targeting therapies with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). LSCs share a lot of functional properties with Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) although some phenotypical and functional differences have been described during the last two decades. Subverted mechanisms affecting epigenetic processes  apoptosis  autophagy and more recently metabolism and immunology in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) have been reported. The aim of this review is to bring together the modifications and molecular mechanisms that are known to account for TKI resistance in primary CML-LSCs and to focus on the potential solutions that can circumvent these resistances  in particular those that have been  or will be tested in clinical trials.,Autophagy_notLIR
Characterization of a natural variant of human NDP52 and its functional consequences on mitophagy.The role of mitophagy  a process that allows the removal of damaged mitochondria from cells  remains unknown in multiple sclerosis (MS)  a disease that is found associated with dysfunctional mitochondria. Here we have qualitatively and quantitatively studied the main players in PINK1-mediated mitophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We found the variant c.491G>A (rs550510  p.G140E) of NDP52  one of the major mitophagy receptor genes  associated with a MS cohort. Through the characterization of this variant  we discovered that the residue 140 of human NDP52 is a crucial modulator of NDP52/LC3C binding  promoting the formation of autophagosomes in order to drive efficient mitophagy. In addition  we found that in the PBMC population  NDP52 is mainly expressed in B cells and by ensuring efficient mitophagy  it is able to limit the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α following cell stimulation. In sum  our results contribute to a better understanding of the role of NDP52 in mitophagy and underline  for the first time  a possible role of NDP52 in MS.,Autophagy_notLIR
The role of NLRP3 in lead-induced neuroinflammation and possible underlying mechanism.Neuroinflammation induced by lead exposure (Pb) is a major cause of neurotoxicity of Pb in the central nervous system (CNS).

Crocetin promotes clearance of amyloid-β by inducing autophagy via the STK11/LKB1-mediated AMPK pathway.Alzheimer disease (AD) is usually accompanied by two prominent pathological features  cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and presence of MAPT/tau neurofibrillary tangles. Dysregulated clearance of Aβ largely contributes to its accumulation and plaque formation in the brain. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a lysosomal degradative process  which plays an important role in the clearance of Aβ. Failure of autophagic clearance of Aβ is currently acknowledged as a contributing factor to increased accumulation of Aβ in AD brains. In this study  we have identified crocetin  a pharmacologically active constituent from the flower stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i>  as a potential inducer of autophagy in AD. In the cellular model  crocetin induced autophagy in N9 microglial and primary neuron cells through STK11/LKB1 (serine/threonine kinase 11)-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. Autophagy induction by crocetin significantly increased Aβ clearance in N9 cells. Moreover  crocetin crossed the blood-brain barrier and induced autophagy in the brains' hippocampi of wild-type male C57BL/6 mice. Further studies in transgenic male 5XFAD mice  as a model of AD  revealed that one-month treatment with crocetin significantly reduced Aβ levels and neuroinflammation in the mice brains and improved memory function by inducing autophagy that was mediated by AMPK pathway activation. Our findings support further development of crocetin as a pharmacological inducer of autophagy to prevent  slow down progression  and/or treat AD.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Aβ: amyloid-β; ABCB1/P-gp/P-glycoprotein: ATP-binding cassette  subfamily B (MDR/TAP)  member 1; AD: Alzheimer disease; AMPK/PRKAA: AMP-activated protein kinase; APP: amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein; ATG: autophagy related; BBB: blood-brain barrier; BECN1: beclin 1  autophagy related; CAMKK2/CaMKKβ: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2  beta; CSE: Crocus sativus extract; CTSB: cathepsin B; EIF4EBP1: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; GSK3B/GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; Kp: brain partition coefficient; LRP1: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MAP2: microtubule-associated protein 2; MAPK/ERK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPT/tau: microtubule-associated protein tau; MTT: 3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MWM: Morris water maze; NFKB/NF-κB: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells; NMDA: N-methyl-d-aspartic acid; RPTOR: regulatory associated protein of MTOR; RPS6KB1/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; SRB: sulforhodamine B; STK11/LKB1: serine/threonine kinase 11; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TSC2: TSC complex subunit 2; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of Ceramide Accumulation in Podocytes by Myriocin Prevents Diabetic Nephropathy.Ceramides are associated with metabolic complications including diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes. Recent studies have reported that podocytes play a pivotal role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Also  mitochondrial dysfunction is known to be an early event in podocyte injury. Thus  we tested the hypothesis that ceramide accumulation in podocytes induces mitochondrial damage through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in patients with diabetic nephropathy.,Autophagy_notLIR

lncRNA NEAT1 ameliorates LPS‑induced inflammation in MG63 cells by activating autophagy and suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome.The mechanisms of inflammation in bone and joint tissue are complex and involve long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs)  which play an important role in this process. The aim of the present study was to screen out differentially expressed genes in human osteoblasts stimulated by inflammation  and to further explore the mechanisms underlying inflammatory responses and the functional activity of human osteoblasts through bioinformatics methods and in vitro experiments. For this purpose  MG63 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for different periods of time to construct an optimal inflammatory model and RNA sequencing was then performed on these cells. The levels of nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1)  various inflammatory factors  Nod‑like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) protein and osteogenesis‑related proteins  as well as the levels of cell apoptosis‑ and cell cycle‑related markers were measured in MG63 cells stimulated with LPS  transfected with NEAT1 overexpression plasmid and treated with bexarotene by western blot analysis  RT‑qPCR  immunofluorescence  FISH  TEM and flow cytometry. There were 427 differentially expressed genes in the LPS‑stimulated MG63 cells  in which NEAT1 was significantly downregulated. LPS upregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3  inhibited the expression of autophagy‑related and osteogenesis‑related proteins  promoted apoptosis and altered the cell cycle  which was partially inhibited by NEAT1 overexpression and promoted by bexarotene. LPS stimulated inflammation in the MG63 cells and inhibited the retinoid X receptor (RXR)‑α to downregulate the expression of NEAT1 and decrease levels of autophagy  which promoted the activation of NLRP3 and the release of inflammatory factors  and impaired the functional activity of osteoblasts  thus promoting the development of inflammation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy inhibition by biotin elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress to differentially regulate adipocyte lipid and protein synthesis.Biotin is an indispensable adipogenic agent  and its ability to coordinate carbohydrate  lipid  and amino acid metabolism sensitizes insulin signaling in adipocytes. This enables the organism to adapt and survive under nutrient stress by synthesis and storage of lipids. Biotin deficiency mimics insulin resistance with alterations in cellular intermediary metabolism. Though the mechanism of lipogenesis is well established across cell types  considering its predisposition to accumulate only lipids  it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism that minimizes the effects of biotin on adipocyte protein synthesis. In order to determine the differential metabolic phenotype by biotin  the primary cultures of adipocytes were induced to differentiate in the presence and absence of excess biotin. Serum pre-incubated with avidin was used to limit biotin availability in cultured cells. Biotin restricts cellular signaling associated with protein synthesis without altering total protein content. The decline in autophagy elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit protein synthesis by eIF2α phosphorylation possibly via accumulation of misfolded/long-lived proteins. Furthermore  the compensatory increase in Unc51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 possibly competes with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and ribosomal p70 S6kinase phosphorylation by mechanistic targets of rapamycin complex 1 to uncouple its effect on protein synthesis. In conclusion  autophagy inhibition by biotin uncouples protein synthesis to promote lipogenesis by eliciting endoplasmic reticulum stress and differential phosphorylation of mechanistic targets of rapamycin complex 1 substrates.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lifestyle factors and high-risk atherosclerosis: Pathways and mechanisms beyond traditional risk factors.Despite major efforts to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) burden with conventional risk factor control  significant residual risk remains. Recent evidence on non-traditional determinants of cardiometabolic health has advanced our understanding of lifestyle-disease interactions. Chronic exposure to environmental stressors like poor diet quality  sedentarism  ambient air pollution and noise  sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress affect numerous traditional and non-traditional intermediary pathways related to ASCVD. These include body composition  cardiorespiratory fitness  muscle strength and functionality and the intestinal microbiome  which are increasingly recognized as major determinants of cardiovascular health. Evidence points to partially overlapping mechanisms  including effects on inflammatory and nutrient sensing pathways  endocrine signalling  autonomic function and autophagy. Of particular relevance is the potential of low-risk lifestyle factors to impact on plaque vulnerability through altered adipose tissue and skeletal muscle phenotype and secretome. Collectively  low-risk lifestyle factors cause a set of phenotypic adaptations shifting tissue cross-talk from a proinflammatory milieu conducive for high-risk atherosclerosis to an anti-atherogenic milieu. The ketone body ß-hydroxybutyrate  through inhibition of the NLRP-3 inflammasome  is likely to be an intermediary for many of these observed benefits. Adhering to low-risk lifestyle factors adds to the prognostic value of optimal risk factor management  and benefit occurs even when the impact on conventional risk markers is discouragingly minimal or not present. The aims of this review are (a) to discuss novel lifestyle risk factors and their underlying biochemical principles and (b) to provide new perspectives on potentially more feasible recommendations to improve long-term adherence to low-risk lifestyle factors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Alteration of Sphingolipids in Biofluids: Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases.Sphingolipids (SL) modulate several cellular processes including cell death  proliferation and autophagy. The conversion of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and the balance between ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)  also known as the SL rheostat  have been associated with oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Research in the last decade has focused on the possibility of targeting the SL metabolism as a therapeutic option; and SL levels in biofluids  including serum  plasma  and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  have been measured in several neurodegenerative diseases with the aim of finding a diagnostic or prognostic marker. Previous reviews focused on results from diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD)  evaluated total SL or species levels in human biofluids  post-mortem tissues and/or animal models. However  a comprehensive review of SL alterations comparing results from several neurodegenerative diseases is lacking. The present work compiles data from circulating sphingolipidomic studies and attempts to elucidate a possible connection between certain SL species and neurodegeneration processes. Furthermore  the effects of ceramide species according to their acyl-chain length in cellular pathways such as apoptosis and proliferation are discussed in order to understand the impact of the level alteration in specific species. Finally  enzymatic regulations and the possible influence of insulin resistance in the level alteration of SL are evaluated.,Autophagy_notLIR

WDR81 Gene Silencing Can Reduce Exosome Levels in Human U87-MG Glioblastoma Cells.Glioblastoma is a very invasive and prevalent brain tumor that affects 15 in 100 000 persons over the age of 70 years. Studies have shown that the expression of the WD repeat domain 81 (WDR81) gene  which is effective in vesicular transport and inhibition of autophagy  is increased in glioblastoma. The decreased autophagy was found to be related to the increased production of exosomes  which is a major factor in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma. The PI-3kinase complex is a pre-autophagic complex that is highly active in the absence of WDR81. The WDR81 gene  as a negative regulator of PI3K activity  prevents autophagy and increases exosome secretion by preventing the formation of the class III PI3K complex. Therefore  targeted reduction of exosomes can be considered an effective strategy for reducing the pathogenesis of glioblastoma. This study aimed to assess the effect of WDR81 gene silencing with siRNA on exosome levels in a U87-MG cell line. Culturing of U87-MG cells was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Thereafter  silencing of WDR81 was performed using WDR81 siRNA  whose gene expression level was determined via real-time qRT-PCR. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay. The exosomes were extracted from a cell culture using the Exocib kit. The size accuracy of the exosomes was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Finally  the protein content and RNA of the exosomes were assessed. WDR81 gene expression of siRNA-transfected cells was decreased to 82% after 24 h compared to the non-transfected control cells. The analysis of the exosomes showed that the concentration of exosomes and their RNA and protein content in the siRNA-transfected cells decreased significantly compared to the non-transfected control cells. No considerable difference was observed in cell viability after transfection with either WDR81-specific siRNAs or scrambled control siRNAs. Our findings showed that silencing the WDR81 gene could reduce the level of exosomes in human U87-MG glioblastoma cells. Therefore  the reduced exosome content may be suggested as a new gene therapy strategy for targeted therapy of glioblastoma by increasing autophagy via activation of PI3KIII. However  more studies are needed in this regard.,Autophagy_notLIR
Fndc-1 contributes to paternal mitochondria elimination in C. elegans.Paternal mitochondria are eliminated following fertilization by selective autophagy  but the mechanisms that restrict this process to sperm-derived organelles are not well understood. FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) is a mammalian mitophagy receptor expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane that contributes to mitochondrial quality control following hypoxic stress. Like FUNDC1  the C. elegans ortholog FNDC-1 is widely expressed in somatic tissues and mediates hypoxic mitophagy. Here  we report that FNDC-1 is strongly expressed in sperm but not oocytes and contributes to paternal mitochondria elimination. Paternal mitochondrial DNA is normally undetectable in wildtype larva  but can be detected in the cross-progeny of fndc-1 mutant males. Moreover  loss of fndc-1 retards the rate of paternal mitochondria degradation  but not that of membranous organelles  a nematode specific membrane compartment whose fusion is required for sperm motility. This is the first example of a ubiquitin-independent mitophagy receptor playing a role in the selective degradation of sperm mitochondria.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuroprotective effects of curcumin through autophagy modulation.Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular degradation process involving lysosomal degradation for the turnover of proteins  protein complexes  and organelles. Defects in autophagy produces impaired intercellular communication and have subsequently been shown to be associated with pathological conditions  including neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin is a polyphenol found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa  which has been shown to exert health benefits  such as antimicrobial  antioxidant  anti-inflammatory  and anticancer effects. There is increasing evidence in the literature revealing that autophagy modulation may provide neuroprotective effects. In light of this  our current review aims to address recent advances in the neuroprotective role of curcumin-induced autophagy modulation  specifically with a particular focus on its effects in Alexander disease  Alzheimer's disease  ischemia stroke  traumatic brain injury  and Parkinson's disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Conserved role of ENDOG in promoting autophagy.ENDOG (endonuclease G)  a mitochondrial endonuclease  is known to participate in apoptosis and paternal mitochondria elimination. However  the role and underlying mechanism of ENDOG in regulating macroautophagy remain unclear. We recently reported that ENDOG released from mitochondria promotes autophagy during starvation  which we demonstrated is evolutionarily conserved across species by performing experiments in human cell lines  mice  <i>Drosophila</i>  and <i>C. elegans</i>. This study demonstrates that ENDOG can be phosphorylated by GSK3B  which enhances the interaction between ENDOG with YWHAG and leads to the release of TSC2 and PIK3C3 from YWHAG  followed by MTOR pathway suppression and autophagy initiation. Additionally  the endonuclease activity of ENDOG is essential for activating the DNA damage response and thus inducing autophagy. Consequently  this study uncovered an exciting new role for ENDOG as a crucial regulator of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Impact of Different Physical Exercises on the Expression of Autophagy Markers in Mice.Although physical exercise-induced autophagy activation has been considered a therapeutic target to enhance tissue health and extend lifespan  the effects of different exercise models on autophagy in specific metabolic tissues are not completely understood. This descriptive investigation compared the acute effects of endurance (END)  exhaustive (ET)  strength (ST)  and concurrent (CC) physical exercise protocols on markers of autophagy  genes  and proteins in the gastrocnemius muscle  heart  and liver of mice. The animals were euthanized immediately (0 h) and six hours (6 h) after the acute exercise for the measurement of glycogen levels  mRNA expression of <i>Prkaa1</i>  <i>Ppargc1a</i>  <i>Mtor</i>  <i>Ulk1</i>  <i>Becn1</i>  <i>Atg5</i>  <i>Map1lc3b</i>  <i>Sqstm1</i>  and protein levels of Beclin 1 and ATG5. The markers of autophagy were measured by quantifying the protein levels of LC3II and Sqstm1/p62 in response to three consecutive days of intraperitoneal injections of colchicine. In summary  for gastrocnemius muscle samples  the main alterations in mRNA expressions were observed after 6 h and for the ST group  and the markers of autophagy for the CC group were increased (i.e.  LC3II and Sqstm1/p62). In the heart  the Beclin 1 and ATG5 levels were downregulated for the ET group. Regarding the markers of autophagy  the Sqstm1/p62 in the heart tissue was upregulated for the END and ST groups  highlighting the beneficial effects of these exercise models. The liver protein levels of ATG5 were downregulated for the ET group. After the colchicine treatment  the liver protein levels of Sqstm1/p62 were decreased for the END and ET groups compared to the CT  ST  and CC groups. These results could be related to diabetes and obesity development or liver dysfunction improvement  demanding further investigations.,Autophagy_notLIR
NOD1 and NOD2 in inflammation  immunity and disease.NOD1 and NOD2 are related intracellular sensors of bacterial peptidoglycan and belong to the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune proteins that play fundamental and pleiotropic roles in host defense against infection and in the control of inflammation. The importance of these proteins is also highlighted by the genetic association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in NOD2 and susceptibility to Crohn's disease  an inflammatory bowel disease. At the cellular level  recent efforts have delineated the signaling pathways triggered following activation of NOD1 and NOD2  and the interplay with various cellular processes  such as autophagy. In vivo studies have revealed the importance of NOD-dependent host defense in models of infection  and a crucial area of investigation focuses on understanding the role of NOD1 and NOD2 at the intestinal mucosa  as this is of prime importance for understanding the etiology of Crohn's disease.,Autophagy_notLIR

Unfortunately  these ARR cells also lack sensitivity to chemotherapy and cause tumor recurrence and metastasis.,Autophagy_notLIR
miR-23b-3p regulates apoptosis and autophagy via suppressing SIRT1 in lens epithelial cells.Age-related cataract is one of the prior causes of blindness and the incidence rates of cataract are even rising. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cataracts. Under oxidative stress  lens epithelial cell (LEC cell) apoptosis is activated  which might lead to the opacity of the lens and accelerate the progression of cataract development. Meanwhile  autophagy is also active to face oxidative stress. miRNAs have been reported to involve cataract. However  the underlying mechanism is not clear. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of miR23b-3p on apoptosis and autophagy in LEC cells under oxidative stress. The expression levels of miR-23b-3p were examined in age-related cataract tissues and LEC cells treated with hydrogen peroxide  showing that miR23b-3p expression levels were upregulated. Knockdown of miR23b-3p expression in LEC cells brought about apoptosis significantly decreased while autophagy significantly increased during hydrogen peroxide. We predicted microRNA miRNA-23b-3p might participate in regulating silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) by bioinformatics database of TargetScan. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miRNA-23b-p could suppress SIRT1 expression by binding its 3'UTR. In addition  overexpression or knockdown of miR-23b-3p could decrease or increase SIRT1 expression  which indicated that Mir-23b-3p could suppress SIRT1 expression. In addition  enhanced SIRT1 could attenuate the regulation of cell apoptosis and autophagy induced by overexpression of miR-23b-3p. Taken together  our findings revealed that miR-23b-3p regulated apoptosis and autophagy via suppressing SIRT1 in LEC cell under oxidative stress  which could provide new ideas for clinical treatment of cataract.,Autophagy_notLIR
MiR-101a-3p Attenuated Pilocarpine-Induced Epilepsy by Downregulating c-FOS.This study aimed to explore the effects and function of microRNA-101a-3p (miR-101a-3p) in epilepsy. Rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy was established and the seizure frequency was recorded. Expression of miR-101a-3p and c-Fos in hippocampus tissues of Rat models were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Besides  we established a hippocampal neuronal culture model of acquired epilepsy using Mg<sup>2+</sup> free medium to evaluate the effects of miR-101a-3p and c-Fos in vitro. Cells were transfected with miR-101a-3p mimic  si-c-FOS  miR-101a-3p + c-FOS and its corresponding controls. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability upon transfection. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the apoptosis rate. Western blot was performed to measure the protein expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2  Bax  and cleaved caspase 3)  autophagy-related proteins (LC3 and Beclin1) and c-FOS. The targeting relationship between miR-101a-3p and c-FOS was predicted and verified by TargetScan software and dual-luciferase reporter assay. The role of miR-101a-3p was validated using epilepsy rat models in vivo. Another Rat models of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy with miR-NC or miR-101a-3p injection were established to evaluate the effect of miR-101a-3p overexpression on epilepsy in vivo. MiR-101a-3p was downregulated while c-FOS was increased in hippocampus tissues of Rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Overexpression of miR-101a-3p or c-FOS depletion promoted cell viability  inhibited cell apoptosis and autophagy. C-FOS was a target of miR-101a-3p and miR-101a-3p negatively regulated c-FOS expression to function in epilepsy. Overexpression of miR-101a-3p attenuated pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in Rats in vivo. This study indicated that miR-101a-3p could attenuate pilocarpine-induced epilepsy by repressing c-Fos expression.,Autophagy_notLIR
Resveratrol regulates the recovery of rat sciatic nerve crush injury by promoting the autophagy of Schwann cells.Resveratrol has the ability to promote functional recovery after sciatic nerve crush injury (SNCI)  though the mechanism through which this occurs in not fully understood. Resveratrol can promote autophagy  a key process in Wallerian degeneration; thus  we hypothesized that resveratrol could promote recovery from SNCI by promoting Schwann cell autophagy and acceleration of Wallerian degeneration. Motor function recovery was assessed by calculating Sciatic Function Indexes (SFIs) at days 7  14  21  28 post SNCI. Autophagy and myelin clearance were assessed by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B) and myelin protein zero (MPZ) immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis on the fourth day after SNCI. The autophagy of Schwann cells following resveratrol administration was quantified by immunofluorescence in RSC96 cells. Immunofluorescence and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were also used in Resveratrol treated sciatic nerve four days post-SNCI to find LC3B positive areas and typical double membrane structures represent for autophagy. The SNCI+resveratrol (crush+Res) groups recovered faster than the SNCI+vehicles (crush+V) group. On day four  almost all of the myelin had regenerated in the crush+Res rats  while the crush+V group's myelin remained intact and the expression levels of LC3-II/I was the highest. On day 28 post-injury  both the control and crush+Res groups' myelin neurofibers reached peak numbers as did the thickness of the myelin sheath. Both in vitro and in vivo immunofluorescence showed that LC3B was colocalized with Schwann cells. This is the first study to observe that resveratrol can promote recovery from SCNI by accelerating the myelin clearance process by promoting autophagy of Schwann cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Occurrence of autophagy during pioneer root and stem development in Populus trichocarpa.Autophagy is involved in developmentally programmed cell death and is identified during the early development of phloem  as well as xylem with a dual role  as both an inducer and executioner of cell death. The regulation of primary and secondary development of roots and stems is important for the establishment of root systems and for the overall survival of trees. The molecular and cellular basis of the autophagic processes  which are used at distinct moments during the growth of both organs  is crucial to understand the regulation of their development. To address this  we use Populus trichocarpa seedlings grown in a rhizotron system to examine the autophagy processes involved in root and stem development. To monitor the visual aspects of autophagy  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunolocalization of AuTophaGy-related protein (ATG8) enabled observations of the phenomenon at a structural level. To gain further insight into the autophagy process at the protein and molecular level  we evaluated the expression of ATG gene transcripts and ATG protein levels. Alternations in the expression level of specific ATG genes and localization of ATG8 proteins were observed during the course of root or stem primary and secondary development. Specifically  ATG8 was present in the cells exhibiting autophagy  during the differentiation and early development of xylem and phloem tissues  including both xylary and extraxylary fibers. Ultrastructural observations revealed tonoplast invagination with the formation of autophagic-like bodies. Additionally  the accumulation of autophagosomes was identifiable during the differentiation of xylem in both organs  long before the commencement of cell death. Taken together  these results provide evidence in support of the dual role of autophagy in developmental PCD. A specific role of the controller of cell death  which is a committed step with the release of hydrolytic enzymes from the vacuole and final digestion of protoplast  from which there is no return once initiated  is only attributed to mega-autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Intra- and Intercellular Silver Nanoparticle Translocation and Transformation in Oyster Gill Filaments: Coupling Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and Dual Stable Isotope Tracing Study.The extensive application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) requires a full examination of their biological impacts  especially in aquatic systems where AgNPs are likely to end up. Despite numerous toxicity studies from molecular to individual levels  it is still a daunting challenge to achieve <i>in situ</i> subcellular imaging of Ag and to determine the sites of AgNP interaction with organelles or macromolecules simultaneously. Here  by coupling high-resolution nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry elemental mapping with scanning electron microscopy ultrastructural characterization  we successfully visualized the subcellular localization and the potential toxicity effects of AgNPs in the oyster gill filaments. The stable isotope tracing method was also adopted to investigate the respective uptake and transport mechanisms of differently labeled <sup>109</sup>AgNPs and <sup>107</sup>Ag<sup>+</sup> ions. <sup>109</sup>Ag hotspots were colocalized with endosomes or lysosomes  proving an endocytosis-based entry of AgNPs which passed through the barrier of oyster gill epithelium. These <sup>109</sup>Ag hotspots showed a strong colocalization with <sup>32</sup>S<sup>-</sup>. For the first time  we provided visualized evidence of AgNP-induced autophagy in the oyster gill cells. We further identified two categories of hemocytes (blood cells) and illustrated their roles in AgNP transport and sequestration. The integration of morphological and functional aspects of Ag subcellular distribution in different target cells suggested that oysters were equipped with a specialized endolysosomal (epithelial cells) or phagolysosomal system (hemocytes) in regulating the cellular process of AgNPs  during which the lysosome was the most involved organelle and sulfur was the most relevant macronutrient element. This study highlighted not only the intracellular but also the intercellular AgNP translocation and transformation  providing important subcellular imaging of silver and reliable methodology regarding bio-nano interactions in natural environments.,Autophagy_notLIR
Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia  and can be modulated by chloroquine.We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes  and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However  the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ.,Autophagy_notLIR
Natural Bioactive Compounds as Emerging Therapeutic Molecules Against Breast Cancer: Emphasis on the Role of Phytoestrogens.Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer in women  which is also hormone- dependent. Depending on the receptor expression  these cancers are subdivided into different forms  and among these receptors  estrogen  progesterone  and Her2 are the important ones.

Eupafolin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiomyocyte autophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.Eupafolin  a major active component of <i>Eupatorium perfoliatum L</i>.  has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is responsible for myocardial depression. A line of evidences revealed that LPS induces autophagy in cardiomyocytes injury. This study aims to evaluate the effects of eupafolin on LPS-induced cardiomyocyte autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
EI24 tethers endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to regulate autophagy flux.Etoposide-induced protein 2.4 (EI24)  located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane  has been proposed to be an essential autophagy protein. Specific ablation of EI24 in neuronal and liver tissues causes deficiency of autophagy flux. However  the molecular mechanism of the EI24-mediated autophagy process is still poorly understood. Like neurons and hepatic cells  pancreatic β cells are also secretory cells. Pancreatic β cells contain large amounts of ER and continuously synthesize and secrete insulin to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Yet  the effect of EI24 on autophagy of pancreatic β cells has not been reported. Here  we show that the autophagy process is inhibited in EI24-deficient primary pancreatic β cells. Further mechanistic studies demonstrate that EI24 is enriched at the ER-mitochondria interface and that the C-terminal domain of EI24 is important for the integrity of the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) and autophagy flux. Overexpression of EI24  but not the EI24-ΔC mutant  can rescue MAM integrity and decrease the aggregation of p62 and LC3II in the EI24-deficient group. By mass spectrometry-based proteomics following immunoprecipitation  EI24 was found to interact with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1)  inositol 1 4 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)  and the outer mitochondrial membrane chaperone GRP75. Knockout of EI24 impairs the interaction of IP3R with VDAC1  indicating that these proteins may form a quaternary complex to regulate MAM integrity and the autophagy process.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting Autophagy by MPT0L145  a Highly Potent PIK3C3 Inhibitor  Provides Synergistic Interaction to Targeted or Chemotherapeutic Agents in Cancer Cells.Anticancer therapies reportedly promote pro-survival autophagy in cancer cells that confers drug resistance  rationalizing the concept to combine autophagy inhibitors to increase their therapeutic potential. We previously identified that MPT0L145 is a PIK3C3/FGFR inhibitor that not only increases autophagosome formation due to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibition but also perturbs autophagic flux via PIK3C3 inhibition in bladder cancer cells harboring FGFR activation. In this study  we hypothesized that combined-use of MPT0L145 with agents that induce pro-survival autophagy may provide synthetic lethality in cancer cells without FGFR activation. The results showed that MPT0L145 synergistically sensitizes anticancer effects of gefitinib and gemcitabine in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells  respectively. Mechanistically  drug combination increased incomplete autophagy due to impaired PIK3C3 function by MPT0L145 as evidenced by p62 accumulation and no additional apoptotic cell death was observed. Meanwhile  drug combination perturbed survival pathways and increased vacuolization and ROS production in cancer cells. In conclusion  the data suggest that halting pro-survival autophagy by targeting PIK3C3 with MPT0L145 significantly sensitizes cancer cells to targeted or chemotherapeutic agents  fostering rational combination strategies for cancer therapy in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Polydopamine-coated Au-Ag nanoparticle-guided photothermal colorectal cancer therapy through multiple cell death pathways.Nanoparticles are emerging as a new therapeutic modality due to their high stability  precise targeting  and high biocompatibility. Branched Au-Ag nanoparticles with polydopamine coating (Au-Ag@PDA) have strong near-infrared absorbance and no cytotoxicity but high photothermal conversion efficiency. However  the photothermal activity of Au-Ag@PDA in vivo and in vitro has not been reported yet  and the mechanism underlying the effects of photothermal nanomaterials is not clear. Therefore  in this study  the colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 and nude mice xenografts were used to observe the photothermal effects of Au-Ag@PDA in vivo and in vitro. The results suggest that Au-Ag@PDA NPs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover  Au-Ag@PDA NP-mediated photothermal therapy inhibited the growth of tumors at doses of 50 and 100 μg in vivo. The mechanisms through which Au-Ag@PDA NPs induced colorectal cancer cell death involved multiple pathways  including caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis  mitochondrial damage  lysosomal membrane permeability  and autophagy. Thus  our findings suggest that Au-Ag@PDA NPs could be used as potential antitumor agents for photothermal ablation of colorectal cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy Modulation in Lymphocytes From COVID-19 Patients: New Therapeutic Target in SARS-COV-2 Infection.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus  causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During virus infection  several pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced  leading to the "cytokine storm." Among these  interleukin (IL)-6  tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)  and IL-1β seem to have a central role in the progression and exacerbation of the disease  leading to the recruitment of immune cells to infection sites. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway involved in different aspects of lymphocytes functionality. The involvement of IL-6  TNF-α  and IL-1β in autophagy modulation has recently been demonstrated. Moreover  preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect lymphocytes  playing a role in the modulation of autophagy. Several anti-rheumatic drugs  now proposed for the treatment of COVID-19  could modulate autophagy in lymphocytes  highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pharmacological Tools to Modulate Autophagy in Neurodegenerative Diseases.Considerable evidences suggest a link between autophagy dysfunction  protein aggregation  and neurodegenerative diseases. Given that autophagy is a conserved intracellular housekeeping process  modulation of autophagy flux in various model organisms have highlighted its importance for maintaining proteostasis. In postmitotic cells such as neurons  compromised autophagy is sufficient to cause accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates  neuronal dysfunction  degeneration  and loss of motor coordination-all hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Reciprocally  enhanced autophagy flux augments cellular and organismal health  in addition to extending life span. These genetic studies not-withstanding a plethora of small molecule modulators of autophagy flux have been reported that alleviate disease symptoms in models of neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the potential of such molecules to be  perhaps  one of the first autophagy drugs for treating these currently incurable diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
ciRS-7 targeting miR-135a-5p promotes neuropathic pain in CCI rats via inflammation and autophagy.Neuropathic pain  caused by damage to the nerve system  is one of the most challenging diseases in the world. Moreover  the etiology remains unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to participate in various biological progress  including neuropathic pain. However  the way circRNAs participate in the progress of neuropathic pain still needs further study. In this research  we established CCI rat models and measured the expression level of ciRS-7 in the spinal dorsal horn in the postoperative rats. The level of ciRS-7 was positively associated with the progress of neuropathic pain. Next  we test the expression of autophagy and inflammation in the CCI rats  and the results indicate that ciRS-7 associates with the progress of neuropathic pain partly by upregulated the expression level of autophagy and inflammation in the CCI rats. Furthermore  we found ciRS-7 regulates neuropathic pain progress by sponging to miR-135a-5p. In CCI rats  inhibiting miR-135a-5p decreases the level of autophagy and inflammation and alleviates neuropathic pain. We present this research that might provide a new insight for neuropathic pain study.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuroinflammation & pre-mature aging in the context of chronic HIV infection and drug abuse: Role of dysregulated autophagy.In the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)  HIV-1 infection has transformed from adeath sentenceto a manageable  chronic disease. Although the lifeexpectancy of HIV+ individuals is comparable to that of the uninfectedsubjects paradoxically  there is increased prevalence ofage-associatedcomorbidities such asatherosclerosis  diabetes  osteoporosis & neurological deficits in the context of HIV infection. Drug abuse is a commoncomorbidityofHIV infection andis often associated withincreased neurological complications. Chronic neuroinflammation (abnormal microglial and astrocyte activation) and neuronal synaptodendritic injury are the features of CNS pathology observed inHIV (+) individualsthat are takingcART & that abuse drugs. Neuroinflammation is thedrivingforceunderlying prematureaging associated with HIV (+) infection  cART and drugs of abuse. Autophagy is a highly conserved process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulated autophagyhas been shown to be linked with abnormal immune responses & aging. Recent emerging evidence implicatesthe role ofHIV/HIV proteins  cART  & abused drugsin disrupting theautophagy process in brain cells such as microglia  astrocytes  and neurons. It can thus be envisioned that co-exposure of CNS cells to HIV proteins  cART and/or abused drugs couldhavesynergistic effects on theautophagy process  thereby leading to exaggerated microglial/astrocyte activation  ultimately  promotingthe aging process. Restoration of autophagic functioncould thusprovide an alternative therapeuticstrategy formitigating neuroinflammation & ameliorating the premature aging process. The current review aims to unravel the role of dysregulated autophagy in the context of single or co-exposure of microglia  astrocytes  and neurons to HIV/HIV proteins  drugs of abuse &/or cART and will also discuss the pathways involved in dysregulated autophagy-mediated neuroinflammation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Microgravity inhibits decidualization via decreasing Akt activity and FOXO3a expression in human endometrial stromal cells.Decidualization is characterized by the differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (eSCs)  which is critical for embryo implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. In the present study  we investigated the possible effect of simulated microgravity (SM) on the process of proliferation and in vitro decidualization using primary human eSCs. Exposure to SM for 36 h decreased the proliferation and migration of eSCs significantly  without inducing cell death and changes in cell cycle progression. The phosphorylation of Akt decreased under SM conditions in human eSCs  accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and FOXO3a. Treatment with Akti  an Akt inhibitor  decreased MMP-2 expression  but not FOXO3a expression. The decreased level of FOXO3a under SM conditions impeded autophagic flux by reducing the levels of autophagy-related genes. In addition  pre-exposure of eSCs to SM significantly inhibited 8-Br-cAMP induced decidualization  whereas restoration of the growth status under SM conditions by removing 8-Br-cAMP remained unchanged. Treatment of human eSCs with SC-79  an Akt activator  restored the reduced migration of eSCs and decidualization under SM conditions. In conclusion  exposure to SM inhibited decidualization in eSCs by decreasing proliferation and migration through Akt/MMP and FOXO3a/autophagic flux.,Autophagy_notLIR
<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>  a New Model Plant for Autophagy Studies.Autophagy is a catabolic process for bulk and selective degradation of cytoplasmic components in the vacuole/lysosome. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ATG</i> genes were identified as essential genes for autophagy  and most <i>ATG</i> genes are highly conserved among eukaryotes  including plants. Although reverse genetic analyses have revealed that autophagy is involved in responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in land plants  our knowledge of its molecular mechanism remains limited. This limitation is partly because of the multiplication of some <i>ATG</i> genes  including <i>ATG8</i>  in widely used model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>  which adds complexity to functional studies. Furthermore  due to limited information on the composition and functions of the <i>ATG</i> genes in basal land plants and charophytes  it remains unclear whether multiplication of <i>ATG</i> genes is associated with neofunctionalization of these genes. To gain insight into the diversification of <i>ATG</i> genes during plant evolution  we compared the composition of <i>ATG</i> genes in plants with a special focus on a liverwort and two charophytes  which have not previously been analyzed. Our results showed that the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> and the charophytes <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> and <i>Chara braunii</i> harbor fundamental sets of <i>ATG</i> genes with low redundancy compared with those of <i>A. thaliana</i> and the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>  suggesting that multiplication of <i>ATG</i> genes occurred during land plant evolution. We also attempted to establish an experimental system for analyzing autophagy in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. We generated transgenic plants expressing fluorescently tagged MpATG8 to observe its dynamics in <i>M. polymorpha</i> and produced autophagy-defective mutants by genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These tools allowed us to demonstrate that MpATG8 is transported into the vacuole in an MpATG2-  MpATG5-  and MpATG7-dependent manner  suggesting that fluorescently tagged MpATG8 can be used as an autophagosome marker in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. <i>M. polymorpha</i> can provide a powerful system for studying the mechanisms and evolution of autophagy in plants.,Autophagy_notLIR
Primary Cilium in Cancer Hallmarks.The primary cilium is a solitary  nonmotile and transitory appendage that is present in virtually all mammalian cells. Our knowledge of its ultrastructure and function is the result of more than fifty years of research that has dramatically changed our perspectives on the primary cilium. The mutual regulation between ciliogenesis and the cell cycle is now well-recognized  as well as the function of the primary cilium as a cellular "antenna" for perceiving external stimuli  such as light  odorants  and fluids. By displaying receptors and signaling molecules  the primary cilium is also a key coordinator of signaling pathways that converts extracellular cues into cellular responses. Given its critical tasks  any defects in primary cilium formation or function lead to a wide spectrum of diseases collectively called "ciliopathies". An emerging role of primary cilium is in the regulation of cancer development. In this review  we seek to describe the current knowledge about the influence of the primary cilium in cancer progression  with a focus on some of the events that cancers need to face to sustain survival and growth in hypoxic microenvironment: the cancer hallmarks.,Autophagy_notLIR
Quantitative analysis of autophagy-related protein LC3B by quantum-dot-based molecular imaging.Autophagy is a process that facilitates the maintenance of intracellular homeostasis by removing unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components. It plays a role in inhibiting tumorigenesis in the early stage of the disease and might promote progression after tumor formation. Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (MAPLC3  better known as LC3)  isoform B (LC3B)  is one of the most commonly used markers of autophagy. The expression of LC3B has been studied in many cancers and was shown to be closely related to tumor progression. Here  we provide detailed experimental steps for the quantitative detection of LC3B expression in cancer tissue by quantum-dot-based molecular imaging. As compared to the traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) employing standard fluorochromes  the present method has a higher signal amplitude and improved sensitivity enabling the accurate quantitative detection  which provides a foundation for functional research and the clinical application of LC3B biomarker.,Autophagy_notLIR
Trehalose Alleviates Crystalline Silica-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis via Activation of the TFEB-Mediated Autophagy-Lysosomal System in Alveolar Macrophages.Silicosis is an occupational lung disease characterized by persistent inflammation and irreversible fibrosis. Crystalline silica (CS) particles are mainly phagocytized by alveolar macrophages (AMs)  which trigger apoptosis  inflammation  and pulmonary fibrosis. Previously  we found that autophagy-lysosomal system dysfunction in AMs was involved in CS-induced inflammation and fibrosis. Induction of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis by transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation can rescue fibrotic diseases. However  the role of TFEB in silicosis is unknown. In this study  we found that CS induced TFEB nuclear localization and increased TFEB expression in macrophages both in vivo and in vitro. However  TFEB overexpression or treatment with the TFEB activator trehalose (Tre) alleviated lysosomal dysfunction and enhanced autophagic flux. It also reduced apoptosis  inflammatory cytokine levels  and fibrosis. Both pharmacologically inhibition of autophagy and TFEB knockdown in macrophages significantly abolished the antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects elicited by either TFEB overexpression or Tre treatment. In conclusion  these results uncover a protective role of TFEB-mediated autophagy in silicosis. Our study suggests that restoration of autophagy-lysosomal function by Tre-induced TFEB activation may be a novel strategy for the treatment of silicosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mechanisms and Functions of Pexophagy in Mammalian Cells.Peroxisomes play essential roles in diverse cellular metabolism functions  and their dynamic homeostasis is maintained through the coordination of peroxisome biogenesis and turnover. Pexophagy  selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes  is a major mechanism for removing damaged and/or superfluous peroxisomes. Dysregulation of pexophagy impairs the physiological functions of peroxisomes and contributes to the progression of many human diseases. However  the mechanisms and functions of pexophagy in mammalian cells remain largely unknown compared to those in yeast. This review focuses on mammalian pexophagy and aims to advance the understanding of the roles of pexophagy in human health and diseases. Increasing evidence shows that ubiquitination can serve as a signal for pexophagy  and ubiquitin-binding receptors  substrates  and E3 ligases/deubiquitinases involved in pexophagy have been described. Alternatively  pexophagy can be achieved in a ubiquitin-independent manner. We discuss the mechanisms of these ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent pexophagy pathways and summarize several inducible conditions currently used to study pexophagy. We highlight several roles of pexophagy in human health and how its dysregulation may contribute to diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pan-Cancer Analysis of PIMREG as a Biomarker for the Prognostic and Immunological Role.Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein interacting mitotic regulator (PIMREG) localizes to the nucleus and can significantly elevate the nuclear localization of clathrin assembly lymphomedullary leukocythemia gene. Although there is some evidence to support an important action for PIMREG in the occurrence and development of certain cancers  currently no pan-cancer analysis of PIMREG is available. Therefore  we intended to estimate the prognostic predictive value of PIMREG and to explore its potential immune function in 33 cancer types. By using a series of bioinformatics approaches  we extracted and analyzed datasets from Oncomine  The Cancer Genome Atlas  Cancer Cell Lineage Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)  to explore the underlying carcinogenesis of PIMREG  including relevance of PIMREG to prognosis  microsatellite instability (MSI)  tumor mutation burden (TMB)  tumor microenvironment (TME) and infiltration of immune cells in various types of cancer. Our findings indicate that PIMREG is highly expressed in at least 24 types of cancer  and is negatively correlated with prognosis in major cancer types. In addition  PIMREG expression was correlated with TMB in 24 cancers and with MSI in 10 cancers. We revealed that PIMREG is co-expressed with genes encoding major histocompatibility complex  immune activation  immune suppression  chemokine and chemokine receptors. We also found that the different roles of PIMREG in the infiltration of different immune cell types in different tumors. PIMREG can potentially influence the etiology or pathogenesis of cancer by acting on immune-related pathways  chemokine signaling pathway  regulation of autophagy  RIG-I like receptor signaling pathway  antigen processing and presentation  FC epsilon RI pathway  complement and coagulation cascades  T cell receptor pathway  NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and other immune-related pathways. Our study suggests that PIMREG can be applied as a prognostic marker in a variety of malignancies because of its role in tumorigenesis and immune infiltration.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition as a Possible Therapeutic Target in Fibrotic Disorders.Fibrosis is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix  which leads to scarring and loss of function of the affected organ or tissue. Indeed  the fibrotic process affects a variety of organs and tissues  with specific molecular background. However  two common hallmarks are shared: the crucial role of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and the involvement of the inflammation process  that is essential for initiating the fibrotic degeneration. TGF-β in particular but also other cytokines regulate the most common molecular mechanism at the basis of fibrosis  the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). EMT has been extensively studied  but not yet fully explored as a possible therapeutic target for fibrosis. A deeper understanding of the crosstalk between fibrosis and EMT may represent an opportunity for the development of a broadly effective anti-fibrotic therapy. Here we report the evidences of the relationship between EMT and multi-organ fibrosis  and the possible therapeutic approaches that may be developed by exploiting this relationship.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ultra-small platinum nanoparticles on gold nanorods induced intracellular ROS fluctuation to drive megakaryocytic differentiation of leukemia cells.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a kind of hematological malignancy featured with retarded differentiation that is highly linked to the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work  ultra-small platinum nanoparticles deposited on gold nanorods (Au@Pt) were synthesized and applied on the CML cells. It was shown that Au@Pt had multienzyme-like activities that induced a fluctuation of the intracellular ROS level over the incubation time  depending on their temporal locations in the cells. The ROS fluctuation triggered cellular autophagy and enhanced the level of autophagic protein Beclin-1  which caused the degradation of fusion protein BCR-ABL  the key factor of retarded differentiation and led to the downregulation of phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. These interactions together broke retarded differentiation and drove the CML cells to differentiate towards megakaryocytes  which is of great significance in enhancing leukemic cell apoptosis. Therefore  Au@Pt exhibited a novel function and promising therapeutic potential for the CML treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Research advances in the secondary resistance mechanism of imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors].Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. Though surgical resection is the only radical treatment  postoperative recurrence and metastasis often occur. The first-line therapy for the treatment of recurrent  metastatic and unresectable GIST is imatinib. More than 80% of patients can benefit from imatinib treatment  but half of patients will still have recurrence or metastasis within 2 years after treatment initiation  and secondary drug resistance is a major cause of disease progression. Therefore  adeep understanding of the mechanisms of secondary drug resistance will guide us to develop personalized therapeutic schedule in the future. This article describes the mechanism of IM secondary resistance from the aspects of gene alteration  abnormal activation of signal transduction pathway  autophagy  apoptosis and drug concentration. It is found that single drug therapy has certain limitations in patients with secondary resistance to IM. Using IM combined with downstream signaling molecule inhibitors  autophagy inhibitors  insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors  heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors  cytotoxic T lymphocyte - associated antigen - 4 (CTLA - 4) antibodies and mitochondrial inhibitors provide us new therapeutic ideas. However  these combination treatments are still in the research phase  and further trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy. With the gradual deepening of research on drug resistance mechanisms  it will provide more solutions to the current serious drug resistance problem.,Autophagy_notLIR
Advances in low-frequency ultrasound combined with microbubbles in targeted tumor therapy.The development of low-frequency ultrasound imaging technology and the improvement of ultrasound contrast agent production technology mean that they play an increasingly important role in tumor therapy.

Melatonin Enhances Autophagy and Reduces Apoptosis to Promote Locomotor Recovery in Spinal Cord Injury via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to neuronal death resulting in central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction; however  the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Melatonin (MT)  a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland  is associated with neuroprotective effects against SCI. Enhanced autophagy can promote the recovery of locomotor function and reduce apoptosis after SCI. Interestingly  MT increases autophagy in SCI in vivo. Nevertheless  the ability of MT to increase autophagy and decrease apoptosis  and the potential effects on the recovery of motor neurons in the anterior horn after SCI remain to be clarified. In this study  we discovered that MT treatment improved motor function recovery in a rat SCI model. Indeed  MT upregulated the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  while expression of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was downregulated after SCI. Additionally  MT increased the expression of autophagy-activating proteins  while the expression of apoptosis-activating proteins in neurons was decreased following SCI. Furthermore  autophagy was inhibited  while apoptosis was induced in SCI model rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary neurons by treatment with MT  the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Collectively  our results suggest that MT can improve the recovery of locomotor function by enhancing autophagy as well as reducing apoptosis after SCI in rats  probably via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cell death induced autophagy contributes to terminal differentiation of skin and skin appendages.In the adult mammalian skin  cells are constantly renewing  differentiating and moving upward  to finally die in a yet not fully understood manner. Here  we provide evidence that macroautophagy/autophagy has a dual role in the skin. In addition to its known catabolic protective role as an evolutionary conserved upstream regulator of lysosomal degradation  we show that autophagy induced cell death (CDA) occurs in epithelial lineage-derived organs  such as the inter-follicular epidermis  the sebaceous- and the Harderian gland. By utilizing GFP-LC3 transgenic and ATG7-deficient mice  we show that CDA is initiated during terminal differentiation at a stage when the cells have become highly resistant to apoptosis. In these transitional cells  the Golgi compartment expands  which accounts for the formation of primary lysosomes  and the nucleus starts to condense. During CDA a burst of autophagosome formation is observed  first the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is phagocytosed followed by autophagy of the nucleus. By this selective form of cell death  most of the cytoplasmic organelles are degraded  but structural proteins remain intact. In the absence of autophagy  consequently  parts of the ER  ribosomes  and chromatin remain. A burst of autophagy was stochastically observed in single cells of the epidermis and collectively in larger areas of ductal cells  arguing for a coordinated induction. We conclude that autophagy is an integral part of cell death in keratinocyte lineage cells and participates in their terminal cell fate.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Atg7: autophagy related 7; BECN1: beclin 1; CDA: cell death-induced autophagy; Cre: Cre-recombinase; DAPI: 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ER: endoplasmatic reticulum; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HaGl: haderian gland; IVL: involucrin; KRT14: keratin 14; LD: lipid droplet; LSM: laser scanning microscope; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; PN: perinuclear space; RB: residual body; rER: rough endoplasmatic reticulum; SB: sebum; SG-SC: stratum granulosum - stratum corneum; SGl: sebaceous gland; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aurora-B knockdown inhibits osteosarcoma metastasis by inducing autophagy via the mTOR/ULK1 pathway.Autophagy plays an essential role in metastasis of malignancies.

Cholesterol derivatives induce dephosphorylation of the histone deacetylases Rpd3/HDAC1 to upregulate autophagy.Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important for global gene expression and contribute to numerous physiological events. Deacetylase Rpd3 in yeast and its conserved homolog HDAC1 in mammals oppositely regulate autophagy; however  how Rpd3/HDAC1 is regulated to mediate autophagy remains unclear. Here  we showed autophagy occurrence in silkworm (<i>Bombyx mori</i>) required BmRpd3  wherein steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signaling regulated its protein level and nuclear localization negatively. Inhibition of MTOR led to dephosphorylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of BmRpd3/HsHDAC1. Besides  cholesterol  20E  and 27-hydroxycholesterol could all induce massive dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of BmRpd3/HsHDAC1  and thus autophagy by affecting MTORC1 activity. In addition  three phosphorylation sites (Ser392  Ser421  and Ser423) identified in BmRpd3 were conserved in HsHDAC1. Single or triple phosphorylation-site mutation attenuated the phosphorylation levels of BmRpd3/HsHDAC1  leading to their cytoplasmic localization and autophagy activation. In general  cholesterol derivatives  especially hydroxylated cholesterol  caused dephosphorylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of BmRpd3/HsHDAC1 through inhibition of MTOR signaling to facilitate autophagy in <i>B. mori</i> and mammals. These findings improve our understandings of BmRpd3/HsHDAC1-mediated autophagy induced by cholesterol derivatives and shed light on their potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and autophagy-related studies.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 20E: 20-hydroxyecdysone; 27-OH: 27-hydroxycholesterol; ACTB: actin beta; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; Atg: autophagy-related; BmSqstm1: <i>Bombyx</i> sequestosome 1; CQ: chloroquine; HDAC: histone deacetylase; LMNB: Lamin B1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TUBA1A: tubulin alpha 1a.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dormancy and cancer stem cells: An enigma for cancer therapeutic targeting.Dormancy occurs when cells remain viable but stop proliferating. When most of a cancer population undergoes this phenomenon  the result is called tumor dormancy  and when a single cancer cell undergoes this process  it is termed quiescence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) share several overlapping characteristics and signaling pathways with dormant cancer cells  including therapy resistance  and an ability to metastasize and evade the immune system. Cancer cells can be broadly grouped into dormancy-competent CSCs (DCCs)  cancer-repopulating cells (CRCs)  dormancy-incompetent CSCs and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). The settings in which cancer cells exploit the dormancy phase to survive and adapt are: (i) primary cancer dormancy; (ii) metastatic dormancy; (iii) therapy-induced dormancy; and (iv) immunologic dormancy. Dormancy  therapy resistance and plasticity of CSCs are fundamentally interconnected processes mediated through mechanisms involving reversible genetic alterations. Niches including metastatic  bone marrow  and perivascular are known to harbor dormant cancer cells. Mechanisms of dormancy induction are complex and multi-factorial and can involve angiogenic switching  addictive oncogene inhibition  immunoediting  anoikis  therapy  autophagy  senescence  epigenetic  and biophysical regulation. Therapy can have opposing effects on cancer cells with respect to dormancy; some therapies can induce dormancy  while others can reactivate dormant cells. There is a lack of consensus relative to the value of therapy-induced dormancy  i.e.  some researchers view dormancy induction as a beneficial strategy as it can lead to metastasis inhibition  while others argue that reactivating dormant cancer cells and then eliminating them through therapy are a better approach. More focused investigations of intrinsic cell kinetics and environmental dynamics that promote and maintain cancer cells in a dormant state  and the long-term consequences of dormancy are critical for improving current therapeutic treatment outcomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Downregulation of MEG3 promotes neuroblastoma development through FOXO1-mediated autophagy and mTOR-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Our previous studies demonstrated that MEG3 was significantly downregulated in neuroblastoma (NB) and its expression was negatively associated with the INSS stage. Overexpression of MEG3 promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in NB cells. In this study  we discovered more potential functions and molecular mechanisms of MEG3 in NB. According to the database  MEG3 positively correlated with the NB survival rate and was negatively associated with malignant clinical features. Moreover  we determined that MEG3 was mainly located in the nucleus by nuclear-cytoplasmic separation and RNA fish assays. Upregulation of MEG3 in stably transfected cell lines was accomplished  and CCK8  colony formation  and EDU assays were performed  which indicated that MEG3 significantly suppressed cell proliferation. Both wound healing and transwell experiments demonstrated that MEG3 decreased cell migration and invasion. CHIRP enrichments showed the anticancer effects of MEG3 were probably linked to autophagy and the mTOR signaling pathway. LC3 fluorescence dots and western blots showed that MEG3 attenuated autophagy by inhibiting FOXO1  but not the mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore  MEG3 inhibited metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the mTOR signaling pathway. Consistent with the above results  downregulation of MEG3 facilitated NB malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically  MEG3 and EZH2 regulated each other via a negative feedback loop and promoted NB progression together. In conclusion  our findings suggested that MEG3 was a tumor suppressor in NB and could be a potential target for NB treatment in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Co-targeting of lysosome and mitophagy in cancer stem cells with chloroquine analogues and antibiotics.The catabolic autophagy eliminates cytoplasmic components and organelles via lysosomes. Non-selective bulk autophagy and selective autophagy (mitophagy) are linked in intracellular homeostasis both normal and cancer cells. Autophagy has complex and paradoxical dual role in cancers; it can play either tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the tumour type  stage  microenvironment and genetic context. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) cause tumour recurrence and promote resistant to therapy for driving poor clinical consequences. Thus  new healing strategies are urgently needed to annihilate and eradicate CSCs. As chloroquine (CQ) analogues show positive clinical outcome in several clinical trials either standalone or combination with several chemotherapies. Moreover  CQ analogues are known to eliminate CSCs via altering DNA methylation. However  several obstacles such as higher concentrations and dose-dependent toxicity are noticeable in the treatment of cancers. As tumour cells predominantly rely on mitochondrial actions  mitochondrial targeting FDA-approved antibiotics are reported to effectively eradicate CSCs alone or combination with chemotherapy. However  antibiotics cause metabolic glycolytic shift in cancer cells for survival and repopulation. This review will provide a sketch of the inhibiting roles of current chloroquine analogues and antibiotic combination in CSC autophagy process and discuss the possibility that pre-clinical and clinical potential therapeutic strategy for anticancer therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy related 4B  upregulated by HIF-1α  attenuates the sensitivity to cisplatin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.Increasing evidence has shown that autophagy related proteins and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) are both involved in the malignant progress of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)  and HIF-1α plays an emerging role in the chemosensitivity of NPC cells. However  it is still unknown whether autophagy related proteins are associated with HIF-1α in regulating the chemosensitivity of NPC cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
The attenuation of Th1 and Th17 responses via autophagy protects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced sepsis.Whether autophagy affects methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-induced sepsis and the associated mechanisms are largely unknown. This study investigated the role of autophagy in MRSA-induced sepsis. The levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II/I  Beclin-1 and p62 after USA300 infection were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Bacterial burden analysis  hematoxylin-eosin staining  and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed to evaluate the effect of autophagy on MRSA-induced sepsis. IFN-γ and IL-17 were analyzed by ELISA  and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry. Our results showed that LC3-II/I and Beclin-1 were increased  while p62 was decreased after infection. Survival rates were decreased in the LC3B<sup>-/-</sup> and Beclin-1<sup>+/-</sup> groups  accompanied by worsened organ injuries and increased IFN-γ and IL-17 levels  whereas rapamycin alleviated organ damage  decreased IFN-γ and IL-17 levels  and improved the survival rate. However  there was no significant difference in bacterial burden. Flow cytometric analysis showed that rapamycin treatment decreased the frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells  whereas these cells were upregulated in the LC3B<sup>-/-</sup> and Beclin-1<sup>+/-</sup> groups. Therefore  autophagy plays a protective role in MRSA-induced sepsis  which may be partly associated with the alleviation of organ injuries via the downregulation of Th1 and Th17 responses. These results provide a nonantibiotic treatment strategy for sepsis.,Autophagy_notLIR
The long noncoding RNA CTA-941F9.9 is frequently downregulated and may serve as a biomarker for carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the carcinogenesis of many different cancers.

Moreover  we investigated whether this molecule is able to influence carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC).,Autophagy_notLIR
Schwann Cell Autophagy and Necrosis as Mechanisms of Cell Death by <i>Acanthamoeba</i>.Amoebae of the genus <i>Acanthamoeba</i> are etiological agents of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). Recently  through an in vivo GAE model  <i>Acanthamoeba</i> trophozoites were immunolocalized in contact with the peripheral nervous system (PNS) cells-Schwann cells (SC). In this study  we analyzed in greater detail the in vitro early morphological events (1  2  3  and 4 h) during the interaction of <i>A. culbertsoni</i> trophozoites (ATCC 30171) with SC from <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> (ATCC CRL-2941). Samples were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as confocal microscopy. After 1 h of interaction  amoebae were observed to be adhered to the SC cultures  emitting sucker-like structures associated with micro-phagocytic channels. In addition  evidence of necrosis was identified since edematous organelles as well as multivesicular and multilamellar bodies characteristics of autophagy were detected. At 2 h  trophozoites migrated beneath the SC culture in which necrosis and autophagy persisted. By 3 and 4 h  extensive lytic zones were observed. SC necrosis was confirmed by confocal microscopy. We reported for the first time the induction of autophagic and necrotic processes in PNS cells  associated in part with the contact-dependent pathogenic mechanisms of <i>A. culbertsoni</i> trophozoites.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy role in environmental pollutants exposure.During the last decades  the potential harmfulness derived from the exposure to environmental pollutants has been largely demonstrated  with associated damages ranging from geno- and cyto-toxicity to tissue malfunction and alterations in organism physiology. Autophagy is an evolutionarily-conserved cellular mechanism essential for cellular homeostasis  which contributes to protect cells from a wide variety of intracellular and extracellular stressors. Due to its pivotal importance  its correct functioning is directly linked to cell  tissue and organismal fitness. Environmental pollutants  particularly industrial compounds  are able to impact autophagic flux  either by increasing it as a protective response  by blocking it  or by switching its protective role toward a pro-cell death mechanism. Thus  the understanding of the effects of chemicals exposure on autophagy has become highly relevant  offering new potential approaches for risk assessment  protection and preventive measures to counteract the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants on human health.,Autophagy_notLIR
Lighting the way: advances in transcriptional regulation and integrative crosstalk of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes in cassava.The role of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes has been well studied. However  the transcriptional regulation of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes and their integrative crosstalk with other signaling pathways remain elusive. Here  we summarize recent progress in the functional analysis of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes and the major sites of melatonin synthesis in plants. We focus on the dual roles of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes in melatonin biosynthesis and in the crosstalk between melatonin and autophagy  antioxidant signaling  and stress responses in cassava. We highlight the transcriptional regulation and integrative protein complex of melatonin biosynthetic enzymes  and then raise the challenge of uncovering their precise regulation and crosstalk.,Autophagy_notLIR

We therefore propose FAK1 inhibition for current melanoma therapy in AMBRA1-low tumors.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oridonin suppresses autophagy and survival in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.<b>Context:</b> Oridonin exhibits various pharmacological and physiological activities  including antioxidant  antibacterial  anti-inflammatory  pro-apoptotic  anticancer and neurological effects. However  its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is yet to be revealed.<b>Objective:</b> We evaluated the effects of oridonin on the survival and autophagy of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs).<b>Materials and methods:</b> RA-FLSs were treated with oridonin at serial concentrations of 0  2  4  6  8 and 10 µg/mL for 24  48 and 72 h. Then  cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured. A GFP-LC3 plasmid was transfected into the cells to determine autophagy.<b>Results:</b> Oridonin suppressed RA-FLS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of oridonin at 24  48 and 72 h were 8.28  7.88 and 8.35 µg/mL  respectively. Treatment with oridonin for 24 h increased apoptosis by 4.1%  and increased the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 but significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β in the culture supernatant (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition  6 h of oridonin treatment significantly decreased the number of GFP-LC3 punctate dots and inhibited the protein levels of ATG5 and Beclin1 by 80.01% and 42.12%  respectively. Chloroquine (CQ) significantly reinforced the effects of oridonin on inhibition of autophagy  suppression of proliferation  and induction of apoptosis in RA-FLSs (<i>p</i> < 0.05).<b>Conclusions:</b> Our results indicate that treatment with oridonin in combination with CQ inhibits autophagy and cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in RA-FLSs more effectively than treatment oridonin alone. This finding indicates that oridonin is a potential therapeutic agent for RA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Changes of the coronary arteries and cardiac microvasculature with aging: Implications for translational research and clinical practice.Aging results in functional and structural changes in the cardiovascular system  translating into a progressive increase of mechanical vessel stiffness  due to a combination of changes in micro-RNA expression patterns  autophagy  arterial calcification  smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. The two pivotal mechanisms of aging-related endothelial dysfunction are oxidative stress and inflammation  even in the absence of clinical disease. A comprehensive understanding of the aging process is emerging as a primary concern in literature  as vascular aging has recently become a target for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Change of life-style  diet  antioxidant regimens  anti-inflammatory treatments  senolytic drugs counteract the pro-aging pathways or target senescent cells modulating their detrimental effects. Such therapies aim to reduce the ineluctable burden of age and contrast aging-associated cardiovascular dysfunction. This narrative review intends to summarize the macrovascular and microvascular changes related with aging  as a better understanding of the pathways leading to arterial aging may contribute to design new mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to attenuate the features of vascular senescence and its clinical impact on the cardiovascular system.,Autophagy_notLIR
The protective effect of biochanin A against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in mice involves enhancing of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and beclin-1 production.Rotenone is an insecticide that generates oxidative stress in the CNS and induces locomotor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in rodents. Biochanin A [BioA] is an isoflavone with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The antioxidant and the modulatory action of BioA on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagy were tested in rotenone-Parkinsonian mice. Mice were allocated into; Group I: oil control group  Group II: rotenone group [1-mg/kg/48h  subcutaneously]  group III: rotenone and BioA [10-mg/kg]. Rotenone injection resulted in locomotor disturbances in mice  degeneration in dopaminergic neurons [tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells]  low striatal dopamine  increased malondialdehyde and decreased level of glutathione. Neuroinflammation was evidenced by upregulation of astrocytes [glia fibrillary acidic protein  GFAP] and elevated levels of cytokines. The phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the autophagy-related protein  beclin-1  were decreased significantly as indicated by Western blot analysis. BioA treatment enhanced locomotor activity and afforded nigral neuroprotection. The mechanism by which BioA produced this effect includes increased antioxidant defenses  lessened proinflammatory cytokines  increased phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR proteins and upregulated beclin-1. Importantly  BioA suppressed the striatal astrocyte marker [GFAP]. Overall  the currents study highlighted that BioA activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and enhances beclin-1 leading to neuroprotection for nigral dopaminergic neurons.,Autophagy_notLIR
Amino Acid Starvation Sensitizes Resistant Breast Cancer to Doxorubicin-Induced Cell Death.Many clinical trials are beginning to assess the effectiveness of compounds known to regulate autophagy in patients receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy. However  autophagy inhibition  through exogenous inhibitors  or activation  through starvation  has revealed conflicting roles in cancer management and chemotherapeutic outcome. This study aimed to assess the effect of amino acid starvation on doxorubicin-treated breast cancer cells by assessing the roles of autophagy and apoptosis. An <i>in vitro</i> breast cancer model consisting of the normal breast epithelial MCF12A and the metastatic breast cancer MDAMB231 cells was used. Apoptotic and autophagic parameters were assessed following doxorubicin treatments  alone or in combination with bafilomycin  ATG5 siRNA or amino acid starvation. Inhibition of autophagy  through ATG5 siRNA or bafilomycin treatment  increased caspase activity and intracellular doxorubicin concentrations in MCF12A and MDAMB231 cells during doxorubicin treatment. While amino acid starvation increased autophagic activity and decreased caspase activity and intracellular doxorubicin concentrations in MCF12A cells  no changes in autophagic parameters or caspase activity were observed in MDAMB231 cells. Our <i>in vivo</i> data showed that 24 h protein starvation during high dose doxorubicin treatment resulted in increased survival of tumor-bearing GFP-LC3 mice. Results from this study suggest that short term starvation during doxorubicin chemotherapy may be a realistic avenue for adjuvant therapy  especially with regards to the protection of non-cancerous cells. More research is however  needed to fully understand the regulation of autophagic flux during starvation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Isoliquiritigenin inhibits TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis through activating autophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in MRC-5 cells.Isoliquiritigenin (ISL)  a natural flavonoid derived from the root of liquorice  has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Previous studies have found that ISL plays a crucial role in anti-fibrosis of adipose tissue and renal tissue; however  its effect on pulmonary fibrogenesis has not been demonstrated. In this study  we aimed to explore the roles and the underlying mechanisms of ISL in TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis using human lung fibroblast-derived MRC-5 cells. Cell proliferation and migration were determined by MTT and wound healing assay  respectively. The expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)  collagen type I alpha 1 (COLIA1) and fibronectin (FN)  microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and related signaling molecules were detected by quantitative real-time PCR  western blot and immunofluorescence assay  correspondingly. EGFP-LC3 transfection was used for autophagy analysis. The results showed that ISL inhibited the TGF-β1-induced proliferation and migration  and down-regulated the expressions of α-SMA  COLIA1 and FN. ISL treatment led to up-regulation of LC3 in TGF-β1-treated MRC-5 cells  accompanied by significant decrease in the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  protein kinase B (AKT)  and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition  the inhibitory effects of ISL on TGF-β1-induced fibrogenic features in MRC-5 cells were enhanced by pretreatment with autophagy activator Rapmycin and PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 and reversed by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and PI3K/AKT activator IGF-1. Taken together  our results demonstrated that ISL could attenuate the fibrogenesis of TGF-β1-treated MRC-5 cells by activating autophagy via suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore  ISL holds a great potential to be developed as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Collagen VI Muscle Disorders: Mutation Types  Pathogenic Mechanisms and Approaches to Therapy.Mutations in the genes encoding the major collagen VI isoform  COL6A1  COL6A2 and COL6A3  are responsible for the muscle disorders Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. These disorders form a disease spectrum from mild to severe. Dominant and recessive mutations are found along the entire spectrum and the clinical phenotype is strongly influenced by the way mutations impede collagen VI protein assembly. Most mutations are in the triple helical domain  towards the N-terminus and they compromise microfibril assembly. Some mutations are found outside the helix in the C- and N-terminal globular domains  but because these regions are highly polymorphic it is difficult to discriminate mutations from rare benign changes without detailed structural and functional studies. Collagen VI deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction  deficient autophagy and increased apoptosis. Therapies that target these consequences have been tested in mouse models and some have shown modest efficacy in small human trials. Antisense therapies for a common mutation that introduces a pseudoexon show promise in cell culture but haven't yet been tested in an animal model. Future therapeutic approaches await new research into how collagen VI deficiency signals downstream consequences.,Autophagy_notLIR
VDAC1 regulates mitophagy in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal capillary endothelial cells under high-glucose conditions.Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been considered to involve mitochondrial alterations and be related to the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) protein is one of the key proteins that regulates the metabolic and energetic functions of the mitochondria. To explore the involvement of VDAC1 in mitophagy regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation under high-glucose (HG) conditions  this study examined expressions of VDAC1  mitochondrial function and mitophagy-related proteins  and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) cultured with 30 mM of glucose in the presence or absence of mitophagy inhibitor (Mdivi-1) using Western blot. Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were detected using flow cytometry. GFP-tagged pAdTrack-VDAC1 adenovirus was used to overexpress VDAC1. Cell biological behaviors  including proliferation  migration  tubule formation  and apoptosis  were also observed. Our results showed that when compared to the normal glucose and high mannitol groups  increased amounts of mitochondrial fragments  reduced mitochondrial membrane potential  increased expression of mitochondrial fission protein Drp 1  decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn 2  accumulation of mtROS  and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed in the HG group. Meanwhile  HG markedly reduced the protein expressions of PINK1  Parkin and VDAC1. Inhibition of mitophagy reduced PINK1 expression  enhanced NLRP3 expression  but failed to alter VDAC1. VDAC1 overexpression promoted PINK1 expression  inhibited NLRP3 activation and changed the cell biological behaviors under HG conditions. These findings demonstrate that VDAC1-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal capillary endothelial cells under HG conditions  suggesting that VDAC1 may be a potential target for preventing or treating DR.,Autophagy_notLIR
Amla Therapy as a Potential Modulator of Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factors and Physiological Change.There is currently no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD)  the most common form of dementia. It has been proposed  however  that a modest delay in onset can significantly reduce the number of cases. Thus  prevention and intervention strategies are currently the focus of much research. In the search for compounds that potentially confer benefit  the Amla fruit and its extracts have drawn attention. Amla preparations have been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda  with various parts of the plant used to treat a variety of diseases. Here we review many animal-based studies  and some clinical trials  which have shown that Amla  and its extracts  exert many positive effects on dyslipidemia  hyperglycemia  inflammation  oxidative stress  apoptosis  and autophagy  that contribute to AD risk. Collectively  this evidence suggests that Amla may be of value as part of an effective disease-delaying treatment for AD.,Autophagy_notLIR

Exosomes from miR-20b-3p-overexpressing stromal cells ameliorate calcium oxalate deposition in rat kidney.Hyperoxaluria-induced calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition is the key factor in kidney stone formation  for which adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) have been used as a therapeutic treatment. Studies revealed that miR-20b-3p is down-regulated in hypercalciuric stone-forming rat kidney. To investigate whether ADSC-derived miR-20b-3p-enriched exosomes protect against kidney stones  an ethylene glycol (EG)-induced hyperoxaluria rat model and an in vitro model of oxalate-induced NRK-52E cells were established to explore the protective mechanism of miR-20b-3p. The results showed that miR-20b-3p levels were decreased following hyperoxaluria in the urine of patients and in kidney tissues from animal models. Furthermore  treatment with miR-20b-3p-enriched exosomes from ADSCs protected EG-induced hyperoxaluria rats  and cell experiments confirmed that co-culture with miR-20b-3p-enriched exosomes alleviated oxalate-induced cell autophagy and the inflammatory response by inhibiting ATG7 and TLR4. In conclusion  ADSC-derived miR-20b-3p-enriched exosomes protected against kidney stones by suppressing autophagy and inflammatory responses.,Autophagy_notLIR
The MitoNEET Ligand NL-1 Mediates Antileukemic Activity in Drug-Resistant B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.Disease relapse in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)  either due to development of acquired resistance after therapy or because of de novo resistance  remains a therapeutic challenge. In the present study  we have developed a cytarabine (Ara-C)-resistant REH cell line (REH/Ara-C) as a chemoresistance model. REH/Ara-C 1) was not crossresistant to vincristine or methotrexate; 2) showed a similar proliferation rate and cell surface marker expression as parental REH; 3) demonstrated decreased chemotaxis toward bone marrow stromal cells; and 4) expressed higher transcript levels of cytidine deaminase (<i>CDA</i>) and mitoNEET (<i>CISD1</i>) than the parental REH cell line. Based on these findings  we tested NL-1  a mitoNEET inhibitor  which induced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability with a comparable IC<sub>50</sub> value in REH and REH/Ara-C. Furthermore  NL-1 decreased cell viability in six different ALL cell lines and showed inhibitory activity in a hemosphere assay. NL-1 also impaired the migratory ability of leukemic cells  irrespective of the chemoattractant used  in a chemotaxis assay. More importantly  NL-1 showed specific activity in inducing death in a drug-resistant population of leukemic cells within a coculture model that mimicked the acquired resistance and de novo resistance observed in the bone marrow of relapsed patients. Subsequent studies indicated that NL-1 mediates autophagy  and inhibition of autophagy partially decreased NL-1-induced tumor cell death. Finally  NL-1 showed antileukemic activity in an in vivo mouse ALL model. Taken together  our study demonstrates that mitoNEET has potential as a novel antileukemic drug target in treatment refractory or relapsed ALL.,Autophagy_notLIR
Glucosylation by the Legionella Effector SetA Promotes the Nuclear Localization of the Transcription Factor TFEB.Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that requires nutrients from the host for its replication. It has been shown that replicating L. pneumophila prefers amino acids as main sources of carbon and energy. The homeostasis of amino acids in eukaryotic cells is regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB)  which translocates into the nucleus and activates genes for autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Here we show that the Legionella effector SetA causes a robust nuclear translocation of TFEB when exogenously expressed in mammalian cells and that the translocation is dependent on the glucosyltransferase activity of SetA. We further show that SetA directly glucosylates TFEB at multiple sites. Our findings of TFEB glucosylation by SetA may suggest an alternative strategy for exploiting host nutrients in addition to the control of host mTORC1 signaling by L. pneumophila. Our results provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of the delicate TFEB nuclear shuttling.,Autophagy_notLIR
lncRNA C2dat2 facilitates autophagy and apoptosis via the miR-30d-5p/DDIT4/mTOR axis in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is an important pathophysiological process of ischemic stroke associated with various physiological and pathological processes  including autophagy and apoptosis. In this study  we examined the role and mechanism of long noncoding RNA CAMK2D-associated transcript 2 (C2dat2) in regulating CIRI <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. C2dat2 up-regulation facilitated neuronal autophagy and apoptosis induced by CIRI. Mechanistically  C2dat2 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to negatively regulate miR-30d-5p expression. More specifically  miR-30d-5p targeted the 3'-untranslated region of DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) and silenced its target mRNA DDIT4. Additionally  C2dat2 binding with heat shock cognate 70/heat shock protein 90 blocked RNA-induced silencing complex assembly to abolish the miR-30d-5p targeting of DDIT4 and inhibited miR-30d-5p to silence its target mRNA DDIT4. Further analysis showed that C2dat2 knockdown conspicuously inhibited the up-regulation of DDIT4 and Beclin-1 levels and LC3B II/I ratio and the down-regulation of P62 and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/mTOR and phosphorylated-P70S6K/P70S6K ratio in Neuro-2a cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. This study first revealed that C2dat2/miR-30d-5p/DDIT4/mTOR forms a novel signaling pathway to facilitate autophagy and apoptosis induced by CIRI  contributing to the better understanding of the mechanisms of CIRI and enriching the ceRNA hypothesis in CIRI.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Arf-GAP AoGlo3 regulates conidiation  endocytosis  and pathogenicity in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora.Small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family and their activating proteins (Arf-GAPs) regulate mycelial development and pathogenicity in yeast and filamentous fungi; however  little is known about their roles in nematode-trapping (NT) fungi. In this study  an ortholog of Arf-GAP Glo3 (AoGlo3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was characterized in the NT fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. Deletion of the Aoglo3 gene resulted in growth defects and an increase in hyphal septum. Meanwhile  the sporulation capacity of the ΔAoglo3 mutant was decreased by 98%  and 67.1-71.2% spores became gourd or claviform in shape (from obovoid)  which was accompanied by a significant decrease in the spore germination rate. This reduced sporulation capacity correlated with the transcriptional repression of several sporulation-related genes including fluG  rodA  abaA  medA  and lreA. The ΔAoglo3 mutant was also sensitive to several chemical stressors such as Congo red  NaCl  and sorbitol. Additionally  AoGlo3 was found to be involved in endocytosis  and more myelin figures were observed in the ΔAoglo3 mutant than in the wild-type strain  which was consistent with the presence of more autophagosomes observed in the mutant. Importantly  AoGlo3 affected the production of mycelial traps and serine proteases for nematode predation. In summary  AoGlo3 is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes such as mycelial growth  conidiation  environmental adaption  endocytosis  and pathogenicity in A. oligospora.,Autophagy_notLIR
De Novo RNA-seq and Functional Annotation of Haemaphysalis longicornis.Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a hematophagous tick widely distributed in northern China. It not only causes enormous economic loss to animal husbandry  but also as a vector and reservoir of various zoonotic pathogens  it spreads natural focal diseases  such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome  seriously threatening human health. Lack of transcriptomic and genomic data from H. longicornis limits the study of this important medical vector.,Autophagy_notLIR
MicroRNA-421-3p-abundant small extracellular vesicles derived from M2 bone marrow-derived macrophages attenuate apoptosis and promote motor function recovery via inhibition of mTOR in spinal cord injury.Spinal cord injury (SCI) has a very disabling central nervous system impact but currently lacks effective treatment. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are recruited to the injured area after SCI and participate in the regulation of functional recovery with microglia. Previous studies have shown that M2 microglia-derived small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) have neuroprotective effects  but the effects of M2 BMDM-derived sEVs (M2 BMDM-sEVs) have not been reported in SCI treatment.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sp1 Targeted PARP1 Inhibition Protects Cardiomyocytes From Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Downregulation of Autophagy.Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI)  characterized by post-ischemic cardiomyocytes death and reperfusion myocardial damage  is a lethal yet unresolved complication in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Previous studies have demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) participates in the progression of various cardiovascular diseases  and various reports have proved that PARP1 can be a therapeutic target in these diseases  but whether it plays a role in MIRI is still unknown. Therefore  in this study  we aimed to explore the role and mechanism of PARP1 in the development of MIRI. Firstly  we demonstrated that PARP1 was activated during MIRI-induced myocardial autophagy <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover  PARP1 inhibition protected cardiomyocytes from MIRI through the inhibition of autophagy. Next  we discovered that specificity protein1 (Sp1)  as a transcription factor of PARP1  regulates its target gene PARP1 through binding to its target gene promoter during transcription. Furthermore  silencing Sp1 protected cardiomyocytes from MIRI via the inhibition of PARP1. Finally  the functions and mechanisms of PARP1 in the development of MIRI were also verified <i>in vivo</i> with SD rats model. Based on these findings  we concluded that PARP1 inhibition protects cardiomyocytes from MIRI through the inhibition of autophagy  which is targeted by Sp1 suppression. Therefore  the utilization of PARP1 exhibits great therapeutic potential for MIRI treatment in future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitochondrial ALDH2 protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction by suppression of ER stress and autophagy.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  an essential component of outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria  plays a pivotal role in myocardial anomalies in sepsis. Recent evidence depicted an essential role for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in cardiac homeostasis. This study examined the effect of ALDH2 on endotoxemia-induced cardiac anomalies. Echocardiographic  cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> properties were examined. Our results indicated that LPS impaired cardiac contractile function (reduced fractional shortening  LV end systolic diameter  peak shortening  maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening  prolonged relengthening duration  oxidation of SERCA  and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mishandling)  associated with ER stress  inflammation  O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production  increased autophagy  CAMKKβ  phosphorylated AMPK and suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR  the effects of which were significantly attenuated or negated by ALDH2. LPS promoted early endosomal formation (as evidenced by RAB4 and RAB5a)  apoptosis and necrosis (MTT and LDH) while decreasing late endosomal formation (RAB7 and RAB 9)  the effects were reversed by ALDH2. In vitro study revealed that LPS-induced SERCA oxidation  autophagy and cardiac dysfunction were abrogated by ALDH2 activator Alda-1  the ER chaperone TUDCA  the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA  or the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. The beneficial effect of Alda-1 against LPS was nullified by AMPK activator AICAR or rapamycin. CAMKKβ inhibition failed to rescue LPS-induced ER stress. Tunicamycin-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was ameliorated by Alda-1 and autophagy inhibition  the effect of which was abolished by rapamycin. These data suggested that ALDH2 protected against LPS-induced cardiac anomalies via suppression of ER stress  autophagy in a CAMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR-dependent manner.,Autophagy_notLIR
ER stress-linked autophagy stabilizes apoptosis effector PERP and triggers its co-localization with SERCA2b at ER-plasma membrane junctions.Specific molecular interactions that underpin the switch between ER stress-triggered autophagy-mediated cellular repair and cellular death by apoptosis are not characterized. This study reports the unexpected interaction elicited by ER stress between the plasma membrane (PM)-localized apoptosis effector PERP and the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump SERCA2b. We show that the p53 effector PERP  which specifically induces apoptosis when expressed above a threshold level  has a heterogeneous distribution across the PM of un-stressed cells and is actively turned over by the lysosome. PERP is upregulated following sustained starvation-induced autophagy  which precedes the onset of apoptosis indicating that PERP protein levels are controlled by a lysosomal pathway that is sensitive to cellular physiological state. Furthermore  ER stress stabilizes PERP at the PM and induces its increasing co-localization with SERCA2b at ER-PM junctions. The findings highlight a novel crosstalk between pro-survival autophagy and pro-death apoptosis pathways and identify  for the first time  accumulation of an apoptosis effector to ER-PM junctions in response to ER stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autoantibodies against the autophagic protein microtubule-associated light-chain 3 (LC3): Immunocharacterization of an atypical ANA pattern.Autoantibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens are commonly detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cells  and three major staining patterns (nuclear  cytoplasmic  and mitotic) are distinguished. Here  we report an atypical cytoplasmic pattern  not described so far  observed in the serum of a patient with a controversial diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Moreover  for the first time  we have revealed the presence of autoantibodies against the microtubule-associated light-chain 3 (LC3) protein  which plays a key role in the autophagic process. The target antigen has been identified in IIF by means of a competition test using purified anti-LC3 antibodies on HEp-2 cells  and confirmed by Western blot analysis using cellular or recombinant LC3 as antigen  immunoreacted with the patient's serum. The identification of this atypical pattern and the related autoantibody-antigen system sheds new light on autophagy  which is increasingly considered to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune disorders  and could contribute to select more personalized therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Systemic overexpression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 promotes metabolic dysregulation and premature death in mice with accelerated aging.Injection of tissues with senescent cells induces changes that mimic aging  and this process is delayed in mice engineered to eliminate senescent cells  which secrete proinflammatory cytokines  including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (<i>Ccl2</i>). Circulating levels of <i>Ccl2</i> correlate with age  but the impact of <i>Ccl2</i> on tissue homeostasis has not been established. We generated an experimental model by crossbreeding mice overexpressing <i>Ccl2</i> with progeroid mice bearing a mutation in the lamin A (<i>Lmna)</i> gene. Wild-type animals and progeroid mice that do not overexpress <i>Ccl2</i> were used as controls. <i>Ccl2</i> overexpression decreased the lifespan of the progeroid mice and induced the dysregulation of glycolysis  the citric acid cycle and one-carbon metabolism in skeletal muscle  driving dynamic changes in energy metabolism and DNA methylation. This impact on cellular bioenergetics was associated with mitochondrial alterations and affected cellular metabolism  autophagy and protein synthesis through AMPK/mTOR pathways. The data revealed the ability of <i>Ccl2</i> to promote death in mice with accelerated aging  which supports its putative use as a biomarker of an increased senescent cell burden and for the assessment of the efficacy of interventions aimed at extending healthy aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Trehalose as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder resulting primarily from loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. PD is characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates  and evidence suggests that aberrant protein deposition in dopaminergic neurons could be related to the dysregulation of the lysosomal autophagy pathway. The therapeutic potential of autophagy modulators has been reported in experimental models of PD. Trehalose is a natural disaccharide that has been considered as a new candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It has a chaperone-like activity  prevents protein misfolding or aggregation  and by promoting autophagy  contributes to the removal of accumulated proteins. In this review  we briefly summarize the role of aberrant autophagy in PD and the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of this disease. We also discuss reports that used trehalose to counteract the neurotoxicity in PD  focusing particularly on the autophagy promoting  protein stabilization  and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of trehalose.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP)-induced reproductive toxicity involved in placental apoptosis  autophagy and oxidative stress in pregnant mice.Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) has been widely used as plasticizers  and reported causing reproductive toxicity in mammals. However  little is known about the toxic effect on the placenta. In this study  dams were orally administered different doses of TOCP to explore the effect of TOCP on placental development. Results showed that TOCP exposure significantly reduced numbers of implanted embryo  caused atrophy and collapse of ectoplacental cone  and decreased total areas of placenta and numbers of PCNA-positive cells. Expression levels of placental development genes were prominently downregulated in the TOCP-treated groups. Moreover  TOCP administration induced placental apoptosis and autophagy by upregulating P53  Bax  Beclin-1  ratio of LC3 II/LC3 I and Atg5 and downregulating Bcl-2 protein. In addition  TOCP exposure markedly inhibited activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase and increased the production of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde. Collectively  these findings suggest that apoptosis  autophagy and oxidative stress may be involved in the TOCP-induced reproductive toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Anticancer and Antiangiogenic Activities of Novel α-Mangostin Glycosides in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells via Downregulation of c-Met and HIF-1α.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore  exploring effective anticancer agents and their modes of action is essential for the prevention and treatment of HCC. Glycosylation can significantly improve the physicochemical and biological properties of small molecules  such as high solubility  stability increase  and lower toxicity. In the present study  for the first time  we evaluated the anticancer and antiangiogenic activities of α-mangostin-3-<i>O</i>-<i>β</i>-D-2-deoxyglucopyranoside (Man-3DG) and α-mangostin 6-<i>O</i>-<i>β</i>-D-2-deoxyglucopyranoside (Man-6DG)  glycosides of α-mangostin  against human HCC cells. Our results demonstrated that Man-3DG and Man-6DG significantly suppressed the growth of three different HCC cells (Hep3B  Huh7  and HepG2) as well as the migration of Hep3B cells. Furthermore  they induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phases and apoptotic cell death by regulating apoptosis-related proteins of mitochondria in Hep3B cells. Noticeably  Man-3DG and Man-6DG also caused autophagy  while co-treatment of the α-mangostin glycosides with an autophagy inhibitor 3-MA enhanced the inhibitory effect on Hep3B cell growth in comparison to single agent treatment. Moreover  Man-3DG and Man-6DG inhibited the c-Met signaling pathway that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Furthermore  the α-mangostin glycosides decreased Hep3B cell-induced angiogenesis in vitro through the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Notably  Man-6DG more effectively inhibited the growth  tumorsphere formation  and expression of cancer stemness regulators compared to α-mangostin and Man-3DG in 3D spheroid-cultured Hep3B cells. These findings suggest that the α-mangostin glycosides might be promising anticancer agents for HCC treatment with superior pharmacological properties than the parent molecule α-mangostin.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Activation of GPER inhibts proliferation and autophagy in prostatic epithelial cells].<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effect of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) on proliferation and autophagy in prostatic epithelial cells. <b>Methods:</b> Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay was used to observe the growth of BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cells after treating with or not with estradiol or GPER selective agonist G1. Autophagy was quantified with Western blot and Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit after treating with estradiol  G1 or both G1 and G15 in the same cells. <b>Results:</b> The OD value in estrogen group and G1 group was significantly lower than those in control group (<i>P<</i>0.01). Compared with control group  Western blot and Cyto-ID green reagent staining revealed that the ratio of LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ and the relative fluorescence intensity of BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cells were decreased in G1 group and estradiol group (<i>P<</i>0.01). Pretreatment with G15 reversed the effect of G1 (<i>P<</i>0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The activation of GPER leads to the inhibition of autophagy and cell proliferation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Adaptive immunity at the crossroads of autophagy and metabolism.The function of lymphocytes is dependent on their plasticity  particularly their adaptation to energy availability and environmental stress  and their protein synthesis machinery. Lymphocytes are constantly under metabolic stress  and macroautophagy/autophagy is the primary metabolic pathway that helps cells overcome stressors. The intrinsic role of autophagy in regulating the metabolism of adaptive immune cells has recently gained increasing attention. In this review  we summarize and discuss the versatile roles of autophagy in regulating cellular metabolism and the implications of autophagy for immune cell function and fate  especially for T and B lymphocytes.,Autophagy_notLIR
AMPK and Autophagy.AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts as an energy sensor in cells and plays a key role in the upregulation of catabolism and inactivation of anabolism. Under various physiological and pathological conditions  AMPK can be phosphorylated by an upstream kinase and bind to AMP or ADP rather than ATP  leading to its activation. Activated AMPK regulates a variety of metabolic processes  including autophagy. AMPK promotes autophagy directly by phosphorylating autophagy-related proteins in the mTORC1  ULK1  and PIK3C3/VPS34 complexes or indirectly by regulating the expression of autophagy-related genes downstream of transcription factors such as FOXO3  TFEB  and BRD4. AMPK can also upregulate the autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy)  as it can induce fragmentation of damaged mitochondria in the network and promote the translocation of the autophagy machinery to damaged mitochondria. In this section  we will detail the molecular structure of AMPK  how its activity is regulated  and its pivotal role in regulating autophagy and mitophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Klotho-mediated changes in the expression of Atg13 alter formation of ULK1 complex and thus initiation of ER- and Golgi-stress response mediated autophagy.In the previous paper of our group  we have demonstrated that one of the crucial factors involved in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is klotho protein. We have shown that klotho silencing in normal human fibroblasts intensifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced p-eIF2a-mediated stress of endoplasmic reticulum and thus leads to retardation of prosurvival autophagy and induction of apoptotic cell death. In this study  we have performed a detailed step-by-step analysis of autophagy flux-related genes' expression and endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stress related pathways in order to determine the exact mechanistic event when autophagy is inhibited in klotho-deficient cells on account of apoptosis initiation. We provide evidence that klotho-silencing in LPS-treated cells results in differential course of ER- and Golgi-mediated stress response. Further  we show that in klotho-deficient cells formation of ULK1 complex is inhibited and thus autophagy initiation is blocked on the account of apoptosis activation  while in the control cells cytoprotective autophagy is activated. Finally  in klotho-deficient cells formation of ULK1 complex is prevented by downregulated expression of Atg13. Thus  this study suggests a novel targeting pathway for efficient elimination of autophagy-deficient cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
CUL3 (cullin 3)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1 (beclin 1) inhibit autophagy and promote tumor progression.Macroautophagy/autophagy plays an important role during the development of human cancer. BECN1 (beclin 1)  a core player in autophagy regulation  is downregulated in many kinds of malignancy. The underlying mechanism  however  has not been fully illuminated. Here  we found that CUL3 (cullin 3)  an E3 ubiquitin ligase  could interact with BECN1 and promote the K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of this protein; In addition  CUL3 led to a decrease in autophagic activity through downregulating BECN1. We also found that KLHL38 was a substrate adaptor of the CUL3 E3 ligase complex-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1. In breast and ovarian cancer  CUL3 could promote the proliferation of tumor cells  and the expression of CUL3 was related to poor prognosis in patients. Our study reveals the underlying mechanism of BECN1 ubiquitination and degradation that affects autophagic activity and subsequently leads to tumor progression  providing a novel therapeutic strategy that regulates autophagy to combat cancer.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related BECN1: beclin 1 CHX: cycloheximide CoIP: co-immunoprecipitation CUL3: cullin 3 IP: immunoprecipitation MS: mass spectrometry PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.,Autophagy_notLIR
Elevation of FGD5-AS1 contributes to cell progression by improving cisplatin resistance against non-small cell lung cancer cells through regulating miR-140-5p/WEE1 axis.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common lung cancer with high mortality worldwide. Cisplatin (DDP) resistance is a huge limitation for NSCLC therapy. FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) was recognized as a significant cancer cell regulator. However  the molecular mechanism of FGD5-AS1 in cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells is poorly understood. FGD5-AS1 and WEE1 expression were up-regulated in DDP-resistant tumors and cells compared with DDP-sensitive ones. Interestingly  down-regulation of FGD5-AS1 or WEE1 inhibited cell proliferation  migration  invasion  autophagy and stimulated cell apoptosis in NSCLC DDP-resistant cells. What's more  restoration of WEE1 abrogated FGD5-AS1 silencing-induced suppression on cell proliferation  migration  invasion  autophagy and promotion on cell apoptosis in NSCLC DDP-resistant cells. Next  we discovered that FGD5-AS1 was able to enhance WEE1 expression by interacting with miR-140-5p. Furthermore  FGD5-AS1 silencing restrained tumor growth of cisplatin-resistant mice. Overexpression of FGD5-AS1 accelerated cell proliferation  migration  invasion and autophagy by enhancing cisplatin resistance against NSCLC cells through miR-140-5p/WEE1 axis  presenting promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of DDP-resistant NSCLC patients.,Autophagy_notLIR

Perturbation of bulk and selective macroautophagy  abnormal UPR activation and their interplay pave the way to immune dysfunction  cancerogenesis and neurodegeneration in ageing.A plethora of studies has indicated that ageing is characterized by an altered proteostasis  ROS accumulation and a status of mild/chronic inflammation  in which macroautophagy reduction and abnormal UPR activation play a pivotal role. The dysregulation of these inter-connected processes favors immune dysfunction and predisposes to a variety of several apparently unrelated pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Given the progressive ageing of the population  a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating autophagy  UPR and their interplay is needed in order to design new therapeutic strategies able to counteract the effects of ageing and concomitantly restrain the onset/progression of age-related diseases that represent a private and public health problem.,Autophagy_notLIR
Beclin-1-Dependent Autophagy of Left Ventricular Cardiomyocytes in SHR and Wistar-Kyoto Rats with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.Autophagy is considered as a mechanism of progression of heart failure  but under certain conditions  it can also act as an adaptation mechanism. Beclin-1 plays the key role in autophagy. We studied the features of Beclin-1 expression in cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle in arterial hypertension  type 1 diabetes mellitus  and their combination. The experiment was performed on male 38-week-old Wistar Kyoto rats and SHR rats aged 38 and 57 weeks. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was modeled by a single parenteral administration of streptozotocin. Expression of Beclin-1 in cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. In arterial hypertension  a decrease in the intensity of Beclin-1-dependent autophagy of cardiomyocytes was seen  while in combined pathology  we observed an opposite effect manifested as a significant increase in the expression of protein Beclin-1.,Autophagy_notLIR
Research progress of mTOR inhibitors.Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved Serine/Threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase  which belongs to phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) protein family. mTOR exists as two types of protein complex: mTORC1 and mTORC2  which act as central controller regulating processes of cell metabolism  growth  proliferation  survival and autophagy. The mTOR inhibitors block mTOR signaling pathway  producing anti-inflammatory  anti-proliferative  autophagy and apoptosis induction effects  thus mTOR inhibitors are mainly used in cancer therapy. At present  mTOR inhibitors are divided into four categories: Antibiotic allosteric mTOR inhibitors (first generation)  ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors (second generation)  mTOR/PI3K dual inhibitors (second generation) and other new mTOR inhibitors (third generation). In this article  these four categories of mTOR inhibitors and their structures  properties and some clinical researches will be introduced. Among them  we focus on the structure of mTOR inhibitors and try to analyze the structure-activity relationship. mTOR inhibitors are classified according to their chemical structure and their contents are introduced systematically. Moreover  some natural products that have direct or indirect mTOR inhibitory activities are introduced together. In this article  we analyzed the target  binding mode and structure-activity relationship of each generation of mTOR inhibitors and proposed two hypothetic scaffolds (the inverted-Y-shape scaffold and the C-shape scaffold) for the second generation of mTOR inhibitors. These findings may provide some help or reference for drug designing  drug modification or the future development of mTOR inhibitor.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ganoderic Acid A Promotes Amyloid-β Clearance (In Vitro) and Ameliorates Cognitive Deficiency in Alzheimer's Disease (Mouse Model) through Autophagy Induced by Activating Axl.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused by amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the central nervous system due to deficient clearance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ganoderic acid A (GAA) on Aβ clearance in microglia and its anti-AD activity. Aβ degradation in BV2 microglial cells was determined using an intracellular Aβ clearance assay. GAA stimulated autophagosome formation via the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Axl)/RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) pathway was determined by Western blot analyses  and fluorescence-labeled Aβ42 was localized in lysosomes in confocal laser microscopy images. The in vivo anti-AD activity of GAA was evaluated by object recognition and Morris water maze (MWM) tests in an AD mouse model following intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Aβ42. The autophagy level in the hippocampus was assayed by immunohistochemical assessment against microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light-chain 3B (LC3B). Intracellular Aβ42 levels were significantly reduced by GAA treatment in microglial cells. Additionally  GAA activated autophagy according to increased LC3B-II levels  with this increased autophagy stimulated by upregulating Axl and Pak1 phosphorylation. The effect of eliminating Aβ by GAA through autophagy was reversed by R428  an Axl inhibitor  or IPA-3  a Pak1 inhibitor. Consistent with the cell-based assay  GAA ameliorated cognitive deficiency and reduced Aβ42 levels in an AD mouse model. Furthermore  LC3B expression in the hippocampus was up-regulated by GAA treatment  with these GAA-specific effects abolished by R428. GAA promoted Aβ clearance by enhancing autophagy via the Axl/Pak1 signaling pathway in microglial cells and ameliorated cognitive deficiency in an AD mouse model.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular Action of Polyphenols in Leukaemia and Their Therapeutic Potential.Leukaemia is a malignant disease of the blood. Current treatments for leukaemia are associated with serious side-effects. Plant-derived polyphenols have been identified as potent anti-cancer agents and have been shown to work synergistically with standard chemotherapy agents in leukaemia cell lines. Polyphenols have multiple mechanisms of action and have been reported to decrease cell proliferation  arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase (3  8 and 9); the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. Polyphenols have been shown to suppress activation of transcription factors  including NF-kB and STAT3. Furthermore  polyphenols have pro-oxidant properties  with increasing evidence that polyphenols inhibit the antioxidant activity of glutathione  causing oxidative DNA damage. Polyphenols also induce autophagy-driven cancer cell death and regulate multidrug resistance proteins  and thus may be able to reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents. This review examines the molecular mechanism of action of polyphenols and discusses their potential therapeutic targets. Here  we discuss the pharmacological properties of polyphenols  including their anti-inflammatory  antioxidant  anti-proliferative  and anti-tumour activities  and suggest that polyphenols are potent natural agents that can be useful therapeutically; and discuss why data on bioavailability  toxicity and metabolism are essential to evaluate their clinical use.,Autophagy_notLIR
Isodunnianol alleviates doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury by activating protective autophagy.Recurrent cardiotoxicity limits the clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX); however the detailed molecular mechanism of DOX cardiotoxicity remains unclear. In the current study  we found that a natural product extracted from Illicium verum  isodunnianol (IDN)  mitigates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating autophagy and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. DOX suppressed protective autophagy and induced apoptosis in H9C2 cardiac myoblasts. Additionally  IDN demonstrated up-regulated autophagy and reduced apoptosis through the activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway. In addition  the beneficial effects of IDN on DOX which induced myocardial injury were dependent on AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation. Similar results were also observed in a DOX-induced cardiotoxicity rat model. The combination of IDN and DOX resulted in decreased apoptosis and inflammatory myocardial fibrosis compared to the DOX mono-treatment group. In summary  our findings provide novel insights into the prevention of DOX-related toxicity by isodunnianol  a food source natural product  warranting further investigation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dietary Mitophagy Enhancer: A Strategy for Healthy Brain Aging?Recently  nutritional interventions have received attention as promising approaches to promote human health during a lifespan. The Mediterranean and Okinawan diets have been associated with longevity and decreasing risk for age-related diseases in contrast to the Western diet. The effect might be due to several antioxidative bioactive compounds highly consumed in both diets  namely  resveratrol  hydroxytyrosol  oleuropein  curcumin  and spermidine. This review aims to address the underlying mechanisms of these compounds to enhance mental fitness throughout life with a focus on brain mitophagy. Mitophagy is the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional  redundant  and aged mitochondria. In aging and neurodegenerative disorders  mitophagy is crucial to preserve the autophagy mechanism of the whole cell  especially during oxidative stress. Growing evidence indicates that curcumin  astaxanthin  resveratrol  hydroxytyrosol  oleuropein  and spermidine might exert protective functions via antioxidative properties and as well the enhanced induction of mitophagy mediators. The compounds seem to upregulate mitophagy and thereby alleviate the clearance of dysfunctional and aged mitochondria as well as mitogenesis. Thus  the Mediterranean or Okinawan diet could represent a feasible nutritional approach to reduce the risk of developing age-related cognitive impairment and corresponding disorders via the stimulation of mitophagy and thereby ensure a balanced redox state of brain cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of <i>Wdr45b</i> in maintaining neural autophagy and cognitive function.Macroautophagy/autophagy functions as a quality control mechanism by degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles and plays an essential role in maintaining neural homeostasis. The phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effector Atg18 is essential for autophagosome formation in yeast. Mammalian cells contain four Atg18 homologs  belonging to two subclasses  WIPI1 (WD repeat domain  phosphoinositide interacting 1)  WIPI2 and WDR45B/WIPI3 (WD repeat domain 45B)  WDR45/WIPI4. The role of <i>Wdr45b</i> in autophagy and in neural homeostasis  however  remains unknown. Recent human genetic studies have revealed a potential causative role of <i>WDR45B</i> in intellectual disability. Here we demonstrated that mice deficient in <i>Wdr45b</i> exhibit motor deficits and learning and memory defects. Histological analysis reveals that <i>wdr45b</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibit a large number of swollen axons and show cerebellar atrophy. SQSTM1- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates  which are autophagy substrates  accumulate in various brain regions in <i>wdr45b</i> KO mice. Double KO mice  <i>wdr45b</i> and <i>wdr45</i>  die within one day after birth and exhibit more severe autophagy defects than either of the single KO mice  suggesting that these two genes act cooperatively in autophagy. Our studies demonstrated that WDR45B is critical for neural homeostasis in mice. The <i>wdr45b</i> KO mice provide a model to study the pathogenesis of intellectual disability.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACSF: artificial cerebrospinal fluid; AMC: aminomethylcoumarin; BPAN: beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration; CALB1: calbindin 1; CNS: central nervous system; DCN: deep cerebellar nuclei; fEPSP: field excitatory postsynaptic potential; IC: internal capsule; ID: intellectual disability; ISH: <i>in situ</i> hybridization; KO: knockout; LTP: long-term potentiation; MBP: myelin basic protein; MGP: medial globus pallidus; PtdIns3P: phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; WDR45B: WD repeat domain 45B; WIPI1: WD repeat domain  phosphoinositide interacting 1; WT: wild type.,Autophagy_notLIR

The Host Autophagy During <i>Toxoplasma</i> Infection.Autophagy is an important homeostatic mechanism  in which lysosomes degrade and recycle cytosolic components. As a key defense mechanism against infections  autophagy is involved in the capture and elimination of intracellular parasites. However  intracellular parasites  such as <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>  have developed several evasion mechanisms to manipulate the host cell autophagy for their growth and establish a chronic infection. This review provides an insight into the autophagy mechanism used by the host cells in the control of <i>T. gondii</i> and the host exploitation by the parasite. First  we summarize the mechanism of autophagy  xenophagy  and LC3-associated phagocytosis. Then  we illustrate the process of autophagy proteins-mediated <i>T. gondii</i> clearance. Furthermore  we discuss how the parasite blocks and exploits this process for its survival.,Autophagy_notLIR
Aging membranes: Unexplored functions for lipids in the lifespan of the central nervous system.Lipids constitute a significant group of biological metabolites and the building blocks of all cell membranes. The abundance and stoichiometries of different lipid species are known to vary across the lifespan and metabolic state  yet the functional effects of these changes have been challenging to understand. Here we review the potentially powerful intersection of lipid metabolism  which determines membrane composition  and aging. We first introduce several key lipid classes that are associated with aging and aging-related disease  where they are found in organisms  and how they act on membrane structure and function. Instead of neutral lipids  which have primary roles in energy storage and homeostasis  we review known functions for polar lipids that control the physicochemical properties of cell membranes. We then focus on aging processes in the central nervous system (CNS)  which is enriched in lipids and is highly dependent on membrane structure for function. Recent studies show how lipids act not just as biomarkers of aging and associated changes in the CNS  but as direct mediators of these processes. As a model system  we explore how fatty acid composition in the retina impact aging and aging-related disease. We propose that the biophysical effects of membrane structure on fundamental eukaryotic processes - mitochondrial respiration and autophagy - provide avenues by which lipid dysregulation can accelerate aging processes. Finally  we lay out ways in which an increased understanding of lipid membrane biology can be applied to studies of aging and lifespan.,Autophagy_notLIR
Retinal Bioenergetics: New Insights for Therapeutics.With 329 genes known to be involved in inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs)  focus has shifted to generic targets for therapeutics  targets that could provide benefit irrespective of the underlying genetic condition. As one of the most energy-demanding tissues  the retina is acutely sensitive to dysfunction of its energy metabolism. Recent discoveries have shed light on the complex interconnectivity and interdependence of retinal cells on their choice metabolic pathways  highlighting a number of potential targets that could benefit cells in a mutation-independent manner. Some of the latest research on retinal metabolism and mitophagy in photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium is discussed  as is how these insights could potentially be used in the design of new therapies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Tetramethylpyrazine ameliorates hepatic fibrosis through autophagy-mediated inflammation.Imbalanced immune response and hepatic fibrosis are key factors related to the progression of chronic liver diseases. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP)  a natural alkaloid  has been widely used for treating liver injury. In this study  we explored the effect of TMP on hepatic fibrosis and the related mechanisms regulating autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Copper induces hepatocyte autophagy via the mammalian targets of the rapamycin signaling pathway in mice.Although copper is among the indispensable trace elements in animal physiological processes  it exerts toxicity upon over-exposure. The present study aimed to investigate hepatocyte autophagy induced by CuSO<sub>4</sub> and its potential mechanism. A total of 240 ICR mice (four-week-old  120 males and 120 females) were randomly divided into four groups  in which mice separately received 0  4  8  and 16 mg/kg of Cu (Cu<sup>2+</sup>-CuSO<sub>4</sub>) for 42 d. The results of increased autophagosomes and autophagy marker LC3B brown cell staining showed that excessive intake of Cu enhanced hepatocyte autophagy. Simultaneously  Cu inhibited the activity of mTOR through suppressing mRNA and protein expressions in mTOR  which in turn up-regulated expression levels of ULK1 and initiated autophagy. Also  over-exposure to Cu increased mRNA and protein expressions of Beclin1  Atg12  Atg5  Atg16L1  Atg7  Atg3  and LC3 and decreased mRNA and protein expressions of p62. These results indicate that excess Cu can enhance hepatocyte autophagy via inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway and regulating mRNA and protein expressions of factors implicated to autophagy in mice.,Autophagy_notLIR
Protein methylation functions as the posttranslational modification switch to regulate autophagy.Studies over the past decades have elucidated the critical role of autophagy in human health and diseases. Although the processes of autophagy in the cytoplasm have been well studied  the posttranscriptional and epigenetic regulation mechanisms of autophagy are still poorly understood. Protein methylation  including histone methylation and non-histone protein methylation  is the most important type of posttranscriptional and epigenetic modification. Recent studies have shown that protein methylation is associated with effects on autophagosome formation  autophagy-related protein expression  and signaling pathway activation  but the details are still unclear. Thus  it is important to summarize the current status and discuss the future directions of research on protein methylation in the context of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
ROS accumulation contributes to abamectin-induced apoptosis and autophagy via the inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TM3 Leydig cells.Abamectin (ABA) as one of the worldwide used compounds in agriculture has raised safety concerns on nontarget organism toxicity. However  the study of male reproductive system damage caused by ABA remains unclear. Our aim is to investigate the effect of ABA-induced cytotoxicity in TM3 Leydig cells and their underlying mechanisms. ABA inhibits TM3 cell viability and proliferation via cell cycle arrested in the G0/G1 phase. In addition  ABA-induced mitochondrial depolarization leads to an imbalance in Bcl-2 family expression  causing caspase-dependent apoptosis in TM3 cells. The increased ratio of cells expression LC3 protein and LC3-II to LC3-I indicated the activation of autophagy potentially. Further experiments revealed ABA treatment reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation  and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation. Pretreatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor  LY294002  mimicked the ABA-mediated effects on cytotoxicity. Pretreatment with a PI3K/AKT agonist  insulin-like growth factor-1  reversed the effects of ABA. ABA caused the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increased intensity of the ROS indicator. However  N-acetylcysteine as ROS scavengers inhibited ABA-induced apoptosis and autophagy and reversed these ABA-mediated effects on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. On the basis of the above results  it is suggested that ABA exposure induces apoptosis and autophagy in TM3 cells by ROS accumulation to mediate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway suppression.,Autophagy_notLIR
Electroacupuncture Improves Motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and Promotes Neuronal Autophagy Activity in Mouse Brain.Autophagic defects are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders  such as Parkinson's disorder (PD). Enhancing autophagy to remove impaired mitochondria and toxic protein aggregation is an essential component of PD treatment. In particular  activation of autophagy confers neuroprotection in cellular and preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study  we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in mice with established PD and evaluated the relationship between EA  autophagy  and different neurons in the mouse brain. We report that EA improves PD motor symptoms in mice and enhances (1) autophagy initiation (increased Beclin 1)  (2) autophagosome biogenesis (increased Atg5  Atg7  Atg9A  Atg12  Atg16L  Atg3  and LC3-II)  (3) autophagy flux/substrate degradation (decreased p62)  and (4) mitophagy (increased PINK1 and DJ-1) in neurons of the substantia nigra  striatum  hippocampus  and cortex (affected brain areas of PD  Huntington disease  and Alzheimer's disease). EA enhances autophagy initiation  autophagosome biogenesis  mitophagy  and autophagy flux/substrate degradation in certain brain areas. Our findings are the first to show that EA regulates neuronal autophagy and suggest that this convenient  inexpensive treatment has exciting therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders.,Autophagy_notLIR
Using Ubiquitin Binders to Decipher the Ubiquitin Code.Post-translational modifications (PTMs) by ubiquitin (Ub) are versatile  highly dynamic  and involved in nearly all aspects of eukaryote biological function. The reversibility and heterogeneity of Ub chains attached to protein substrates have complicated their isolation  quantification  and characterization. Strategies have emerged to isolate endogenous ubiquitylated targets  including technologies based on the use of Ub-binding peptides  such as tandem-repeated Ub-binding entities (TUBEs). TUBEs allow the identification and characterization of Ub chains  and novel substrates for deubiquitylases (DUBs) and Ub ligases (E3s). Here we review their impact on purification  analysis of pan or chain-selective polyubiquitylated proteins and underline the biological relevance of this information. Together with peptide aptamers and other Ub affinity-based approaches  TUBEs will contribute to unraveling the secrets of the Ub code.,Autophagy_notLIR
Reliable Quantification of pH Variation in Live Cells Using Prussian Blue-Caged Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Probes.Intracellular pH is an important parameter that is highly associated with diverse physiological processes. The reliable measurement of pH values inside cells remains a formidable challenge because of the complexity of cytoplasm. Herein  we report a robust Prussian blue (PB)-caged pH-responsive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe for precisely mapping the dynamic pH values in live cells. The PB shell has a subnanoscale porous structure that allows only very small biospecies such as H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> to pass freely through the shell and react with the encased pH-responsive SERS probe  while physically resisting the entry of large biomolecules. This probe achieved unmatched detection linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.999) for pH measurements in diverse complex biological samples. Moreover  the nitrile (C≡N) in PB shows a sharp band in the cellular Raman-silent region  which serves as a background-free internal standard for accurate profiling of the probe distribution inside the cells. We applied the proposed probe to monitor the dynamic pH changes during cellular autophagy induced by different stimuli and thereby demonstrated that the PB-caged probe can reliably quantify subtle intracellular pH variations  providing an effective tool for revealing the relationship between abnormal intracellular pH and cellular functions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy requires Tip20 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells that responds to environmental changes. Genetic analyses have shown that more than 40 autophagy-related genes (ATG) are directly involved in this process in fungi. In addition to Atg proteins  most vesicle transport regulators are also essential for each step of autophagy. The present study showed that one Endoplasmic Reticulum protein in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>  Tip20  which controls Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport  was also required for starvation-induced autophagy under high temperature stress. In <i>tip20</i> conditional mutant yeast  the transport of Atg8 was impaired during starvation  resulting in multiple Atg8 puncta dispersed outside the vacuole that could not be transported to the pre-autophagosomal structure/phagophore assembly site (PAS). Several Atg8 puncta were trapped in ER exit sites (ERES). Moreover  the GFP-Atg8 protease protection assay indicated that Tip20 functions before autophagosome closure. Furthermore  genetic studies showed that Tip20 functions downstream of Atg5 and upstream of Atg1  Atg9 and Atg14 in the autophagy pathway. The present data show that Tip20  as a vesicle transport regulator  has novel roles in autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cloning and characterization of the target protein subunit lst8 of rapamycin in Apostichopus japonicus.Autophagy plays an important role in the immune defense systems of vertebrates through the interaction between the lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (lst8) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin. In the present study  a novel invertebrate lst8 homologue is identified from Apostichopus japonicus (designated as Ajlst8) via polymerase chain reaction. The full-length complementary DNA of Ajlst8 comprises a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 78 base pair (bp)  a 3'-UTR of 479 bp  and a putative open reading frame of 951 bp; hence  316 amino acids are encoded. Structural analysis shows that the deduced amino acid of Ajlst8 shares six typical WD40 domains (28 aa-248 aa). Spatial expression analysis indicates that Ajlst8 is ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues  with a larger magnitude in coelomocytes. Vibrio splendidus infection in vivo and lipopolysaccharide exposure in vitro can significantly upregulate the messenger RNA expression of Ajlst8 by 2.39-fold and 1.93-fold compared with the control group  respectively. LPS exposure could also significantly induced the protein level of Ajlst8 to 2.38-fold and the autophagy level was markedly increased by 3.08-fold under same condition. The RNA interference of Ajlst8 in primary coelomocytes also reduces the relative expression of autophagy with a 0.71-fold decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I compared with that in the control group. These results indicate that Ajlst8 is a novel immune regulator that may be involved in the antibacterial response process of sea cucumber by regulating autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Decorin is a devouring proteoglycan: Remodeling of intracellular catabolism via autophagy and mitophagy.Autophagy  a fundamental and evolutionarily-conserved eukaryotic pathway  coordinates a complex balancing act for achieving both nutrient and energetic requirements for proper cellular function and homeostasis. We have discovered that soluble proteoglycans evoke autophagy in endothelial cells and mitophagy in breast carcinoma cells by directly interacting with receptor tyrosine kinases  including VEGF receptor 2 and Met. Under these circumstances  autophagic regulation is considered "non-canonical" and is epitomized by the bioactivity of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan  decorin. Soluble matrix-derived cues being transduced downstream of receptor engagement converge upon a newly-discovered nexus of autophagic machinery consisting of Peg3 for endothelial cell autophagy and mitostatin for tumor cell mitophagy. In this thematic mini-review  we will provide an overview of decorin-mediated autophagy and mitophagy and propose that regulating intracellular catabolism is the underlying molecular basis for the versatility of decorin as a potent oncosuppressive agent.,Autophagy_notLIR
Toll-interacting protein impacts on inflammation  autophagy  and vacuole trafficking in human disease.Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) is a ubiquitous intracellular adaptor protein involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways. It plays a key role in mediating inflammatory intracellular responses  promoting autophagy  and enabling vacuole transport within the cell. TOLLIP is being increasingly recognized for its role in disease pathophysiology through involvement in these three primary pathways. Recent research also indicates that TOLLIP is involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic transfer  although this area requires further exploration. TOLLIP is involved in the pathophysiologic pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases  pulmonary diseases  cardiovascular disease  inflammatory bowel disease  and malignancy. We postulate that TOLLIP plays an integral role in the disease pathophysiology of other conditions involved in vacuole trafficking and autophagy. We suggest that future research in this field should investigate the role of TOLLIP in the pathogenesis of these multiple conditions. This research has the potential to inform disease mechanisms and identify novel opportunities for therapeutic advances in multiple disease processes.,Autophagy_notLIR
Molecular evolution of autophagy rate-limiting factor LAMP2 in placental mammals.Autophagy is the cellular process of removal of misfolded or damaged macromolecules and organelles. Experimental studies have demonstrated autophagy as a major mechanism of lifespan extension in long-lived mammals such as bats and mole rat rodents. Moreover  the role of this biological process has been well documented in protection against age-associated diseases and viral infection. However  studies on the molecular adaptive changes of autophagy factors during evolution are scarce. Here  we conducted a bioinformatics study of the molecular evolution of the Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 2 (LAMP2)  as a rate-limiting factor in the lysosomal degradation stage of autophagy (the communal step of two of autophagy types: macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated). Analyzing LAMP2 across placental mammals  our phylogenetic-based maximum likelihood analyses indicate that the majority of the coding sites undergo purifying selection. However  around 27% of sites display a relaxation of purifying constraints (average ω = 0.42128)  among which  14 particular sites undergo positive selection (ω > 1). These sites are mostly located in the first luminal domain of LAMP2 (N-domain)  with a hotspot region in the 135-144 codons interval. Therefore  the N-domain may account for the functional diversity and regulation of LAMP2. In addition  the identified positive selection sites could act as key regulatory sites in the LAMP2 function. On the other hand  testing the rate of evolution in LAMP2 along different clades of placental mammals revealed a relatively relaxed evolution in LAMP2 along megabats' clade. It is not clear yet whether an expedited evolution of LAMP2 in megabats has contributed to their reported up-regulation of autophagy. Finally  our data indicate positive selection sites along the ancestral branch of the clades of rodents  mouse-related rodents  and mole-rats; and suggest the potentially important regulatory role of these sites in LAMP2. Identifying the residues under positive selection  our findings pave the way for future experimental investigations to define how these selective substitutions have functionally affected autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Putting out the Fire of Inflammation.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine  comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Among the complicated pathogenic factors of IBD  the overaction of inflammatory and immune reaction serves as an important factor. Inflammasome is a form of innate immunity as well as inflammation. Among all kinds of inflammasomes  the NOD-like receptor family  pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the most studied one  and has been revealed to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD. Here  in this review  the association between the NLRP3 inflammasome and IBD will be discussed. Furthermore  several NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors which have been demonstrated to be effective in the alleviation of IBD will be described in this review.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Binding of PD-L1 and Akt Facilitates Glioma Cell Invasion Upon Starvation via Akt/Autophagy/F-Actin Signaling.Glioma  especially glioblastoma  is pathologically characterized by high aggressiveness  which largely contributed to the ineffectiveness of current therapies. It has been recently reported that intrinsic PD-L1 can regulate tumor malignancy  whereas underlying mechanisms remain mostly unclear. Here  we report a novel mechanism by which PD-L1 promotes glioma cell infiltration. In orthotopic glioma models  PD-L1 expression was up-regulated predominantly in glioma cells in the infiltrating front. For PD-L1-overexpressed glioma cells  PI3K/Akt and actin regulations were among the top six most altered signaling pathways as detected by RNA-sequencing. PD-L1 significantly activated Akt/F-actin signaling while suppressed autophagic signaling upon cell starvation. Mechanistically  PD-L1 preferentially bound to Akt among various PI3K/Akt signaling proteins. Serial truncation identified the interaction between the 128-237aa fragment of PD-L1 and the 112-480aa fragment of Akt  which facilitates the membrane translocation/activation of Akt  and was unaffected by Perifosin (specific p-Akt inhibitor targeting Akt PH-domain). Taken together  our data indicate that in glioma cells  PD-L1 is induced to prevent autophagic cytoskeleton collapse via Akt binding/activation  facilitating glioma cell invasion upon starvation stress.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mito-Tempo suppresses autophagic flux via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.The generation of excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is associated with glutamate-stimulated neurotoxicity and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impaired mitochondrial function is accompanied with oxidative stress that is a significant contributor to initiate autophagy  but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Mito-Tempo on glutamate-induced neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell toxicity. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 100 μM glutamate in the presence or absence of 50 and 100 μM Mito-Tempo for 24 h. Changes in cell viability were measured by MTT assay. Cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS accumulation were also evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay and 2 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) Reactive Oxygen Species Assay kit  respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by tetraethylbenzimidazoly-lcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining. Expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and autophagy markers  including LC3 (LC3-I/-II) and p62 (SQSTM1) were performed using Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that glutamate-exposed cells significantly increased cellular oxidative stress by enhancing ROS production. Glutamate treatment also increased LDH release follows the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential  caused cell viability loss. Treatment with Mito-Tempo not only attenuated the generation of ROS and improved mitochondrial membrane potential but also reduced the neurotoxicity of glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner  which leads to increased cell viability and decreased LDH release. Mito-Tempo has a greater protective effect by enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and PI3K/AKT/mTOR phosphorylation. Moreover  Mito-Tempo treatment altered the autophagy process resulting in the decline in the ratio of the autophagy markers LC3-I/-II and p62 (SQSTM1). We propose that Mito-Tempo can improve neuronal properties against glutamate cytotoxicity through its direct free radical scavenging activity and inhibit excessive autophagy signaling pathway  therefore  allow for further studies to investigate the therapeutic potentials of Mito-Tempo in animal disease models and human.,Autophagy_notLIR
Disulfiram/copper shows potent cytotoxic effects on myelodysplastic syndromes via inducing Bip-mediated apoptosis and suppressing autophagy.Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who resist or fail to respond to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) show very poor outcomes and have no effective treatment strategies. Therefore  new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed for MDS patients harboring adverse prognostic factors. Repurposing disulfiram (DSF)  an alcohol-abuse drug  with or without Copper (Cu) has attracted considerable attentions as a candidate anti-tumor therapy in diverse malignancies. However  the effect of DSF in the presence or absence of Cu on MDS has not been reported yet. In this study  we found that monotherapy with DSF showed mild cytotoxic effects on MDS preclinical models. However  the anti-tumor activity of DSF was significantly enhanced in the presence of Cu in MDS in vitro and in vivo with minimal safety profiles. DSF/Cu combination blocked MDS cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase  accompanied by reduction of the S phase. Accordingly  co-treatment with DSF and Cu downregulated the expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A2  whereas this combination upregulated the level of P21 and P27. Mechanistically  the anti-MDS effectiveness of DSF/Cu was potentially associated with activation of the ER stress-related Bip pathway and inactivation of the Akt pathway. In addition  inhibition of autophagy process also contributed to the cytotoxicity of DSF/Cu in MDS cells. In conclusion  these findings provide impressive evidence that the DSF/Cu complex shows potent anti-tumor efficacies on MDS preclinical models  representing a potential alternative therapy for MDS patients and warranting further investigation in clinical contexts.,Autophagy_notLIR
Unraveling the Big Sleep: Molecular Aspects of Stem Cell Dormancy and Hibernation.Tissue-resident stem cells may enter a dormant state  also known as quiescence  which allows them to withstand metabolic stress and unfavorable conditions. Similarly  hibernating mammals can also enter a state of dormancy used to evade hostile circumstances  such as food shortage and low ambient temperatures. In hibernation  the dormant state of the individual and its cells is commonly known as torpor  and is characterized by metabolic suppression in individual cells. Given that both conditions represent cell survival strategies  we here compare the molecular aspects of cellular quiescence  particularly of well-studied hematopoietic stem cells  and torpor at the cellular level. Critical processes of dormancy are reviewed  including the suppression of the cell cycle  changes in metabolic characteristics  and cellular mechanisms of dealing with damage. Key factors shared by hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and torpor include a reversible activation of factors inhibiting the cell cycle  a shift in metabolism from glucose to fatty acid oxidation  downregulation of mitochondrial activity  key changes in hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha (HIF-1α)  mTOR  reversible protein phosphorylation and autophagy  and increased radiation resistance. This similarity is remarkable in view of the difference in cell populations  as stem cell quiescence regards proliferating cells  while torpor mainly involves terminally differentiated cells. A future perspective is provided how to advance our understanding of the crucial pathways that allow stem cells and hibernating animals to engage in their 'great slumbers.',Autophagy_notLIR

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment prevents doxorubicin-induced myocardial dysfunction in vivo.Improvements in cancer treatment have significantly extended the lifespan of patients. However  due to the adverse effects of cancer treatment  cancer survivors are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Doxorubicin is a widely used spectrum antitumor drug  but the life-threatening side-effect of cardiotoxicity limits its clinical application. Ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)  as a heteropolar compound with pH value regulation  can cause intracellular alkalization and metabolic acidosis thus effecting enzymatic activity and influencing the process of biological system. The underlying effect of NH<sub>4</sub>CL in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy in mice has never been reported before.,Autophagy_notLIR
Altering microtubule stability affects microtubule clearance and nuclear extrusion during erythropoiesis.Mammalian erythrocytes are highly specialized cells that have adapted to lose their nuclei and cellular components during maturation to ensure oxygen delivery. Nuclear extrusion  the most critical event during erythropoiesis  represents an extreme case of asymmetric partitioning that requires a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. However  the precise role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the enucleation process remains controversial. In this study  we show that microtubule reorganization is critical for microtubule clearance and nuclear extrusion during erythropoiesis. Using a rodent anemia model  we found that microtubules were present in erythroblasts and reticulocytes but were undetectable in erythrocytes. Further analysis demonstrated that microtubules became disordered in reticulocytes and revealed that microtubule stabilization was critical for tubulin degradation. Disruption of microtubule dynamics using the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel or the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole did not affect the efficiency of erythroblast enucleation. However  paclitaxel treatment resulted in the retention of tubulin in mature erythrocytes  and nocodazole treatment led to a defect in pyrenocyte morphology. Taken together  our data reveals a critical role for microtubules in erythrocyte development. Our findings also implicate the disruption of microtubule dynamics in the pathogenesis of anemia-associated diseases  providing new insight into the pathogenesis of the microtubule-targeted agent-associated anemia frequently observed during cancer chemotherapy.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist Montelukast Reduces Alpha-Synuclein Load and Restores Memory in an Animal Model of Dementia with Lewy Bodies.Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represents a huge medical need as it accounts for up to 30% of all dementia cases  and there is no cure available. The underyling spectrum of pathology is complex and creates a challenge for targeted molecular therapies. We here tested the hypothesis that leukotrienes are involved in the pathology of DLB and that blocking leukotrienes through Montelukast  a leukotriene receptor antagonist and approved anti-asthmatic drug  might alleviate pathology and restore cognitive functions. Expression of 5-lipoxygenase  the rate-limiting enzyme for leukotriene production  was indeed elevated in brains with DLB. Treatment of cognitively deficient human alpha-synuclein overexpressing transgenic mice with Montelukast restored memory. Montelukast treatment resulted in modulation of beclin-1 expression  a marker for autophagy  and in a reduction in the human alpha-synulcein load in the transgenic mice. Reducing the protein aggregation load in neurodegenerative diseases might be a novel model of action of Montelukast. Moreover  this work presents leukotriene signaling as a potential drug target for DLB and shows that Montelukast might be a promising drug candidate for future DLB therapy development.,Autophagy_notLIR
Oncogenic BRAF  endoplasmic reticulum stress  and autophagy: Crosstalk and therapeutic targets in cutaneous melanoma.BRAF is a member of the RAF family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Oncogenic BRAF  in particular  BRAF V600E  can disturb the normal protein folding machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER lumen  a condition known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To alleviate such conditions  ER-stressed cells have developed a highly robust and adaptable signaling network known as unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is ordinarily a cytoprotective response and usually operates through the induction of autophagy  an intracellular lysosomal degradation pathway that directs damaged proteins  protein aggregates  and damaged organelles for bulk degradation and recycling. Both ER stress and autophagy are involved in the progression and chemoresistance of melanoma. Melanoma  which arises as a result of malignant transformation of melanocytes  exhibits exceptionally high therapeutic resistance. Many mechanisms of therapeutic resistance have been identified in individual melanoma patients and in preclinical BRAF-driven melanoma models. Recently  it has been recognized that oncogenic BRAF interacts with GRP78 and removes its inhibitory influence on the three fundamental ER stress sensors of UPR  PERK  IRE1α  and ATF6. Dissociation of GRP78 from these ER stress sensors prompts UPR that subsequently activates cytoprotective autophagy. Thus  pharmacological inhibition of BRAF-induced ER stress-mediated autophagy can potentially resensitize BRAF mutant melanoma tumors to apoptosis. However  the underlying molecular mechanism of how oncogenic BRAF elevates the basal level of ER stress-mediated autophagy in melanoma tumors is not well characterized. A better understanding of the crosstalk between oncogenic BRAF  ER stress and autophagy may provide a rationale for improving existing cancer therapies and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention of melanoma.,Autophagy_notLIR

Nanomaterials for Autophagy-Related miRNA-34a Delivery in Cancer Treatment.Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved physiological process with a fundamental role during development  differentiation  and survival of eukaryotic cells. On the other hand  autophagy dysregulation is observed in many pathological conditions  including cancer. In particular  tumor growth and progression are accompanied and promoted by increased autophagy that allows cancer cells to escape apoptosis and to proliferate also in harsh microenvironments. It is  therefore  clear that the impairment of the autophagic process may represent a valid strategy to inhibit or reduce cancer growth and progression. Among the plethora of molecular players controlling cancer growth  a group of small endogenous noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) has recently emerged. In fact  miRNAs can act as either oncogenes or oncosuppressors depending on their target genes. Moreover  among miRNAs  miRNA-34a has been connected with both tumor repression and autophagy regulation  and its expression is frequently lost in many cancers. Therefore  enforced expression of miRNA-34a in cancer cells may represent a valid strategy to reduce cancer growth. However  such strategy is limited by the fast biodegradation and short half-life of miRNA-34a and by the lack of an efficient intracellular delivery system. The following review describes the autophagic process and its role in cancer as well as the role of miRNAs in general and miRNA-34a in particular in regulating tumor growth by modulating autophagy. Finally  we describe the use of nanoparticles as a promising strategy to selectively deliver miRNA-34a to tumor cells for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.,Autophagy_notLIR
IFN-DC Loaded with Autophagosomes containing Virus Antigen is Highly Efficient in Inducing Virus-Specific Human T Cells.Autophagy plays a critical role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumors. A previous study utilized proteasome and lysosome inhibitors to form autophagosomes (DRibbles) and the effect of dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with DRibbles in activating antigen-specific T cells has been demonstrated in a mouse experiment and human IL-4-DC. In this study  CMV-DRibbles derived from MDA cell lines expressing cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 protein were loaded onto human IFN-DC and IL-4-DC derived from monocytes  respectively. We observed that CMV-DRibbles resulted in the up-regulation of HLA-DR  CD11c  and CD83  but not co-stimulatory molecules CD 80 and CD86 on IFN-DC. Meanwhile  the expression of HLA-DR  CD80  CD83  and CD86  except for CD11c on IL-4-DC loaded with CMV-DRibbles were up-regulated. Moreover  CMV-DRibbles had no ability to stimulate these two moDCs to secrete cytokines IL-6  IL-1β and IL-10. Then  we optimized the conditions for antigen up-take by DCs and found that mature moDCs had a superior ability to up-take CMV-DRibbles compared with immature DCs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore  the efficiency of CMV-DRibbles up-take by IFN-DC was superior compared to IL-4-DC. Finally  we observed that mIFN-DC was significantly more efficient at stimulating autologous CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (0.39 vs. 0.28 %  <i>p</i><0.05) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (0.36 vs. 0.12%  <i>p</i><0.05) to secrete IFN-γ compared with mIL-4-DC. Therefore  DRibbles containing specific viral antigens were efficient activators of human antigen-specific T cells. Our results demonstrated that IFN-DC loaded with CMV-DRibbles revealed a superior ability to induce CMV-specific T cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
lncRNA involved in triptonide-induced cytotoxicity in mouse germ cells.Triptonide reportedly has strong antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities. However  its severe toxicity  including to the reproductive system  has greatly restricted its use in patients who wish to preserve fertility. lncRNAs play crucial roles in male fertility and reportedly regulate triptonide's antitumor activity. However  whether lncRNAs are involved in triptonide-induced reproductive toxicity is unknown. Here  we showed that triptonide induced significant cytotoxicity  as demonstrated by reduced cell viability and induction of apoptosis and autophagy in mouse germ cells (a spermatocyte cell line  GC2). The expression levels of numerous lncRNAs and mRNAs in GC2 cells were altered at the transcriptome level after treatment with triptonide for 24 h  as determined by RNA sequencing. Gene ontology and pathway analyses showed that the functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were closely linked with many processes  including gene expression regulation  cell death  cell cycle regulation  cell proliferation and development and others. After validating our RNA-seq data  we selected one lncRNA  Obox4-ps35  dramatically induced by triptonide for further investigation. Obox4-ps35 knock-out aggravated triptonide-induced cytotoxicity by decreasing cell survival and increasing apoptosis and autophagy rates. These data suggest that germ cells exposed to triptonide overexpress Obox4-ps35 to protect against triptonide-induced cytotoxicity. This study provides preliminary evidence and novel directions for exploring roles of lncRNAs in triptonide-induced cytotoxicity  especially in reproductive toxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
The Role of Autophagy and Mitophagy in Bone Metabolic Disorders.Bone metabolic disorders include osteolysis  osteoporosis  osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are two major types of cells in bone constituting homeostasis. The imbalance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts has been shown to have a direct contribution to the onset of these diseases. Recent evidence indicates that autophagy and mitophagy  the selective autophagy of mitochondria  may play a vital role in regulating the proliferation  differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Several signaling pathways  including PINK1/Parkin  SIRT1  MAPK8/FOXO3  Beclin-1/BECN1  p62/SQSTM1  and mTOR pathways  have been implied in the regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in these cells. Here we review the current progress about the regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in osteoblasts and osteoclasts in these bone metabolic disorders  as well as the molecular signaling activated or deactivated during this process. Together  we hope to draw attention to the role of autophagy and mitophagy in bone metabolic disorders  and their potential as a new target for the treatment of bone metabolic diseases and the requirements of further mechanism studies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Involvement of autophagy in realgar quantum dots (RQDs) inhibition of human endometrial cancer JEC cells.Realgar (As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) has been used in traditional Chinese medicines for treatment of malignancies. The poor solubility of As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> hampered its clinical applications. Realgar quantum dots (RQDs) were developed to overcome these problems. Previous studies revealed that the RQDs were effective against endometrial cancer JEC cells and hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells via inducing apoptosis.Apoptosis and autophagy are important programmed cell death pathways leading to anticancer effects. This study further examined effects of RQDs on autophagy  focusing on the formation of the autophagosome in JEC cells. CCK8 assay was used to examine cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine the autophagy  cells were transfected with pEGFP-C3-MAP1LC3B plasmid to examine effects of RQDs on autophagosome via confocal microscope. Autophagy-related proteins were examined by Western blot. RQDs exhibited cytotoxicity in JEC cells in a concentration- and time- dependent manner. RQDs induced G2 and S phase arrest in JEC cells. RQDs significantly induced autophagy  with the double-membrane and autophagosome-like structures by TEM. The diffused distribution of pEGFP-C3-MAP1LC3B green fluorescence were become the punctuate pattern fluorescence after treatment with RQDs in cells transfected with pEGFP-C3-MAP1LC3B plasmid RQDs increased the expression of autophagyregulatory proteins LC3 I/II  Beclin-1  p62 and Atg12 in a concentration-dependent manner  similar to autophagy induced by serum starvation  except for p62  as induction of p62 is a characteristic of arsenic compounds. Taken together  the present study clearly demonstrated that RQDs can induce autophagy in JEC cells as one of mechanisms of anticancer effects  and indicated that RQDs may be developed as an autophagy inducer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Reduction of Aging-Induced Oxidative Stress and Activation of Autophagy by Bilberry Anthocyanin Supplementation via the AMPK-mTOR Signaling Pathway in Aged Female Rats.Oxidative-stress-induced senescence constitutes a great risk factor for chronic diseases. Therefore  ameliorating oxidative-stress-induced senescence is expected to prevent chronic diseases. The beneficial effects of bilberry anthocyanin (BA) on healthy aging were evaluated using 12 month old  aging female SD rats in this study. The experimental results suggested that consumption of a middle-dose of BA (MBA) appreciably increased the relative liver mass by 7.34% when compared with that of the AC group. Furthermore  BA significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity  total superoxide dismutase activity  and catalase activities; decreased malondialdehyde  serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  serum total cholesterol (TC)  serum triglyceride (TG)  and glycated serum protein (GSP) levels; and reduced TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios. In addition  MBA decreased the activity of fecal bacterial enzymes and increased the content of fecal short-chain fatty acids. The Western blot results showed that MBA significantly upregulated the expression of OCLN  ZO-1  and autophagy-related proteins (ATP6 V0C  ATG4D  and CTSB) in aging rats. Moreover  it also showed that MBA induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and FOXO3a and inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR  which indicated that bilberry anthocyanin induced autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways. This induction of autophagy further promoted oxidative stress resistance effects and intestinal epithelial barrier function of bilberry anthocyanin in aging female rats.,Autophagy_notLIR

PM<sub>2.5</sub>  Fine Particulate Matter: A Novel Player in the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition?Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) refers to the conversion of epithelial cells to mesenchymal phenotype  which endows the epithelial cells with enhanced migration  invasion  and extracellular matrix production abilities. These characteristics link EMT with the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis and cancer progression. Recent studies have preliminarily established that fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is correlated with EMT initiation. In this pathological process  PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles  excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from PM<sub>2.5</sub>  and certain components in PM<sub>2.5</sub>  such as ions and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  have been implicated as potential EMT mediators that are linked to the activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/SMADs  NF-κB  growth factor (GF)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)  GF/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt  wingless/integrated (Wnt)/β-catenin  Notch  Hedgehog  high mobility group box B1 (HMGB1)-receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE)  and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling cascades and to cytoskeleton rearrangement. These pathways directly and indirectly transduce pro-EMT signals that regulate EMT-related gene expression in epithelial cells  finally inducing the characteristic alterations in morphology and functions of epithelia. In addition  novel associations between autophagy  ATP citrate lyase (ACLY)  and exosomes with PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced EMT have also been summarized. However  some debates and paradoxes remain to be consolidated. This review discusses the potential molecular mechanisms underlying PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced EMT  which might account for the latent role of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in cancer progression and fibrogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
PM2.5 induces autophagy and apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress in human endothelial cells.Endothelial cells integrally form a crucial interface that maintains homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. As a vulnerable target of PM2.5  the underlying mechanisms of endothelial cell damage have yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study  two types of cell death  including autophagy and apoptosis  and an important organelle of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were focalized following PM2.5 exposure. As a result  the internalization of PM2.5 has the ability to induce excess ER stress  which is a crucial step for further autophagy and apoptosis in human endothelial cells  as confirmed by the pre-treatment with the inhibitor of ER stress (4-PBA) which effectively mitigates the apoptosis rate and LC3II expression. Intriguingly  crosstalk between ER stress and autophagy demonstrated that ER stress is probably involved in autophagic events  whereas autophagy has no significant effect on ER stress but confer a protective role against PM2.5-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Moreover  PM2.5 results in blockage of autophagic flux (failed fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes)  which is detrimental to endothelial cell survival. In conclusion  our findings provide a valuable insight into the relation between autophagy and apoptosis under PM2.5-induced ER stress conditions  where the interplay between them ultimately determines cell fate.,Autophagy_notLIR
Integrative analysis reveals key mRNAs and lncRNAs in monocytes of osteoporotic patients.Osteoporosis is the most common bone metabolic disease. Abnormal osteoclast formation and resorption play a fundamental role in osteoporosis pathogenesis. Recent researches have greatly broaden our understanding of molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis. However  the molecular mechanisms of key mRNAs and lncRNAs  and their interactions leading to osteoporosis are still not entirely clear. The purpose of this work is to study the key mRNAs and lncRNAs  and their interactions involved in bone mineral homeostasis and osteoclastogenesis. Systematic analyses such as differential expression analysis  GO and KEGG analysis  and PPI network construction revealed that up-regulated mRNAs were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways. Moreover  we observed that the down-regulated proteins  including JDP2  HADC4  HDAC5  CDYL2  ACADVL  ACSL1 and BRD4  were key components in the down-regulated PPI network  indicating that the downregulation of histone deacetylases and cofactors  such as  HDAC4  HDAC5 and JDP2 may be critical regulators in osteoclastogenesis. In addition  we also highlighted one lncRNA  RP11-498C9.17  was highly correlated with epigenetic regulators  such as HDAC4  MORF4L1  HMGA1 and DND1  indicating that the lncRNA RP11-498C9.17 may also be an epigenetic regulator. In conclusion  our integrative analysis reveals key mRNAs and lncRNAs  involved in bone mineral homeostasis and osteoclastogenesis  which not only broaden our insights into lncRNAs in bone mineral homeostasis and osteoclastogenesis  but also improve our understanding of molecular mechanism.,Autophagy_notLIR
Differential effects of N-acetylcysteine on retinal degeneration in two mouse models of normal tension glaucoma.N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is widely used as a mucolytic agent and as an antidote to paracetamol overdose. NAC serves as a precursor of cysteine and stimulates the synthesis of glutathione in neural cells. Suppressing oxidative stress in the retina may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glaucoma  a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerves. Here we examined the therapeutic potential of NAC in two mouse models of normal tension glaucoma  in which excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) or glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) gene was deleted. EAAC1 is expressed in retinal neurons including RGCs  whereas GLAST is mainly expressed in Müller glial cells. Intraperitoneal administration of NAC prevented RGC degeneration and visual impairment in EAAC1-deficient (knockout; KO) mice  but not in GLAST KO mice. In EAAC1 KO mice  oxidative stress and autophagy were suppressed with increased glutathione levels by NAC treatment. Our findings suggest a possibility that systemic administration of NAC may be available for some types of glaucoma patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Long noncoding RNA HAGLROS promotes cell proliferation  inhibits apoptosis and enhances autophagy via regulating miR-5095/ATG12 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.In this research  we planned to dig the possible influences and mechanism of long noncoding (lnc) RNA HAGLROS in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of lncRNA HAGLROS in HCC tumor samples and their relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC were studied. Subsequently  overexpression and silenced approaches were used in HCC cells for detecting the effects of lncRNA HAGLROS on cell viability  apoptosis  and autophagy. Furthermore  we investigated whether HAGLROS could function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-5095 expression in HCC cells  and explored the correlation between miR-5095 and ATG12. Besides  the correlation of HAGLROS  the consequent PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was further explored. The level of HAGLROS was higher in HCC tissues and correlated with clinical performances including tumor stages or tumor differentiation. In contrast to the lower level  a higher level of HAGLROS correlated with a shorter survival time of patients with HCC. The suppression of HAGLROS decreased cell viability  promoted apoptosis  and inhibited autophagy. Moreover  HAGLROS negatively regulated miR-5095 expression  which further regulated HCC cell viability  apoptosis  and autophagy. In addition  ATG12 was targeted by miR-5095 and was then involved in miR-5095-regulated HCC cell biological processes including viability  apoptosis  and autophagy. Furthermore  overexpression of HAGLROS activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals. Our results revealed that HAGLROS is highly expressed in HCC  and its high level may correlate with the progression and development of HCC involving the processes of cell viability  apoptosis  and autophagy through the miR-5095/ATG12 axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals.,Autophagy_notLIR
The protective effect of natural compounds against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity.Rotenone is a widely used organic pesticide; its serious side effect for off-target species is neurotoxicity. The primary mechanism of rotenone toxicity is inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I. Oxidative stress  apoptosis  and reduction of autophagy are key outcomes of the inhibition of complex I. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown antioxidant  anti-apoptotic  and autophagy enhancement of a variety of natural compounds (NCs). In this manuscript  we reviewed several NCs  which have protective effects against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR

Anhydroecgonine methyl ester  a cocaine pyrolysis product  contributes to cocaine-induced rat primary hippocampal neuronal death in a synergistic and time-dependent manner.Crack cocaine users are simultaneously exposed to volatilized cocaine and to its main pyrolysis product  anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME). Although the neurotoxic effects of cocaine have been extensively studied  little is known about AEME or its combination. We investigated cell death processes using rat primary hippocampal cells exposed to cocaine (2 mM)  AEME (1 mM) and their combination (C + A)  after 1  3  6 and 12 h. Cocaine increased LC3 I after 6 h and LC3 II after 12 h  but reduced the percentage of cells with acid vesicles  suggesting failure in the autophagic flux  which activated the extrinsic apoptotic pathway after 12 h. AEME neurotoxicity did not involve the autophagic process; rather  it activated caspase-9 after 6 h and caspase-8 after 12 h leading to a high percentage of cells in early apoptosis. C + A progressively reduced the percentage of undamaged cells  starting after 3 h; it activated both apoptotic pathways after 6 h  and was more neurotoxic than cocaine and AEME alone. Also  C + A increased the phosphorylation of p62 after 12 h  but there was little difference in LC3 I or II  and a small percentage of cells with acid vesicles at all time points investigated. In summary  the present study provides new evidence for the neurotoxic mechanism and timing response of each substance alone and in combination  indicating that AEME is more than just a biological marker for crack cocaine consumption  as it may intensify and hasten cocaine neurotoxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Down-regulation of protease-activated receptor 2 ameliorated osteoarthritis in rats through regulation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.Recently  protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) has been proved to be involved in the inflammatory response including osteoarthritis (OA). In the present study  we found that PAR2 antagonist could remarkably improve the pathological condition of OA rats in vivo. In addition  we also found that PAR2 antagonist could suppress the production of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and Cox-2)  decrease the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13  and restrain the levels of P62 proteins and aggravate the expression of LC3-II both in vivo and in vitro. Besides  in vitro  PAR2 antagonist could increase the proliferation and colony formation of chondrocytes induced with IL-1β. Moreover  PAR2 antagonist could decrease the expression of expressions of p-p38  p-IκBα and p-NF-κB in vitro. However  PAR2 agonist exhibited the opposite effects. Furthermore  SB203580  a p38 MAPK inhibitor  could remarkably promote the proliferation of chondrocytes induced with IL-1β  could alleviate the production of TNF-α and Cox-2  could down-regulate the protein expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13  and could decrease the expression of P62 and increase the expressions of LC3-II of chondrocytes induced with IL-1β. Importantly  SB203580 could reverse the effects of PAR2 agonist on the functions of chondrocytes induced with IL-1β. Taken together  the present data suggest that down-regulation of PAR2 can ameliorate OA through inducing autophagy via regulation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro  and PAR2 can be considered as a potential candidate to treat OA.,Autophagy_notLIR
In vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of syringic acid on colorectal cancer: Possible mechanistic view.This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effects of syringic acid on human colorectal cancer cells (SW-480) and the effect of orally administered syringic acid on in vivo models of colorectal cancer induced in rats by administration of 1 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). In vitro effects of syringic acid treatment on human colorectal cancer SW-480 cell lines were assessed by performing cell proliferation assay (MTT and Trypan Blue staining)  apoptosis assays (TUNEL assay  Annexin-V/PI flowcytometry and lactate dehydrogenase release assay)  measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS)  antioxidant enzymes and DNA damage  and evaluating protein levels of proliferative genes  and autophagy markers. In vitro anti-cancer roles of syringic acid were studied in rats with DMH-induced colorectal cancer cells. The effect of orally administered syringic acid (50 mg/kg) on tumor growth and incidence was studied in four groups (n = 6) of animals injected with DMH and treated for 15 weeks. Syringic acid treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation  induction of apoptosis through increasing cellular ROS and DNA damage levels  as well as downregulating major proliferative genes. In vivo  treatment of rats with syringic acid demonstrated a statistically significant tumor volume and incidence reduction when compared to the control. This is the first study demonstrating an in vivo growth inhibitory effect of orally administered syringic acid on colorectal tumors in rats.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine restricts murine cytomegalovirus replication.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) induced autophagy affects virus replication and survival of the infected cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) on murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) replication and whether it is associated with caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. The eyecup isolated from adult C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks old) and mouse embryo fibroblast cells (MEFs) were infected with MCMV K181 strain  followed by the treatment of 3-methyladenine (3-MA)  chloroquine  or rapamycin to block or stimulate autophagy. In cultured MEFs  the ratio of LC3I/II was reduced at 24 hours post infection (hpi)  but was increased at 48 hpi In the eyecup culture  LC3I/II ratio was also decreased at 4 and 7 days post infection (dpi). In addition  caspase-3 cleavage was increased at 48 hpi in MEFs and also elevated in MCMV infected eyecups at 4  7  10  and 14 dpi. 3-MA treatment significantly inhibited the virus replication in MEFs and eyecups. The expression of early antigen (EA) of MCMV was also decreased in MEFs and eyecups. Meanwhile  cleaved caspase-3 dependent cell death was promoted with the presence of 3-MA in MCMV infected MEFs and eyecups  while RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway was inhibited by 3-MA in eyecups. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA restricts virus replication and promotes caspase-3 dependent apoptosis in the eyecup and MEFs with MCMV infection. It can be explained that during the early period of MCMV infection  the suppressed autophagy process directly reduced virus release  but later caspase-3 dependent apoptosis dominated and resulted in decreased virus replication.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy Is Required for Maturation of Surfactant-Containing Lamellar Bodies in the Lung and Swim Bladder.Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system  but its physiological functions in vertebrates are not yet fully understood. Here  we show that autophagy is required for inflation of air-filled organs: zebrafish swim bladder and mouse lung. In wild-type zebrafish swim bladder and mouse lung type II pulmonary epithelial cells  autophagosomes are formed and frequently fuse with lamellar bodies. The lamellar body is a lysosome-related organelle that stores a phospholipid-containing surfactant complex that lines the air-liquid interface and reduces surface tension. We find that autophagy is critical for maturation of the lamellar body. Accordingly  atg-deficient zebrafish fail to maintain their position in the water  and type-II-pneumocyte-specific Fip200-deficient mice show neonatal lethality with respiratory failure. Autophagy suppression does not affect synthesis of the surfactant phospholipid  suggesting that autophagy supplies lipids and membranes to lamellar bodies. These results demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role of autophagy in lamellar body maturation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Programmed cell death in alcohol-associated liver disease.Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)  which ranges from mild disease to alcohol-associated hepatitis and cirrhosis  is the most prevalent type of chronic liver disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accumulating evidence reveals that programmed cell death (PCD) plays a crucial role in progression of ALD involving crosstalk between hepatocytes and immune cells. Multiple pathways of PCD  including apoptosis  necroptosis  autophagy  pyroptosis and ferroptosis  are reported in ALD. Interestingly  PCD pathways are intimately linked and interdependent  making it difficult to therapeutically target a single pathway. This review clarifies the multiple types of PCD occurring in liver and focuses on crosstalk between hepatocytes and innate immune cells in ALD.,Autophagy_notLIR
Apoptosis  Autophagy  and Pyroptosis: Immune Escape Strategies for Persistent Infection and Pathogenesis of Classical Swine Fever Virus.Classical swine fever (CSF) is a severe acute infectious disease that results from classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection  which leads to serious economic losses in the porcine industry worldwide. In recent years  numerous studies related to the immune escape mechanism of the persistent infection and pathogenesis of CSFV have been performed. Remarkably  several independent groups have reported that apoptosis  autophagy  and pyroptosis play a significant role in the occurrence and development of CSF  as well as in the immunological process. Apoptosis  autophagy  and pyroptosis are the fundamental biological processes that maintain normal homeostatic and metabolic function in eukaryotic organisms. In general  these three cellular biological processes are always understood as an immune defense response initiated by the organism after perceiving a pathogen infection. Nevertheless  several viruses  including CSFV and other common pathogens such as hepatitis C and influenza A  have evolved strategies for infection and replication using these three cellular biological process mechanisms. In this review  we summarize the known roles of apoptosis  autophagy  and pyroptosis in CSFV infection and how viruses manipulate these three cellular biological processes to evade the immune response.,Autophagy_notLIR
Genomic Characterization and Expressional Profiles of Autophagy-Related Genes (<i>ATGs</i>) in Oilseed Crop Castor Bean (<i>Ricinus communis L.</i>).Cellular autophagy is a widely-occurring conserved process for turning over damaged organelles or recycling cytoplasmic contents in cells. Although autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) have been broadly identified from many plants  little is known about the potential function of autophagy in mediating plant growth and development  particularly in recycling cytoplasmic contents during seed development and germination. Castor bean (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) is one of the most important inedible oilseed crops. Its mature seed has a persistent and large endosperm with a hard and lignified seed coat  and is considered a model system for studying seed biology. Here  a total of 34 <i>RcATG</i> genes were identified in the castor bean genome and their sequence structures were characterized. The expressional profiles of these <i>RcATGs</i> were examined using RNA-seq and real-time PCR in a variety of tissues. In particular  we found that most <i>RcATGs</i> were significantly up-regulated in the later stage of seed coat development  tightly associated with the lignification of cell wall tissues. During seed germination  the expression patterns of most <i>RcATGs</i> were associated with the decomposition of storage oils. Furthermore  we observed by electron microscopy that the lipid droplets were directly swallowed by the vacuoles  suggesting that autophagy directly participates in mediating the decomposition of lipid droplets via the microlipophagy pathway in germinating castor bean seeds. This study provides novel insights into understanding the potential function of autophagy in mediating seed development and germination.,Autophagy_notLIR
Capsaicin Targets Lipogenesis in HepG2 Cells Through AMPK Activation  AKT Inhibition and PPARs Regulation.Obesity  a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D)  represents a serious primary health problem worldwide. Dietary habits are of special interest to prevent and counteract the obesity and its associated metabolic disorders  including lipid steatosis. Capsaicin  a pungent compound of chili peppers  has been found to ameliorate diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of capsaicin on hepatic lipogenesis and to delineate the underlying signaling pathways involved  using HepG2 cells as an experimental model. Cellular neutral lipids  stained with BODIPY493/503  were quantified by flow cytometry  and the protein expression and activity were determined by immunoblotting. Capsaicin reduced basal neutral lipid content in HepG2 cells  as well that induced by troglitazone or by oleic acid. This effect of capsaicin was prevented by dorsomorphin and GW9662  pharmacological inhibitors of AMPK and PPARγ  respectively. In addition  capsaicin activated AMPK and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway  major regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore  capsaicin blocked autophagy and increased PGC-1α protein. These results suggest that capsaicin behaves as an anti-lipogenic compound in HepG2 cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
DUSP5 (dual-specificity protein phosphatase 5) suppresses BCG-induced autophagy via ERK 1/2 signaling pathway.Autophagy is considered as an effective strategy for host cells to eliminate intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5) is an endogenous phosphatase of ERK1/2  and plays an important role in host innate immune responses  its function in autophagy regulation however remains unexplored. In the present study  the function of DUSP5 in autophagy in Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-infected RAW264.7 cells  a murine macrophage-like cell line  was examined by assessing the alteration of the cell morphology  expression of autophagy markers  and ERK1/2 signaling activation. The results demonstrated that the BCG infection could induce DUSP5 expression and activate ERK1/2 signaling in RAW264.7 cells; an activation of ERK1/2 signaling contributed to autophagic process in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover  DUSP5 knockdown increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins (Atgs)  including LC3-II  Beclin1  Atg5 and Atg7. However  an overexpression of DUSP5 exhibited an opposite effect. Mechanistically  DUSP5 could inhibit the formation of autophagosome by suppressing the phosphorylation of signaling molecules in ERK1/2 signaling cascade. This study thus demonstrated a novel role of DUSP5 in modulating autophagy inRAW264.7 cells in response to BCG infection in particular  and autophagy macrophage to Mtb in general.,Autophagy_notLIR
Differential expression of MAGEA6 toggles autophagy to promote pancreatic cancer progression.The melanoma-associated antigen family A (MAGEA) antigens are expressed in a wide variety of malignant tumors but not in adult somatic cells  rendering them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that a number of cancer-associated MAGEA mutants that undergo proteasome-dependent degradation in vitro could negatively impact their utility as immunotherapeutic targets. Importantly  in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell models  MAGEA6 suppresses macroautophagy (autophagy). The inhibition of autophagy is released upon MAGEA6 degradation  which can be induced by nutrient deficiency or by acquisition of cancer-associated mutations. Using xenograft mouse models  we demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy is critical for tumor initiation whereas reinstitution of autophagy as a consequence of MAGEA6 degradation contributes to tumor progression. These findings could inform cancer immunotherapeutic strategies for targeting MAGEA antigens and provide mechanistic insight into the divergent roles of <i>MAGEA6</i> during pancreatic cancer initiation and progression.,Autophagy_notLIR

Complement Component C3 Is Highly Expressed in Human Pancreatic Islets and Prevents β Cell Death via ATG16L1 Interaction and Autophagy Regulation.We show here that human pancreatic islets highly express C3  which is both secreted and present in the cytosol. Within isolated human islets  C3 expression correlates with type 2 diabetes (T2D) donor status  HbA1c  and inflammation. Islet C3 expression is also upregulated in several rodent diabetes models. C3 interacts with ATG16L1  which is essential for autophagy. Autophagy relieves cellular stresses faced by β cells during T2D and maintains cellular homeostasis. C3 knockout in clonal β cells impaired autophagy and led to increased apoptosis after exposure of cells to palmitic acid and IAPP. In the absence of C3  autophagosomes do not undergo fusion with lysosomes. Thus  C3 may be upregulated in islets during T2D as a cytoprotective factor against β cell dysfunction caused by impaired autophagy. Therefore  we revealed a previously undescribed intracellular function for C3  connecting the complement system directly to autophagy  with a broad potential importance in other diseases and cell types.,Autophagy_notLIR
ATG5 in microglia does not contribute vitally to autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice.Microglia  resident myeloid immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS)  actively shape the circuitry of the brain  maintain CNS homeostasis during the steady state and orchestrate immune responses upon CNS injury. Both canonical and non-canonical functions of the macroautophagy/autophagy-related protein ATG5 regulate myeloid cell survival and immune responses. Here  we report that loss of ATG5 in postnatal microglia does not perturb CNS tissue integrity  microglial cell survival  or immune activation. Learning task performances were unchanged in mutant mice. Furthermore  lack of ATG5 expression in microglia had no impact on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These data indicate that  basal autophagy  identified to be essential for the survival and function of neuronal cells  is not required to maintain CNS homeostasis if absent in adult microglia and ATG5 expression is dispensable for the development of autoimmune neuroinflammation.<b>Abbreviations</b> Ag  antigen; APC  antigen presenting cell; ATG/<i>Atg</i>  autophagy-related; CD  cluster of differentiation; CNS  central nervous system; DC  dendritic cell; EAE  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; fl  floxed; LAP  LC3-associated phagocytosis; LC3  microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MFI  median fluorescence intensity; MHCII  major histocompatibility complex class II; MOG  myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; MS  multiple sclerosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ginkgolic acid promotes autophagy-dependent clearance of intracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates.The accumulation of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies) composed of aggregates of the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein is the principal pathological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) and may lead to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. To date there is no medication that can promote the efficient clearance of these pathological aggregates. In this study  the effect on α-syn aggregate clearance of ginkgolic acid (GA)  a natural compound extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves that inhibits SUMOylation amongst other pathways  was assessed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and rat primary cortical neurons. Depolarization of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and rat primary cortical neurons with KCl was used to induce α-syn aggregate formation. Cells pre-treated with either GA or the related compound  anacardic acid  revealed a significant decrease in intracytoplasmic aggregates immunopositive for α-syn and SUMO-1. An increased frequency of autophagosomes was also detected with both compounds. GA post-treatment 24 h after depolarization also significantly diminished α-syn aggregate bearing cells  indicating the clearance of pre-formed aggregates. Autophagy inhibitors blocked GA-dependent clearance of α-syn aggregates  but not increased autophagosome frequency. Western analysis revealed that the reduction in α-syn aggregate frequency obtained with GA pre-treatment was accompanied by little change in the abundance of SUMO conjugates. The current findings show that GA can promote autophagy-dependent clearance of α-syn aggregates and may have potential in disease modifying therapy.,Autophagy_notLIR

PPARα Between Aspirin and Plaque Clearance.Mounting evidence has identified that impaired amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance might contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The lysosome-autophagy network plays an important role in protein homeostasis and cell health by removing abnormal protein aggregates via intracellular degradation. Therefore  stimulation of cellular degradative machinery for efficient removal of Aβ has emerged as a growing field in AD research. However  mechanisms controlling such pathways and drugs to promote such mechanisms are poorly understood. Aspirin is a widely used drug throughout the world and recent studies have identified a new function of this drug. At low doses  aspirin stimulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy to clear amyloid plaques in an animal model of AD. This review delineates such functions of aspirin and analyzes underlying mechanisms that involve peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα)-mediated transcription of transcription factor EB (TFEB)  the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
A C4N4 Diaminopyrimidine Fluorophore.A new scaffold for producing efficient organic fluorescent materials was identified: 2 5-diamino-4 6-diarylpyrimidine featuring a C4N4 elemental composition. Single-step installation of two aryl groups at the 4 6-positions of the pyrimidine core delivered fluorescent organic materials in a modular fashion. A range of fluorescent compounds with distinct absorption/emission properties was readily accessed by changing the aromatic attachments. A generally high absorption coefficient and quantum yield were observed  including C4N4 derivatives that could fluoresce even in the solid state. The two amino groups at the 2 5-positions of the pyrimidine were essential for intense fluorescence with a large Stokes shift  which was corroborated by structural relaxation to a p-iminoquinone-like structure in the excited state. Besides live-cell imaging capabilities  fluorescent labeling of a protein involved in autophagy elucidated a new protein-protein interaction  supporting potential utility in bioimaging applications.,Autophagy_notLIR
SIRT3 promotes antimycobacterial defenses by coordinating mitochondrial and autophagic functions.SIRT3 (sirtuin 3)  a mitochondrial protein deacetylase  maintains respiratory function  but its role in the regulation of innate immune defense is largely unknown. Herein  we show that SIRT3 coordinates mitochondrial function and macroautophagy/autophagy activation to promote anti-mycobacterial responses through PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha). SIRT3 deficiency enhanced inflammatory responses and mitochondrial dysfunction  leading to defective host defense and pathological inflammation during mycobacterial infection. Antibody-mediated depletion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils significantly increased protection against mycobacterial infection in <i>sirt3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. In addition  mitochondrial oxidative stress promoted excessive inflammation induced by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection in <i>sirt3<sup>-/-</sup></i> macrophages. Notably  SIRT3 was essential for the enhancement of PPARA  a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy activation in the context of infection. Importantly  overexpression of either PPARA or TFEB (transcription factor EB) in <i>sirt3<sup>-/-</sup></i> macrophages recovered antimicrobial activity through autophagy activation. Furthermore  pharmacological activation of SIRT3 enhanced antibacterial autophagy and functional mitochondrial pools during mycobacterial infection. Finally  the levels of <i>SIRT3</i> and <i>PPARA</i> were downregulated and inversely correlated with <i>TNF</i> (tumor necrosis factor) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from tuberculosis patients. Collectively  these data demonstrate a previously unappreciated function of SIRT3 in orchestrating mitochondrial and autophagic functions to promote antimycobacterial responses. <b>Abbreviations:</b> Ab: antibody; BCG: <i>M. bovis</i> Bacillus Calmette-Guérin; Baf-A<sub>1</sub>: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CFU: colony forming unit; CXCL5: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; ERFP: enhanced red fluorescent protein; FOXO3: forkhead box O3; HC: healthy controls; H&E: haematoxylin and eosin; HKL: honokiol; IHC: immunohistochemistry; IL1B: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; IL12B: interleukin 12B; MDMs: monocyte-derived macrophages; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; Mtb: <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PMN: polymorphonuclear neutrophil; PPARA: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SIRT3: sirtuin 3; TB: tuberculosis; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.,Autophagy_notLIR
EXO70D isoforms mediate selective autophagic degradation of type-A ARR proteins to regulate cytokinin sensitivity.The phytohormone cytokinin influences many aspects of plant growth and development  several of which also involve the cellular process of autophagy  including leaf senescence  nutrient remobilization  and developmental transitions. The <i>Arabidopsis</i> type-A response regulators (type-A ARR) are negative regulators of cytokinin signaling that are transcriptionally induced in response to cytokinin. Here  we describe a mechanistic link between cytokinin signaling and autophagy  demonstrating that plants modulate cytokinin sensitivity through autophagic regulation of type-A ARR proteins. Type-A ARR proteins were degraded by autophagy in an AUTOPHAGY-RELATED (ATG)5-dependent manner  and this degradation is promoted by phosphorylation on a conserved aspartate in the receiver domain of the type-A ARRs. EXO70D family members interacted with type-A ARR proteins  likely in a phosphorylation-dependent manner  and recruited them to autophagosomes via interaction of the EXO70D AIM with the core autophagy protein  ATG8. Consistently  loss-of-function <i>exo70D1 2 3</i> mutants exhibited compromised targeting of type-A ARRs to autophagic vesicles  have elevated levels of type-A ARR proteins  and are hyposensitive to cytokinin. Disruption of both type-A <i>ARRs</i> and <i>EXO70D1 2 3</i> compromised survival in carbon-deficient conditions  suggesting interaction between autophagy and cytokinin responsiveness in response to stress. These results indicate that the EXO70D proteins act as selective autophagy receptors to target type-A ARR cargos for autophagic degradation  demonstrating modulation of cytokinin signaling by selective autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Zika virus NS2A protein induces the degradation of KPNA2 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) via chaperone-mediated autophagy.KPNA2/importin-alpha1 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) is the primary nucleocytoplasmic transporter for some transcription factors to activate cellular proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant increase of KPNA2 level is identified as a prognostic marker in a variety of cancers. Yet  the turnover mechanism of KPNA2 remains unknown. Here  we demonstrate that KPNA2 is degraded via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and that Zika virus (ZIKV) enhances the KPNA2 degradation. KPNA2 contains a CMA motif  which possesses an indispensable residue Gln109 for the CMA-mediated degradation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAMP2A  a vital component of the CMA pathway  led to a higher level of KPNA2. Moreover  ZIKV reduced KPNA2 via the viral NS2A protein  which contains an essential residue Thr100 for inducing the CMA-mediated KPNA2 degradation. Notably  mutant ZIKV with T100A alteration in NS2A replicates much weaker than the wild-type virus. Also  knockdown of KPNA2 led to a higher ZIKV viral yield  which indicates that KPNA2 mediates certain antiviral effects. These data provide insights into the KPNA2 turnover and the ZIKV-cell interactions.,Autophagy_notLIR
Nerve growth factor induced farnesoid X receptor upregulation modulates autophagy flux and protects hepatocytes in cholestatic livers.Upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) in parenchymal hepatocytes has been shown to exert hepatoprotective function during cholestatic liver injury. However  the modulatory role of NGF in regulation of liver autophagy remains unclear. This study aimed to scrutinize the regulatory role of NGF in hepatic expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)  a bile acid (BA)-activated nuclear receptor  and to determine its cytoprotective effect on BA-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity. Livers of human hepatolithiasis and bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced mouse cholestasis were used for histopathological and molecular detection. The regulatory roles of NGF in autophagy flux and FXR expression  as well as its hepatoprotection against BA cytotoxicity were examined in cultured hepatocytes. FXR downregulation in human hepatolithiasis livers showed positive correlation with hepatic NGF levels. NGF administration upregulated hepatic FXR levels  while neutralization of NGF decreased FXR expression in BDL-induced cholestatic mouse livers. In vitro studies demonstrated that NGF upregulated FXR expression  increased cellular LC3 levels  and exerted hepatoprotective effect in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. Conversely  autophagy inhibition abrogated NGF-driven cytoprotection under BA exposure  suggesting involvement of NGF-modulated auophagy flux. Although FXR agonistic GW4064 stimulation did not affect auophagic LC3 levels  FXR activity inhibition significantly potentiated BA-induced cytotoxicity and increased cellular p62/SQSTM1 and Rab7 protein in SK-Hep1 hepatocytes. Moreover  FXR gene silencing abolished the protective effect of NGF under BA exposure. These findings support that NGF modulates autophagy flux via FXR upregulation and protects hepatocytes against BA-induced cytotoxicity. NGF/FXR axis is a novel therapeutic target for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Role of DRAM1 in mitophagy contributes to preeclampsia regulation in mice.Preeclampsia (PE) is a complication during pregnancy that is diagnosed by a new onset of hypertension and proteinuria. Although the pathogenesis of PE is not fully understood  a growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction might contribute to the progression of PE. Therefore  the aim of the present study was to determine the role of mitophagy in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in PE  and to evaluate the role of DNA damage‑regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) in the development of PE. First  a mouse model of PE induced by hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α was established  and high levels of oxidative stress  apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were found in the placentas of PE mice. Additionally  the placentas of PE mice exhibited decreased mitophagy and significantly decreased DRAM1 expression. To further explore the role of DRAM1 in mitophagy  DRAM1 was overexpressed in the placental tissues of PE mice  and this overexpression effectively improved the symptoms of PE mice and significantly reduced blood lipid and urine protein levels. DRAM1 overexpression also improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress in the placentas of PE mice. In addition  the overexpression of DRAM1 improved mitochondrial fusion and fission  and enhanced mitophagy. Altogether  these results indicated a key role for DRAM1 in mitophagy that contributed to the regulation of PE. To the best of the authors' knowledge  the present study provided the first evidence of a role for DRAM1 in PE  and offered novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PE.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Brain and Neuronal Aging: Aged Brain Controls via Gene Expression Fidelity and Master Regulatory Factors].Providing plausible strategies for brain aging protection should be a critical concern for countries with large elderly populations including Japan. Age-related cognitive impairments and movement disorders  such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases  are caused by neurodegeneration that primarily initiates in the hippocampus and the midbrain substantia nigra  respectively. Neurons are postmitotic  and therefore  the accuracy of cellular metabolism should be crucial for maintaining neural functions throughout their life. Thus accuracy of protein synthesis is a critical concern in discussing mechanisms of aging. The essence of the so-called "error catastrophe theory" of aging was on the fidelity of ribosomal translation and/or aminoacylation of tRNA. There is evidence that reduced protein synthesis accuracy results in neurodegeneration. Similarly  reduced proteostasis via autophagy and proteasomes in aging is crucial for protein quality control and well documented as a risk for aging. In both neurodegeneration and protein quality controls  various proteins are involved in their regulation  but recent evidence suggests that repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) could be a master regulatory protein that is crucial for orchestrating the neural protecting events in human brain aging. REST is induced in the aged brain  and protects neurons against oxidative stress and protein toxicity. Interestingly  REST is identical with neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)  the master regulator of neural development. Thus NRSF/REST play important roles in both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. In this review  I summarize the interesting scientific crossover  and discuss the potential use of NRSF/REST as a pharmaceutical target for controlling aging  particularly in relation to brain aging.,Autophagy_notLIR
Induction of autophagy enhances apoptotic cell death via epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition by canertinib in cervical cancer cells.It has been known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently overexpressed in cervical cancer.

Study of the Characterization of Side Population Cells in Endometrial Cancer Cell Lines: Chemoresistance  Progestin Resistance  and Radioresistance.<b>Introduction:</b> Radiotherapy  combined regimens as platinum-paclitaxel chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy is an important adjuvant treatment after surgery for endometrial cancer (EC). While  the resistance to them remain unclear. In our study  to separate the characteristics of side population (SP) cells from EC cell lines  study the mechanism of Taxol-resistance  progestin resistance and radioresistanc  and provide the basic for EC. <b>Methods:</b> SP cells from EC cell lines HEC-1A  Ishikawa and RL95-2 were separated by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry analysis. The expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in SP cells and non-SP cells from HEC-1A was examined by immunocytochemistry  and the radiation-resistant and Taxol-resistant characteristics of SP cells and non-SP cells were compared by MTS. Ishikawa  Ishikawa-SP  and Ishikawa-non-SP cells incubated with MPA were selected for cell apoptosis assays by using flow cytometry. The expression of caspase-3 was examined by immunocytochemistry  and autophagy was detected by MDC staining. <b>Results:</b> Small proportions of SP cells  namely  1.44 ± 0.93%  2.86 ± 3.09%  and 2.87 ± 1.29%  were detected in HEC-1A  Ishikawa and RL95-2  respectively. There was a stronger clone formation efficiency for the SP cells than for non-SP cells in HEC-1A [(6.02 ± 1.17) vs. (0.53±0.20)%  <i>P</i> = 0.001]  and there was a significant difference in the rate of tumourigenicity between the SP cells and non-SP cells in HEC-1A (87.5 vs. 12.5%). There were higher levels of BCRP expression (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and resistance to Taxol and radiation (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in the SP cells than in non-SP cells. After MPA treatment  the apoptosis rates were significantly different among the Ishikawa  Ishikawa-SP and Ishikawa-non-SP groups [(4.64 ± 0.18)%  (4.01 ± 0.43)%  and (9.3 ± 0.67)%; (<i>P</i> = 0.05)]  and the expression of Caspase-3 in the Ishikawa group was higher than that in Ishikawa-SP group. The autophagic activity of the Ishikawa-SP cells was the strongest  while the autophagic activity of Ishikawa-non-SP was the weakest. <b>Conclusions:</b> There is a significant enrichment in SP cells among different EC cell lines  and these SP cells be more resistant to Taxol  MPA and radiation therapy. The overexpression of BCRP among SP cells may be the cause of resistance to Taxol  progestin and radiotherapy  which may be related to apoptosis and autophagic activity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Si-Miao-Yong-An (SMYA) Decoction May Protect the Renal Function Through Regulating the Autophagy-Mediated Degradation of Ubiquitinated Protein in an Atherosclerosis Model.Hyperlipidemia is common  and its renal toxicity has attracted a great deal of attention. Si-miao-yong-an (SMYA) is a famous ancient decoction of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)  which is still widely used in clinical treatment. In this study  we observed and explored its efficacy and mechanism in protecting renal function in an atherosclerosis model. The results showed that the serum  Cr urinal KIM-1  and NGAL were significantly decreased in SMYA group. Although SMYA failed to alleviate the lipid accumulation  decrease p-NFκB  or increase SOD in kidney tissue  the levels of ubiquitinated protein and P62 were decreased in SMYA group. What is more  a higher LC3 II level was observed in the SMYA group. In conclusion  these data indicated that SMYA decoction may protect renal function in hyperlipidemia <i>via</i> regulating the autophagy-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated protein.,Autophagy_notLIR

lncRNA ZNF649-AS1 Induces Trastuzumab Resistance by Promoting ATG5 Expression and Autophagy.The regulatory mechanism of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in trastuzumab resistance is not well established to date. In this research  we identified differentially expressed lncRNA and investigated its regulatory role in trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer. HiSeq sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to identify the dysregulated lncRNAs. Mass spectrometry  RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH)  and immunoprecipitation assays were performed to identify the direct interactions between ZNF649-AS1 and other associated targets  such as polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) and autophagy related 5 (ATG5). Our results showed that ZNF649-AS1 was more highly expressed in trastuzumab-resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. Increased expression of ZNF649-AS1 was associated with a poorer response and shorter survival time of breast cancer patients. ZNF649-AS1 was upregulated by H3K27ac modification at the presence of trastuzumab treatment  and knockdown of ZNF649-AS1 reversed trastuzumab resistance via modulating ATG5 expression and autophagy. Mechanically  ZNF649-AS1 was associated with PTBP1 protein  which further promoted the transcription activity of the ATG5 gene. In conclusion  we demonstrated that H3K27ac modification-induced upregulation of ZNF649-AS1 could cause autophagy and trastuzumab resistance through associating with PTBP1 and promoting ATG5 transcription.,Autophagy_notLIR

Triangle collaboration assessment of autophagy  ER stress and hypoxia in leukemogenesis: a bright perspective on the molecular recognition of B-ALL.B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common acute leukemia in childhood and adults  which caused by many various crystalline and unclear agents. Owning to this matter  no significant progress has been made in the patients-recovery. Recently  autophagy pathway is considered as an ambiguous agent in leukemia evaluation. We aim to discover the expression levels of upstream autophagy-regulating genes in newly diagnosed B-ALL patients. In B-ALL group  <i>BECN1</i>  <i>HIF1A</i> and <i>ERN1</i> expressions were significantly down-regulated  while <i>BCL2</i> expression was up-regulated compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < .05). Moreover  there was significant positive correlation between the decreased <i>BECN1</i> compared with Hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes expression in the patients (<i>p</i> < .05). Our findings revealed that  <i>ERN1</i> and ER stress pathway-related genes could be effective regulators of autophagy in B-ALL. More investigation is recommended to gain a deeper understanding into molecular pathophysiology of B-ALL to improve treatment and monitoring approaches in affected patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy: self-digestion for metabolic health.Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health challenge. Therefore  understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of T2DM is key to improving current therapies. Loss of protein homeostasis leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins in cells  which results in tissue dysfunction. The elimination of damaged proteins occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. In this review  we describe the mutual regulation between the UPS and autophagy and the involvement of these two proteolytic systems in metabolic dysregulation  insulin resistance  and T2DM. We propose that alterations in the UPS or autophagy contribute to triggering insulin resistance and the development of T2DM. In addition  these two pathways emerge as promising therapeutic targets for improving insulin resistance.,Autophagy_notLIR
The interplay between selective types of (macro)autophagy: Mitophagy and xenophagy.Autophagy is a physiological response  activated by a myriad of endogenous and exogenous cues  including DNA damage  perturbation of proteostasis  depletion of nutrients or oxygen and pathogen infection. Upon sensing those stimuli  cells employ multiple non-selective and selective autophagy pathways to promote fitness and survival. Importantly  there are a variety of selective types of autophagy. In this review we will focus on autophagy of bacteria (xenophagy) and autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy). We provide a brief introduction to bulk autophagy  as well as xenophagy and mitophagy  highlighting their common molecular factors. We also describe the role of xenophagy and mitophagy in the detection and elimination of pathogens by the immune system and the adaptive mechanisms that some pathogens have developed through evolution to escape the host autophagic response. Finally  we summarize the recent articles (from the last five years) linking bulk autophagy with xenophagy and/or mitophagy in the context on developmental biology  cancer and metabolism.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mitophagy in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy: Roles and Mechanisms.Cardiovascular disease is the leading complication of diabetes mellitus (DM)  and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of mortality in diabetic patients. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms  including myocardial insulin resistance  oxidative stress and inflammation  are involved in the development of DCM. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction makes a substantial contribution to the development of DCM. Mitophagy is a type of autophagy that takes place in dysfunctional mitochondria  and it plays a key role in mitochondrial quality control. Although the precise molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in DCM have yet to be fully clarified  recent findings imply that mitophagy improves cardiac function in the diabetic heart. However  excessive mitophagy may exacerbate myocardial damage in patients with DCM. In this review  we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of mitochondrial quality control and the dual roles of mitophagy in DCM. We also propose that a balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy is essential for the maintenance of cellular metabolism in the diabetic heart.,Autophagy_notLIR
Activation of microlipophagy during early infection of insect hosts by <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i>.The requirement of macroautophagic/autophagic machinery for filamentous fungal development and pathogenicity has been recognized  but the underlying effects and mechanisms remain elusive. The insect pathogenic fungus <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> infects hosts by cuticular penetration through the formation of the infection structure appressoria. Here  we show that autophagic fluxes were highly activated during the appressorial formation of <i>M. robertsii</i>. Genome-wide deletion of the autophagy-related genes and insect bioassays identified 10 of 23 encoded <i>MrATG</i> genes with requirements for topical fungal infection of insect hosts. Besides the defect in forming appressoria on insects (two null mutants)  these virulence-reduced mutants were largely impaired in penetrating cellophane membrane and insect cuticles  suggesting their failures in generating proper appressorium turgor. We found that the conidial storage of lipid droplets (LDs) had no obvious difference between strains  but autophagic LD degradation was impaired in different mutants. After induction of cell autophagy by nitrogen starvation  we found that LD entry into vacuoles was unaffected in the selected mutant cells with potential failures in forming autophagosomes. The finding therefore reveals a microlipophagy machinery employed in this fungus and that the direct engulfment of LDs occurs without inhibition by the downstream defective lipolysis. Our data first unveil the activation and contribution of microlipophagy to fungal infection biology. The obtained technique may benefit future detection of microlipophagy in different organisms by examining vacuolar or lysosomal engulfment of LDs in core autophagic gene deletion mutants.<b>Abbreviations</b>: AIM: Atg8-family interacting motif; ATG: autophagy-related; CM: complete medium; CMAC: 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin; DTT: dithiothreitol; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; GFP: green fluorescent protein; LD  lipid droplet; MM: minimum medium; MM-N: minimum medium without nitrogen source; PDA: potato dextrose agar; PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RFP: red fluorescent protein; SDB: Sabouraud dextrose broth; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TAG: triacylglycerol; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; WT  wild type.,Autophagy_notLIR
Functional and biological heterogeneity of KRAS<sup>Q61</sup> mutations.Missense mutations at the three hotspots in the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS-Gly<sup>12</sup>  Gly<sup>13</sup>  and Gln<sup>61</sup> (commonly known as G12  G13  and Q61  respectively)-occur differentially among the three RAS isoforms. Q61 mutations in <i>KRAS</i> are infrequent and differ markedly in occurrence. Q61H is the predominant mutant (at 57%)  followed by Q61R/L/K (collectively 40%)  and Q61P and Q61E are the rarest (2 and 1%  respectively). Probability analysis suggested that mutational susceptibility to different DNA base changes cannot account for this distribution. Therefore  we investigated whether these frequencies might be explained by differences in the biochemical  structural  and biological properties of KRAS<sup>Q61</sup> mutants. Expression of KRAS<sup>Q61</sup> mutants in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RIE-1 epithelial cells caused various alterations in morphology  growth transformation  effector signaling  and metabolism. The relatively rare KRAS<sup>Q61E</sup> mutant stimulated actin stress fiber formation  a phenotype distinct from that of KRAS<sup>Q61H/R/L/P</sup>  which disrupted actin cytoskeletal organization. The crystal structure of KRAS<sup>Q61E</sup> was unexpectedly similar to that of wild-type KRAS  a potential basis for its weak oncogenicity. KRAS<sup>Q61H/L/R</sup>-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines exhibited KRAS-dependent growth and  as observed with KRAS<sup>G12</sup>-mutant PDAC  were susceptible to concurrent inhibition of ERK-MAPK signaling and of autophagy. Our results uncover phenotypic heterogeneity among KRAS<sup>Q61</sup> mutants and support the potential utility of therapeutic strategies that target KRAS<sup>Q61</sup> mutant-specific signaling and cellular output.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pathological Nuclear Hallmarks in Dentate Granule Cells of Alzheimer's Patients: A Biphasic Regulation of Neurogenesis.The dentate gyrus (DG) of the human hippocampus is a complex and dynamic structure harboring mature and immature granular neurons in diverse proliferative states. While most mammals show persistent neurogenesis through adulthood  human neurogenesis is still under debate. We found nuclear alterations in granular cells in autopsied human brains  detected by immunohistochemistry. These alterations differ from those reported in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal circuit. Aging and early AD chromatin were clearly differentiated by the increased epigenetic markers H3K9me3 (heterochromatin suppressive mark) and H3K4me3 (transcriptional euchromatin mark). At early AD stages  lamin B2 was redistributed to the nucleoplasm  indicating cell-cycle reactivation  probably induced by hippocampal nuclear pathology. At intermediate and late AD stages  higher lamin B2 immunopositivity in the perinucleus suggests fewer immature neurons  less neurogenesis  and fewer adaptation resources to environmental factors. In addition  senile samples showed increased nuclear Tau interacting with aged chromatin  likely favoring DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability. However  at late AD stages  the progressive disappearance of phosphorylated Tau forms in the nucleus  increased chromatin disorganization  and increased nuclear autophagy support a model of biphasic neurogenesis in AD. Therefore  designing therapies to alleviate the neuronal nuclear pathology might be the only pathway to a true rejuvenation of brain circuits.,Autophagy_notLIR
Vici syndrome in Israel: Clinical and molecular insights.<b>Introduction:</b> Vici Syndrome is a rare  severe  neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorder with multi-systemic manifestations presenting in infancy. It is mainly characterized by global developmental delay  seizures  agenesis of the corpus callosum  hair and skin hypopigmentation  bilateral cataract  and varying degrees of immunodeficiency  among other features. Vici Syndrome is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>EPG5</i>  resulting in impaired autophagy. Thus far  the condition has been reported in less than a hundred individuals. <b>Objective and Methods:</b> We aimed to characterize the clinical and molecular findings in individuals harboring biallelic <i>EPG5</i> variants  recruited from four medical centers in Israel. Furthermore  we aimed to utilize a machine learning-based tool to assess facial features of Vici syndrome. <b>Results:</b> Eleven cases of Vici Syndrome from five unrelated families  one of which was diagnosed prenatally with subsequent termination of pregnancy  were recruited. A total of five disease causing variants were detected in <i>EPG5</i>: two novel: c.2554-5A>G and c.1461delC; and 3 previously reported: c.3447G>A  c.5993C>G  and c.1007A>G  the latter previously identified in several patients of Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) descent. Amongst 140 491 individuals screened by the Dor Yeshorim Program  we show that the c.1007A>G variant has an overall carrier frequency of 0.45% (1 in 224) among AJ individuals. Finally  based on two-dimensional facial photographs of individuals with Vici syndrome (<i>n</i> = 19)  a composite facial mask was created using the DeepGestalt algorithm  illustrating facial features typical of this disorder. <b>Conclusion:</b> We report on ten children and one fetus from five unrelated families  affected with Vici syndrome  and describe prenatal and postnatal characteristics. Our findings contribute to the current knowledge regarding the molecular basis and phenotypic features of this rare syndrome.

Novel glycosylation zinc(II)-cryptolepine complexes perturb mitophagy pathways and trigger cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy in SK-OV-3/DDP cells.With the aim of shedding some light on the mechanism of action of zinc(II) complexes in antiproliferative processes and molecular signaling pathways  three novel glycosylated zinc(II)-cryptolepine complexes  i.e.  [Zn(QA1)Cl<sub>2</sub>] (Zn(QA1))  [Zn(QA2)Cl<sub>2</sub>] (Zn(QA2))  and [Zn(QA3)Cl<sub>2</sub>] (Zn(QA3))  were prepared by conjugating a glucose moiety with cryptolepine  followed by complexation of the resulting glycosylated cryptolepine compounds N-((1-(2-morpholinoethyl)-1H-1 2 3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-benzofuro[3 2-b]quinolin-11-amine (QA1)  2-(4-((benzofuro[3 2-b]quinolin-11-ylamino)methyl)-1H-1 2 3-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol (QA2)  and (2S 3S 4R 5R 6S)-2-(4-((benzofuro[3 2-b]quinolin-11-ylamino)-methyl)-1H-1 2 3-triazol-1-yl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3 4 5-triol (QA3) with zinc(II)  and their anticancer activity was evaluated. In MTT assays  Zn(QA1)-Zn(QA3) were more active against cisplatin-resistant ovarian SK-OV-3/DDP cancer cells (SK-OV-3cis) than ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and the QA1-QA3 ligands  with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.81 ± 0.50  2.92 ± 0.32  and 1.01 ± 0.11 μM  respectively. Complexation of glycosylated cryptolepine QA3 with zinc(II) increased the antiproliferative activity of the ligand  suggesting that Zn(QA3) could act as a chaperone to deliver the active ligand intracellularly  in contrast with other cryptolepine metal complexes previously reported. In vivo and in vitro investigations suggested that Zn(QA3) exhibited enhanced anticancer activity with treatment effects comparable to those of the clinical drug cisplatin. Furthermore  Zn(QA1)-Zn(QA3) triggered SK-OV-3cis cell apoptosis through mitophagy pathways in the order Zn(QA1) > Zn(QA1) > Zn(QA2). These results demonstrate the potential of glycosylated zinc(II)-cryptolepine complexes for the development of chemotherapy drugs against cisplatin-resistant SK-OV-3cis cells.,Autophagy_notLIR

Ketamine: Neuroprotective or Neurotoxic?Ketamine  a non-competitive <i>N-</i>methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist  has been employed clinically as an intravenous anesthetic since the 1970s. More recently  ketamine has received attention for its rapid antidepressant effects and is actively being explored as a treatment for a wide range of neuropsychiatric syndromes. In model systems  ketamine appears to display a combination of neurotoxic and neuroprotective properties that are context dependent. At anesthetic doses applied during neurodevelopmental windows  ketamine contributes to inflammation  autophagy  apoptosis  and enhances levels of reactive oxygen species. At the same time  subanesthetic dose ketamine is a powerful activator of multiple parallel neurotrophic signaling cascades with neuroprotective actions that are not always NMDAR-dependent. Here  we summarize results from an array of preclinical studies that highlight a complex landscape of intracellular signaling pathways modulated by ketamine and juxtapose the somewhat contrasting neuroprotective and neurotoxic features of this drug.,Autophagy_notLIR
A Combination Therapy of Urolithin A+EGCG Has Stronger Protective Effects than Single Drug Urolithin A in a Humanized Amyloid Beta Knockin Mice for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.In the current study  for the first time  we study mitophagy enhancer urolithin A and a combination of urolithin A+green tea extract EGCG against human Aβ peptide-induced mitochondrial and synaptic  dendritic  inflammatory toxicities and behavioral changes in humanized homozygous amyloid beta knockin (hAbKI) mice of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our findings reveal significantly increased positive effects of urolithin A and a combination treatment of urolithin A+EGCG in hAbKI mice for phenotypic behavioral changes including motor coordination  locomotion/exploratory activity  spatial learning and working memory. mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fusion  synaptic  mitophagy and autophagy genes were upregulated  and mitochondrial fission genes are downregulated in urolithin A and combine treatment in hAbKI mice; however  the effect is stronger in combined treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal brain sections shows similar findings of mRNA and protein levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction is significantly reduced in both treatment groups  but a stronger reduction is observed in combined treatment. Dendritic spines and lengths are significantly increased in both treatment groups  but the effect is stronger in combined treatment. The fragmented number of mitochondria is reduced  and mitochondrial length is increased  and mitophagosomal formations are increased in both the groups  but the effect is stronger in the combined treatment. The levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 are reduced in both treatments  however  the reduction is higher for combined treatment. These observations suggest that urolithin A is protective against human Aβ peptide-induced toxicities; however  combined treatment of urolithin A+EGCG is effective and stronger  indicating that combined therapy is promising to treat late-onset AD patients.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification of key genes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using integrated network analysis of differential lncRNA and gene expression.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex heterogeneous heart disease.

Protective Effect of Keluoxin against Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Mellitus Models.Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic kidney disease that develops in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Renal dysfunction and persistent proteinuria are the main clinical features of DN. Podocyte injury is an important cause of persistent proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Traditional Chinese patent medicines can improve renal function by enhancing autophagy and promoting apoptosis. Keluoxin is a Chinese patent medicine that has the effect of invigorating qi and nourishing yin  activating blood  and eliminating blood stasis. Therefore  we hypothesized that Keluoxin may have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy in rats with type 2 DM. Rats induced with diabetes through streptozocin (STZ) injection and a high-fat and high-sugar diet were treated with Keluoxin (0.63 g/kg/day) for 8 weeks  and renal function  biochemical indicators  and histopathological changes in renal tissues were observed. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of autophagy-related proteins. The results showed that Keluoxin reduced blood glucose and lipid levels  improved renal function  and alleviated renal histopathological changes in rats with DN. The therapeutic effect was similar to that of Irbesartan (15.6 mg/kg/day). It is inferred that the mechanism works through reducing the obstruction of downstream pathways of autophagy by improving the lysosomal degradation function and alleviating podocyte injury. This study demonstrates that Keluoxin could regulate autophagy in podocytes  alleviate kidney injury in rats with DN  and have a protective effect on renal function; its mechanism can thus be a potential therapy for DN.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagy-mediated negative feedback attenuates the oncogenic activity of YAP in pancreatic cancer.Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal malignancy in humans  and new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a significant role in cancer progression. Autophagy is also closely associated with various human cancers. However  the interplay between YAP and autophagy in PDAC remains poorly understood. In this study  we found that YAP was upregulated and activated in PDAC. Further analysis revealed that there is a YAP-autophagy feedback loop in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically  YAP activates autophagy by promoting Atg5 transcription via TEAD1-mediated binding  while autophagy negatively regulates YAP through autophagic degradation. The hyperactivation of YAP in PDAC unbalances the YAP-autophagy circuit and promotes cancer progression. Inhibition of autophagy enhances the oncogenic activity of YAP in PDAC. The autophagy activator rapamycin promotes the antitumor effect of verteporfin  a YAP inhibitor. Therefore  our study elucidated the interaction between YAP and autophagy in PDAC and our results suggest that targeting the YAP-autophagy circuit may be a new therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
Gambogenic acid induces apoptosis and autophagy through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress via JNK pathway in prostate cancer cells.Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignant tumor in males  which frequently develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with limited therapies. Gambogenic acid (GNA)  a flavonoids compound isolated from Gamboge  exhibits anti-tumor capacity in various cancers. Our results showed that GNA revealed not only antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities but also the induction of autophagy in PCa cells. In addition  autophagy inhibitor chloroquine enhanced the pro-apoptosis effect of GNA. Moreover  the activation of JNK pathway and the induction of apoptosis and autophagy triggered by GNA were attenuated by JNK inhibitor SP600125. We also found that GNA significantly promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Meanwhile  suppressing ER stress with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) markedly blocked the activation of JNK pathway induced by GNA. Further research indicated that ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) effectively abrogated ER stress and JNK pathway activation induced by GNA. Furthermore  NAC and 4-PBA significantly reversed GNA-triggered apoptosis and autophagy. Finally  GNA remarkably suppressed prostate tumor growth with low toxicity in vivo. In conclusion  the present study revealed that GNA induced apoptosis and autophagy through ROS-mediated ER stress via JNK signaling pathway in PCa cells. Thus  GNA might be a promising therapeutic drug against PCa.,Autophagy_notLIR
Paradoxical downregulation of LPAR3 exerts tumor-promoting activity through autophagy induction in Ras-transformed cells.Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPAR3) is coupled to Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and Gα<sub>11/q</sub> signaling.

Here  we demonstrate that LPAR3 exhibits malignant transforming activities  despite being downregulated in transformed cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cross-Species and Human Inter-Tissue Network Analysis of Genes Implicated in Longevity and Aging Reveal Strong Support for Nutrient Sensing.Intensive research efforts have been undertaken to slow human aging and therefore potentially delay the onset of age-related diseases. These efforts have generated an enormous amount of high-throughput data covering different levels in the physiologic hierarchy  e.g.  genetic  epigenetic  transcriptomic  proteomic  and metabolomic  etc. We gathered 15 independent sources of information about genes potentially involved in human longevity and lifespan (<i>N</i> = 5836) and subjected them to various integrated analyses. Many of these genes were initially identified in non-human species  and we investigated their orthologs in three non-human species [i.e.  mice (<i>N</i> = 967)  fruit fly (<i>N</i> = 449)  and worm (<i>N</i> = 411)] for further analysis. We characterized experimentally determined protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) involving each species' genes from 9 known protein databases and studied the enriched biological pathways among the individually constructed PPINs. We observed three important signaling pathways: FoxO signaling  mTOR signaling  and autophagy to be common and highly enriched in all four species (<i>p</i>-value ≤ 0.001). Our study implies that the interaction of proteins involved in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is somewhat limited to each species or that a "rewiring" of specific networks has taken place over time. To corroborate our findings  we repeated our analysis in 43 different human tissues. We investigated conserved modules in various tissue-specific PPINs of the longevity-associated genes based upon their protein expression. This analysis also revealed mTOR signaling as shared biological processes across four different human tissue-specific PPINs for liver  heart  skeletal muscle  and adipose tissue. Further  we explored our results' translational potential by assessing the protein interactions with all the reported drugs and compounds that have been experimentally verified to promote longevity in the three-comparator species. We observed that the target proteins of the FDA-approved drug rapamycin (a known inhibitor of mTOR) were conserved across all four species. Drugs like melatonin and metformin exhibited shared targets with rapamycin in the human PPIN. The detailed information about the curated gene list  cross-species orthologs  PPIN  and pathways was assembled in an interactive data visualization portal using RStudio's Shiny framework (https://agingnetwork.shinyapps.io/frontiers/).,Autophagy_notLIR
Super-resolution analyzing spatial organization of lysosomes with an organic fluorescent probe.Lysosomes are multifunctional organelles involved in macromolecule degradation  nutrient sensing and autophagy. Live imaging has revealed lysosome subpopulations with dynamics and characteristic cellular localization. An as-yet unanswered question is whether lysosomes are spatially organized to coordinate and integrate their functions. Combined with super-resolution microscopy  we designed a small organic fluorescent probe  TPAE  that targeted lysosomes with a large Stokes shift. When we analyzed the spatial organization of lysosomes against mitochondria in different cell lines with this probe  we discovered different distance distribution patterns between lysosomes and mitochondria during increased autophagy flux. By using <i>SLC25A46</i> mutation fibroblasts derived from patients containing highly fused mitochondria with low oxidative phosphorylation  we concluded that unhealthy mitochondria redistributed the subcellular localization of lysosomes  which implies a strong connection between mitochondria and lysosomes.,Autophagy_notLIR
The nephrotoxic potential of polystyrene microplastics at realistic environmental concentrations.As microplastics (MPs) dispersed into the environment  people might be exposed to MPs. Most pollutants either pass through or concentrate in the kidney. Therefore  nephrotoxicity tests are needed to verify the toxic potential of MPs. Here we used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to determine the association between nephrotoxicity and round-shape polystyrene MPs (PSMPs) (3.54 ± 0.39 μm) under realistic environmental exposure concentrations. Results revealed that PSMPs can adhere to the cell membrane and get entirely engulfed by HEK293 cells. PSMPs can induce cytotoxicity by oxidative stress via inhibition of the antioxidant haem oxygenase-1. Depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and formation of autophagosomes confirmed that apoptosis and autophagy can be simultaneously induced by PSMPs. The inflammatory factor was only activated (33 cytokines) by noncytotoxic concentration of PSMPs (3 ng/mL); however  the cytotoxic concentration (300 ng/mL) of PSMPs induced autophagy  which might further reduce NLRP3 expression  thus contributing to dampening inflammation (35 cytokines) in HEK293 cells. PSMPs (300 ng/mL) can impair kidney barrier integrity and increase the probability of developing acute kidney injury through the depletion of the zonula occludens-2 proteins and α1-antitrypsin. Altogether  our results demonstrated that environmental exposure to PSMPs may lead to an increased risk of renal disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Exposure to arsenic at different life-stages and DNA methylation meta-analysis in buccal cells and leukocytes.Arsenic (As) exposure through drinking water is a global public health concern. Epigenetic dysregulation including changes in DNA methylation (DNAm)  may be involved in arsenic toxicity. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of arsenic exposure have been restricted to single populations and comparison across EWAS has been limited by methodological differences. Leveraging data from epidemiological studies conducted in Chile and Bangladesh  we use a harmonized data processing and analysis pipeline and meta-analysis to combine results from four EWAS.,Autophagy_notLIR
Features of the Population of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages Isolated after Stimulation with Concanavalin A and Thioglycolate.Murine peritoneal macrophages isolated from the lavage fluid after administration of thioglycolate and concanavalin A are presented by two populations of cells of different diameters. Polarization of macrophages into a proinflammatory (M1) phenotype is accompanied by an increase in number of small cells. Macrophages obtained after administration of thioglycolate demonstrate higher tendency to anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype  while macrophages isolated after administration of concanavalin A are committed in the proinflammatory direction. Lactate level is increased in M1 macrophages in comparison with M2 cells  which indicates predominance of glycolytic metabolism. Macrophages obtained after administration of concanavalin A have reduced mitochondrial potential  which reflects a tendency to apoptosis. Autophagy activation and inhibition neutralize the differences in pro- and anti-inflammatory properties of polarized macrophages obtained after thioglycolate administration  but have less pronounced effect on macrophages obtained after administration concanavalin A. Autophagy inhibitor increases mitochondrial potential in non-polarized macrophages obtained after administration of concanavalin A. These results demonstrate divergent properties of macrophages obtained after administration of glycolate and concanavalin A due to the difference in the mechanisms of experimental peritonitis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Inhibition of the BNIP3/NIX-dependent mitophagy aggravates copper-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in duck renal tubular epithelial cells.The accumulation of copper (Cu) in the organisms could lead to kidney damage by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Given that mitochondria are one of the targets of Cu poisoning  this study aimed to investigate the role of mitophagy in Cu-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular epithelial cells to understand the mechanism of Cu nephrotoxicity. Hence  the cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub> ) (0  100  and 200 μM)  and mitophagy inhibitor (Cyclosporine A  0.5 μM) and/or 200 μM CuSO<sub>4</sub> in the combination for 12 h. Results showed that Cu caused mitochondrial swelling  vacuoles  and cristae fracture; increased the number of mitochondrial and lysosome fluorescent aggregation points; upregulated the mRNA levels of mitophagy-associated genes (LC3A  LC3B  P62  BNIP3  NIX  OPTN  NDP52  Cyp D LAMP1  and LAMP2) and protein levels of LC3II/LC3I  BNIP3  and NIX  downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of P62; reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)  ATP content  mitochondrial respiratory control rate (RCR)  mitochondrial respiratory control rate (OPR)  and the mRNA and protein levels of PGC-1α  TOMM20  and Mfn2  but increased the mRNA and protein levels of Drp1. Besides  cotreatment with Cu and CsA dramatically decreased the level of mitophagy  but increased mitochondrial division  further reduced MMP  ATP content  RCR  and OPR  mitochondrial fusion and thereby reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together  these data indicated that Cu exposure induced BNIP3/NIX-dependent mitophagy in duck renal tubular epithelial cells  and inhibition of mitophagy aggravated Cu-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.,Autophagy_notLIR
Ruthenium Complexes as Promising Candidates against Lung Cancer.Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies with the highest mortality rate and the second-highest incidence rate after breast cancer  posing a serious threat to human health. The accidental discovery of the antitumor properties of cisplatin in the early 1960s aroused a growing interest in metal-based compounds for cancer treatment. However  the clinical application of cisplatin is limited by serious side effects and drug resistance. Therefore  other transition metal complexes have been developed for the treatment of different malignant cancers. Among them  Ru(II/III)-based complexes have emerged as promising anticancer drug candidates due to their potential anticancer properties and selective cytotoxic activity. In this review  we summarized the latest developments of Ru(II/III) complexes against lung cancer  focusing mainly on the mechanisms of their biological activities  including induction of apoptosis  necroptosis  autophagy  cell cycle arrest  inhibition of cell proliferation  and invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR

The Interplay between Autophagy and Virus Pathogenesis-The Significance of Autophagy in Viral Hepatitis and Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers.Autophagy is a process focused on maintaining the homeostasis of organisms; nevertheless  the role of this process has also been widely documented in viral infections. Thus  xenophagy is a selective form of autophagy targeting viruses. However  the relation between autophagy and viruses is ambiguous-this process may be used as a strategy to fight with a virus  but is also in favor of the virus's replication. In this paper  we have gathered data on autophagy in viral hepatitis and viral hemorrhagic fevers and the relations impacting its viral pathogenesis. Thus  autophagy is a potential therapeutic target  but research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which the virus interacts with the autophagic machinery. These studies must be performed in specific research models other than the natural host for many reasons. In this paper  we also indicate <i>Lagovirus europaeus</i> virus as a potentially good research model for acute liver failure and viral hemorrhagic disease.,Autophagy_notLIR
Epigenetic regulation and autophagy modulation debilitates insulin resistance associated Alzheimer's disease condition in rats.Insulin resistance (IR) and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers are potential causative factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Simultaneously  enhanced clearance level of these oligomers through autophagy activation bring novel insights into their therapeutic paradigm. Autophagy activation is negatively correlated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and dysregulated mTOR level due to epigenetic alterations can further culminate towards AD pathogenesis. Therefore  in the current study we explored the neuroprotective efficacy of rapamycin (rapa) and vorinostat (vori) in-vitro and in-vivo. Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to rapa (20 μM) and vori (4 μM) to analyse mRNA expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP)  brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)  neuronal growth factor (NGF)  beclin-1  microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3)  lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2). In order to develop IR condition  rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and then subjected to intracerebroventricular Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> administration. Subsequently  their treatment was initiated with rapa (1 mg/kg  i.p.) and vori (50 mg/kg  i.p.) once daily for 28 days. Morris water maze was performed to govern cognitive impairment followed by sacrification for subsequent mRNA  biochemical  western blot and histological estimations. For all the measured parameters  a significant improvement was observed amongst the combination treatment group in contrast to that of the HFD + Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> group and that of the groups treated with the drugs alone. Outcomes of the present study thus suggest that combination therapy with rapa and vori provide a prospective therapeutic approach to ameliorate AD symptoms exacerbated by IR.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Neuroprotective treatment of idiopathic  genetic and atypical Parkinson's disease with alpha-synuclein-Pathology].The key aspect of the classification of neurodegenerative diseases is the histopathological detection of certain proteins in the brain. The various disease entities are distinguished with respect to the type of detected protein and with respect to the configuration and localization of the corresponding protein aggregates. Aggregates of alpha-synuclein (ASYN) are the defining hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies. The most well-known diseases in this spectrum are Parkinson's disease (PD) with neuronal detection of Lewy bodies  dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)  with additional detection of beta-amyloid and multiple system atrophy (MSA)  where ASYN aggregates are found in glia cells in the form of Papp-Lantos inclusions. ASYN has been identified as a key target for the development of therapeutic approaches to synucleinopathies given its central role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Current treatment strategies can be roughly classified into six groups: 1) lowering ASYN expression (antisense therapy)  2) inhibition of formation of toxic ASYN aggregates (aggregation inhibitors  chelators)  3) dissolving or removal of intracellular or extracellular toxic AYSN aggregates (active and passive immunotherapy  aggregation inhibitors)  4) enhancement of cellular clearance mechanisms (autophagy  lysosomal microphagy) for removal of toxic forms of alpha-synuclein  5) modulation of neuroinflammatory processes and 6) neuroprotective strategies. This article summarizes the current therapeutic approaches and sheds light on promising future treatment approaches.,Autophagy_notLIR
Sodium metabisulfite as a cytotoxic food additive induces apoptosis in HFFF2 cells.Sodium metabisulfite (SMB)  an antioxidant agent  is extensively used as a preservative in food industry. The current study was aimed to clarify its potential toxic effects on human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFF2) cells  in vitro. Subsequently  MTT results illustrated that exposure to SMB significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased HFFF2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner  and the concentration of 25 μM reduced cell survival rates to 50% as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of SMB. It was further shown that SMB exerted this cytotoxic effect on HFFF2 cells through apoptosis induction. qRT-PCR and western blotting results showed that treatment of HFFF2 cells with this food additive led to significant upregulation of Bax  caspase 8  and caspase 9 pro-apoptotic genes and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression as a pro-survival agent. Furthermore  SMB remarkably increased caspase 3 levels and promoted its activation through cleavage in treated cells. Besides  exposure to SMB increased ROS levels and activated autophagy in treated cells  which are considered as the other indicators for cell damage. Taken together  our findings suggested that SMB could exert remarkable toxic effects on human normal cells through multiple mechanisms  including apoptosis activation  and its widespread usage in food safety should be reconsidered.,Autophagy_notLIR
MiR-155 promotes cadmium-induced autophagy in rat hepatocytes by suppressing Rheb expression.Cadmium is an environmental pollutant that threatens the health of both humans and animals. Current studies have shown that while hepatotoxic damage induced by cadmium is closely related to autophagy  its intrinsic mechanism has not been elucidated. MicroRNA plays a regulatory role on different stages of autophagy. In this study  we investigated the mechanisms by which microRNA-155 (miR-155) regulate cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity in rat hepatocytes (BRL 3A cells) and in vivo. We found that cadmium exposure could cause liver injury in rats  resulting in a decreased liver index  increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity  hepatocyte steatosis  and ultrastructure damage. Cadmium exposure also induced autophagy in hepatocytes  resulting in increased expression of ATG5  Belin1  LC3II  and an increased number of autophagosomes. In addition  cadmium exposure upregulated miR-155 expression  downregulated Rheb mRNA expression  and downregulated the level of protein expression in the Rheb/mTOR signaling pathway in rat hepatocytes. The overexpression of miR-155 followed by cadmium exposure upregulated the level of autophagy in BRL3A cells  whereas miR-155 inhibition had the opposite effect. In addition  miR-155 negatively regulated Rheb. A dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the negative regulatory effect of miR-155 on Rheb targeting. Knockdown of Rheb downregulated cadmium-induced autophagy. Therefore  the Rheb/mTOR signaling can negatively regulate autophagy. The present study demonstrates that miR-155 promotes cadmium-induced autophagy in rat hepatocytes by suppressing Rheb expression.,Autophagy_notLIR

Regulatory roles of phytochemicals on circular RNAs in cancer and other chronic diseases.As novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)  circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases  and the regulation of these functional molecules has become a research hotspot gradually. Within the past decade  phytochemicals were reported to regulate the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in various chronic diseases  and more recently  most studies focus on the regulatory roles of phytochemicals on circRNAs. Abnormal expression of circRNAs has been identified in chronic diseases like cancer  heart failure  depression and atherosclerosis  and numerous studies have revealed the modulation of circRNAs by phytochemicals including berberine  celastrol  cinnamaldehyde  curcumin  et al. The expression of circRNAs  such as circSATB2 and circFOXM1  were modulated by phytochemicals  and these regulations further affected cell proliferation  apoptosis  migration  invasion  autophagy  chemosensitivity  radiosensitivity and other biological processes. Mechanismly  the circRNAs mainly functioned as miRNA sponge  subsequently affecting miRNA-mediated regulation of target genes and related cell signaling pathways. In this review  we summarized the impact of phytochemicals on circRNAs expression and biological function  and discussed the mechanisms underlying phytochemicals regulating circRNAs in cancer and other chronic diseases.,Autophagy_notLIR
Focus on the Small GTPase Rab1: A Key Player in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of large aggregates in the survival neurons called Lewy bodies  which mainly contain α-synuclein (α-syn). The cause of cell death is not known but could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction  protein homeostasis failure  and alterations in the secretory/endolysosomal/autophagic pathways. Survival nigral neurons overexpress the small GTPase Rab1. This protein is considered a housekeeping Rab that is necessary to support the secretory pathway  the maintenance of the Golgi complex structure  and the regulation of macroautophagy from yeast to humans. It is also involved in signaling  carcinogenesis  and infection for some pathogens. It has been shown that it is directly linked to the pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. It has a protective effect against α-σψν toxicity and has recently been shown to be a substrate of LRRK2  which is the most common cause of familial PD and the risk of sporadic disease. In this review  we analyze the key aspects of Rab1 function in dopamine neurons and its implications in PD neurodegeneration/restauration. The results of the current and former research support the notion that this GTPase is a good candidate for therapeutic strategies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Characterisation of autophagy disruption in the ileum of pigs infected with Lawsonia intracellularis.Lawsonia intracellularis is the aetiological agent of proliferative enteropathy  an enteric disease endemic in swine. Survival in its intracellular niche of the ileum epithelial lining requires the capacity to subvert  repress or exploit the host immune response to create an environment conducive to bacterial propagation. To better understand how L. intracellularis survives in its intracellular niche  we have performed an investigation into the dynamic relationship between infection and the host autophagy response by immunohistochemistry in experimentally infected porcine ileum samples.Beclin1  a protein required early in the autophagy pathway was observed to be distributed with a basal to apical concentration gradient in the crypts of healthy piglets  whilst infected piglets were observed to have no gradient of distribution and an increase in the presence of Beclin1 in crypts with histological characteristics of L. intracellularis residence. Detecting microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is used as a method for monitoring autophagy progression as it associates with mature autophagosomes. For LC3 there was no notable change in signal intensity between crypts with characteristic L. intracellularis infection and healthy crypts of uninfected pigs. Finally  as p62 is degraded with the internal substrate of an autophagosome it was used to measure autophagic flux. There was no observed reduction or redistribution of p62.These preliminary results of the autophagy response in the ileum suggest that L. intracellularis affects autophagy. This disruption to host ileum homeostasis may provide a mechanism that assists in bacterial propagation and contributes to pathogenesis.,Autophagy_notLIR
Association of miR-192-5p with Atherosclerosis and its Effect on Proliferation and Migration of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.To evaluate the diagnostic significance of serum miR-192-5p for atherosclerosis (AS) and explore the effect of miR-192-5p on cell proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The expression level of serum miR-192-5p was measured by qRT-PCR. Correlations of miR-192-5p with CRP and CIMT were evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficient. The diagnostic significance of miR-192-5p was assessed using an ROC curve. CCK-8 assay and Transwell assay were used to analyze the effect of miR-192-5p on cell proliferation and migration. Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to evaluate the effect of miR-192-5p with ATG7. The expression level of serum miR-192-5p in AS patients was significantly high compared with healthy controls. miR-192-5p was positively correlated with CRP and CIMT  and it has diagnostic value for AS. In vitro cell experiments confirmed that overexpression of miR-192-5p could promote cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs. miR-192-5p directly targets ATG7 in VSMCs. Down-regulation of miR-192-5p level increased ATG7 expression and inhibited cell proliferation and migration. miR-192-5p may be a new biomarker for the diagnosis of AS and may provide new idea for the treatment of AS.,Autophagy_notLIR
SlMYB72 affects pollen development by regulating autophagy in tomato.The formation and development of pollen are among the most critical processes for reproduction and genetic diversity in the life cycle of flowering plants. The present study found that <i>SlMYB72</i> was highly expressed in the pollen and tapetum of tomato flowers. Downregulation of <i>SlMYB72</i> led to a decrease in the amounts of seeds due to abnormal pollen development compared with wild-type plants. Downregulation of <i>SlMYB72</i> delayed tapetum degradation and inhibited autophagy in tomato anther. Overexpression of <i>SlMYB72</i> led to abnormal pollen development and delayed tapetum degradation. Expression levels of some autophagy-related genes (ATGs) were decreased in <i>SlMYB72</i> downregulated plants and increased in overexpression plants. SlMYB72 was directly bound to ACCAAC/ACCAAA motif of the <i>SlATG7</i> promoter and activated its expression. Downregulation of <i>SlATG7</i> inhibited the autophagy process and tapetum degradation  resulting in abnormal pollen development in tomatoes. These results indicated SlMYB72 affects the tapetum degradation and pollen development by transcriptional activation of <i>SlATG7</i> and autophagy in tomato anther. The study expands the understanding of the regulation of autophagy by SlMYB72  uncovers the critical role that autophagy plays in pollen development  and provides potential candidate genes for the production of male-sterility in plants.,Autophagy_notLIR
Methionine enkephalin activates autophagy and stimulates tumour cell immunogenicity in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a common skin tumour. Due to weak immunogenicity  recurrence is frequent after treatment. In this study  we explored the effects and mechanisms of methionine enkephalin (MENK)  an endogenous opioid peptide and negative growth regulator  in CSCC. MENK inhibited A431 cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis through the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). Importantly  MENK also induced autophagy in CSCC and stimulated the emission of DAMPs in A431 cells  which resulted in enhanced activation of dendritic cells (DC).In conclusion  MENK provides an effective method with therapeutic potential to modulate the CSCC microenvironment by utilizing autophagy in the cancer cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
Neuropathology of Multiple System Atrophy  a Glioneuronal Degenerative Disease.Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal disease characterized pathologically by the widespread occurrence of aggregated α-synuclein in the oligodendrocytes referred to as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). α-Synuclein aggregates are also found in the oligodendroglial nuclei and neuronal cytoplasm and nuclei. It is uncertain whether the primary source of α-synuclein in GCIs is originated from neurons or oligodendrocytes. Accumulating evidence suggests that there are two degenerative processes in this disease. One possibility is that numerous GCIs are associated with the impairment of oligo-myelin-axon-neuron complex  and the other is that neuronal inclusion pathology is also a primary event from the early stage. Both oligodendrocytes and neurons may be primarily affected in MSA  and the damage of one cell type contributes to the degeneration of the other. Vesicle-mediated transport plays a key role in the nuclear translocation of α-synuclein as well as in the formation of glial and neuronal α-synuclein inclusions. Recent studies have shown that impairment of autophagy can occur along with or as a result of α-synuclein accumulation in the brain of MSA and Lewy body disease. Activated autophagy may be implicated in the therapeutic approach for α-synucleinopathies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Circular RNA-regulated autophagy is involved in cancer progression.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a sort of long  non-coding RNA molecules with a covalently closed continuous ring structure without 5'-3' polarity and poly-A tail. The modulative role of circRNAs in malignant diseases has been elucidated by many studies in recent years <i>via</i> bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Generally  circRNA affects the proliferative  invasive  and migrative capacity of malignant cells <i>via</i> various mechanisms  exhibiting great potential as novel biomarkers in the diagnoses or treatments of malignancies. Meanwhile  autophagy preserves cellular homeostasis  serving as a vital molecular process in tumor progression. Mounting studies have demonstrated that autophagy can not only contribute to cancer cell survival but can also induce autophagic cell death in specific conditions. A growing number of research studies have indicated that there existed abundant associations between circRNAs and autophagy. Herein  we systemically reviewed and discussed recent studies on this topic in different malignancies and concluded that the circRNA-autophagy axis played crucial roles in the proliferation  metastasis  invasion  and drug or radiation resistance of different tumor cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
A Promising Intracellular Protein-Degradation Strategy: TRIMbody-Away Technique Based on Nanobody Fragment.Most recently  a technology termed TRIM-Away has allowed acute and rapid destruction of endogenous target proteins in cultured cells using specific antibodies and endogenous/exogenous tripartite motif 21 (TRIM21). However  the relatively large size of the full-size mAbs (150 kDa) results in correspondingly low tissue penetration and inaccessibility of some sterically hindered epitopes  which limits the target protein degradation. In addition  exogenous introduction of TRIM21 may cause side effects for treated cells. To tackle these limitations  we sought to replace full-size mAbs with the smaller format of antibodies  a nanobody (VHH  15 kDa)  and construct a new type of fusion protein named TRIMbody by fusing the nanobody and RBCC motif of TRIM21. Next  we introduced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a model substrate and generated αEGFP TRIMbody using a bispecific anti-EGFP (αEGFP) nanobody. Remarkably  inducible expression of αEGFP TRIMbody could specifically degrade intracellular EGFP in HEK293T cells in a time-dependent manner. By treating cells with inhibitors  we found that intracellular EGFP degradation by αEGFP TRIMbody relies on both ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. Taken together  these results suggested that TRIMbody-Away technology could be utilized to specifically degrade intracellular protein and could expand the potential applications of degrader technologies.,Autophagy_notLIR
Dihydromyricetin ameliorates social isolation-induced anxiety by modulating mitochondrial function  antioxidant enzymes  and BDNF.Stress has been implicated in the etiology of neurological and psychological illnesses. Chronic social isolation (SI) is a psychological stressor that provokes neurobehavioral changes associated with psychiatric disorders  including anxiety disorders. Mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress are hallmarks of anxiety pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the effects of SI-induced stress on mitochondrial function  antioxidative enzymes  autophagy  and brain derivative neurotrophic factor (BDNF). SI induced a reduction in electron transport chain subunits C-I  C-II  and C-VI and an increase in hydrogen peroxide. Treatment with dihydromyricetin (DHM)  extracted from <i>Ampelopsis grossedentata</i>  counteracted these changes. A dramatic increase in several primary mitochondrial antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)  heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)  peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3)  and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was observed after SI and a repeated episode of SI. Both SI and repeated SI induced a reduction in sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62). However  only repeated SI modulated autophagy primary protein beclin-1 (Bcl-1). In addition  SI and repeated SI modulated the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of the downstream extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase1/2 (p-Erk p42 and p-Erk p44) cascade. DHM treatment ameliorated these changes. Collectively  we demonstrated that DHM treatment counteracted the effects of SI and repeated SI on antioxidative enzymes  autophagy  and the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms that partially explain the anxiolytic effects of DHM.,Autophagy_notLIR
The phosphorylation of AMPKβ1 is critical for increasing autophagy and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in response to fatty acids.Fatty acids are vital for the survival of eukaryotes  but when present in excess can have deleterious consequences. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important regulator of multiple branches of metabolism. Studies in purified enzyme preparations and cultured cells have shown that AMPK is allosterically activated by small molecules as well as fatty acyl-CoAs through a mechanism involving Ser108 within the regulatory AMPK β1 isoform. However  the in vivo physiological significance of this residue has not been evaluated. In the current study  we generated mice with a targeted germline knock-in (KI) mutation of AMPKβ1 Ser108 to Ala (S108A-KI)  which renders the site phospho-deficient. S108A-KI mice had reduced AMPK activity (50 to 75%) in the liver but not in the skeletal muscle. On a chow diet  S108A-KI mice had impairments in exogenous lipid-induced fatty acid oxidation. Studies in mice fed a high-fat diet found that S108A-KI mice had a tendency for greater glucose intolerance and elevated liver triglycerides. Consistent with increased liver triglycerides  livers of S108A-KI mice had reductions in mitochondrial content and respiration that were accompanied by enlarged mitochondria  suggestive of impairments in mitophagy. Subsequent studies in primary hepatocytes found that S108A-KI mice had reductions in palmitate- stimulated Cpt1a and Ppargc1a mRNA  ULK1 phosphorylation and autophagic/mitophagic flux. These data demonstrate an important physiological role of AMPKβ1 Ser108 phosphorylation in promoting fatty acid oxidation  mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy under conditions of high lipid availability. As both ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting increase circulating free fatty acid levels  AMPK activity  mitochondrial biogenesis  and mitophagy  these data suggest a potential unifying mechanism which may be important in mediating these effects.,Autophagy_notLIR
Pexophagy is critical for fungal development  stress response  and virulence in Alternaria alternata.Alternaria alternata can resist high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The protective roles of autophagy or autophagy-mediated degradation of peroxisomes (termed pexophagy) against oxidative stress remain unclear. The present study  using transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy coupled with a GFP-AaAtg8 proteolysis assay and an mCherry tagging assay with peroxisomal targeting tripeptides  demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and nitrogen depletion induced autophagy and pexophagy. Experimental evidence showed that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> triggered autophagy and the translocation of peroxisomes into the vacuoles. Mutational inactivation of the AaAtg8 gene in A. alternata led to autophagy impairment  resulting in the accumulation of peroxisomes  increased ROS sensitivity  and decreased virulence. Compared to the wild type  ΔAaAtg8 failed to detoxify ROS effectively  leading to ROS accumulation. Deleting AaAtg8 down-regulated the expression of genes encoding an NADPH oxidase and a Yap1 transcription factor  both involved in ROS resistance. Deleting AaAtg8 affected the development of conidia and appressorium-like structures. Deleting AaAtg8 also compromised the integrity of the cell wall. Reintroduction of a functional copy of AaAtg8 in the mutant completely restored all defective phenotypes. Although ΔAaAtg8 produced wild-type toxin levels in axenic culture  the mutant induced a lower level of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and smaller necrotic lesions on citrus leaves. In addition to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>   nitrogen starvation triggered peroxisome turnover. We concluded that ΔAaAtg8 failed to degrade peroxisomes effectively  leading to the accumulation of peroxisomes and the reduction of the stress response. Autophagy-mediated peroxisome turnover could increase cell adaptability and survival under oxidative stress and starvation conditions.,Autophagy_notLIR
A linear five-ring pyrrole-imidazole polyamide-triphenylphosphonium conjugate targeting a mitochondrial DNA mutation efficiently induces apoptosis of HeLa cybrid cells carrying the mutation.Somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA may provide a new avenue for cancer therapy due to their associations to a number of cancers and a tendency of homoplasmicity. In consideration of mitochondrial features and its relatively small genome size  a nucleotide-based targeting approach is a considerably more promising option. To explore the efficacy of short linear N-methylpyrrole-N-methylimidazole polyamide (PI polyamide)  we synthesized a five-ring short PI polyamide that provided sequence-specific homing for the A3243G mitochondrial mutation upon conjugation with triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP). This PI polyamide-TPP was able to induce cytotoxicity in HeLamtA3243G cybrid cells  while preserving preferential binding for oligonucleotides containing the A3243G motif from melting temperature assays. The PI polyamide-TPP also localized in the mitochondria in HeLamtA3243G cells and induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production  mitophagy and apoptosis in a mutation-specific fashion compared to the wild-type HeLamtHeLa cybrids; normal human dermal fibroblasts were also relatively unaffected to suggest discriminating selectivity for the mutant mitochondria  offering a novel outlook for cancer therapy via mitochondrial homing of short linear PIP-TPPs.,Autophagy_notLIR
BcMettl4-Mediated DNA Adenine N<sup>6</sup>-Methylation Is Critical for Virulence of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>.DNA adenine N<sup>6</sup>-methylation (6mA) plays a critical role in various biological functions  but its occurrence and functions in filamentous plant pathogens are largely unexplored. <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> is an important pathogenic fungus worldwide. A systematic analysis of 6mA in <i>B. cinerea</i> was performed in this study  revealing that 6mA is widely distributed in the genome of this fungus. The 2 kb regions flanking many genes  particularly the upstream promoter regions  were susceptible to methylation. The role of BcMettl4  a 6mA methyltransferase  in the virulence of <i>B. cinerea</i> was investigated. <i>BcMETTL4</i> disruption and point mutations of its catalytic motif "DPPW" both resulted in significant 6mA reduction in the genomic DNA and in reduced virulence of <i>B. cinerea</i>. RNA-Seq analysis revealed a total of 13 downregulated genes in the disruption mutant ΔBcMettl4 in which methylation occurred at the promoter sites. These were involved in oxidoreduction  secretory pathways  autophagy and carbohydrate metabolism. Two of these genes  <i>BcFDH</i> and <i>BcMFS2</i>  were independently disrupted. Knockout of <i>BcFDH</i> led to reduced sclerotium formation  while disruption of <i>BcMFS2</i> resulted in dramatically decreased conidium formation and pathogenicity. These observations indicated that 6mA provides potential epigenetic markers in <i>B. cinerea</i> and that BcMettl4 regulates virulence in this important plant pathogen.,Autophagy_notLIR
[Dexmedetomidine alleviates LPS/D-Gal-induced acute liver injury via up-regulation of LC3-II expression in mice].The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on acute liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-Gal) and the underlying mechanism. Male BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS/D-Gal to induce acute liver injury model  and pretreated with DEX or in combination with the autophagy inhibitor  3-methyladenine (3-MA) 30 min before injection. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity  as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in liver tissue were determined with the corresponding kits. Serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined by ELISA. The protein expression levels of LC3-II and P62 in liver tissue were determined by Western blot. Liver histopathological changes were detected by HE staining. The results showed that  compared with control group  LPS/D-Gal enhanced ALT and AST activity  increased TNF-α and IL-6 levels  as well as MPO activity  up-regulated LC3-II and P62 protein expression levels  and significantly induced pathological damage in liver tissue. DEX reversed the above changes in the LPS/D-Gal group  whereas these protective effects of DEX were blocked by 3-MA. The above results suggest that DEX alleviates LPS/D-Gal-induced acute liver injury  which may be associated with the up-regulation of LC3-II protein expression and the activation of autophagy.,Autophagy_notLIR

Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Ameliorates 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1 2 3 6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) Neurotoxicity Through Enhancing Mitophagy Flux and Reducing α-Synuclein and Oxidative Stress.Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease without known disease modification therapy to slow down disease progression. This disease has pathological features of Lewy bodies with α-synuclein aggregation being the major component and selective dopaminergic neuronal loss over the substantia nigra. Although the exact etiology is still unknown  mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be central in PD pathophysiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been connected to PD  and anti-diabetic drugs  such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs)  have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in PD animal models. The GLP-1RA liraglutide is currently under a phase 2 clinical trial to measure its effect on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. In this study  we used an acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 2 3 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD to test the possible mechanism of the GLP-1RA liraglutide in the pathogenesis of PD. We show that the neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction caused by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor  MPTP  can be partially reversed by liraglutide. The GLP-1RA can protect mice from apoptosis of substantia nigra neurons induced by MPTP. MPTP treatment led to imbalanced mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics  altered mitochondrial morphology  impeded autophagy flux  increased α-synuclein accumulation  and elevated oxidative stress. Specifically  the normalizing of mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamic-related proteins and enhancement of autophagy flux after administration of liraglutide is associated with improving neuronal survival. This suggests that GLP-1RAs may provide potential beneficial effects for PD caused by mitochondrial dysfunction through improvement of mitochondrial morphology balance and enhancing damaged organelle degradation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Cdk8 Kinase Module: A Mediator of Life and Death Decisions in Times of Stress.The Cdk8 kinase module (CKM) of the multi-subunit mediator complex plays an essential role in cell fate decisions in response to different environmental cues. In the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>  the CKM consists of four conserved subunits (cyclin C and its cognate cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk8  Med13  and Med12) and predominantly negatively regulates a subset of stress responsive genes (SRG's). Derepression of these SRG's is accomplished by disassociating the CKM from the mediator  thus allowing RNA polymerase II-directed transcription. In response to cell death stimuli  cyclin C translocates to the mitochondria where it induces mitochondrial hyper-fission and promotes regulated cell death (RCD). The nuclear release of cyclin C requires Med13 destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In contrast  to protect the cell from RCD following SRG induction induced by nutrient deprivation  cyclin C is rapidly destroyed by the UPS before it reaches the cytoplasm. This enables a survival response by two mechanisms: increased ATP production by retaining reticular mitochondrial morphology and relieving CKM-mediated repression on autophagy genes. Intriguingly  nitrogen starvation also stimulates Med13 destruction but through a different mechanism. Rather than destruction via the UPS  Med13 proteolysis occurs in the vacuole (yeast lysosome) via a newly identified Snx4-assisted autophagy pathway. Taken together  these findings reveal that the CKM regulates cell fate decisions by both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms  placing it at a convergence point between cell death and cell survival pathways.,Autophagy_notLIR
Novel Intronic Mutation in <i>VMA21</i> Causing Severe Phenotype of X-Linked Myopathy with Excessive Autophagy-Case Report.X-linked Myopathy with Excessive Autophagy (XMEA) is a rare autophagic vacuolar myopathy caused by mutations in the Vacuolar ATPase assembly factor <i>VMA21</i> gene; onset usually occurs during childhood and rarely occurs during adulthood. We described a 22-year-old patient with XMEA  whose onset was declared at 11 through gait disorder. He had severe four-limb proximal weakness and amyotrophy  and his proximal muscle MRC score was between 2 and 3/5 in four limbs; creatine kinase levels were elevated (1385 IU/L)  and electroneuromyography and muscle MRI were suggestive of myopathy. Muscle biopsy showed abnormalities typical of autophagic vacuolar myopathy. We detected a hemizygous  unreported  intronic  single-nucleotide substitution c.164-20T>A (NM_001017980.4) in intron 2 of the <i>VMA21</i> gene. Fibroblasts derived from this patient displayed a reduced level of <i>VMA21</i> transcripts (at 40% of normal) and protein  suggesting a pathogenicity related to an alteration of the splicing efficiency associated with an intron retention. This patient with XMEA displayed a severe phenotype (rapid weakness of upper and lower limbs) due to a new intronic variant of <i>VMA21</i>  related to an alteration in the splicing efficiency associated with intron retention  suggesting that phenotype severity is closely related to the residual expression of the VMA21 protein.,Autophagy_notLIR
New Look of EBV LMP1 Signaling Landscape.The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) principal oncoprotein Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) is a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) superfamily with constitutive activity. LMP1 shares many features with Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs)  including the use of TRAFs  adaptors  and kinase cascades  for signal transduction leading to the activation of NFκB  AP1  and Akt  as well as a subset of IRFs and likely the master antioxidative transcription factor NRF2  which we have gradually added to the list. In recent years  we have discovered the Linear UBiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC)  the adaptor protein LIMD1  and the ubiquitin sensor and signaling hub p62  as novel components of LMP1 signalosome. Functionally  LMP1 is a pleiotropic factor that reprograms  balances  and perturbs a large spectrum of cellular mechanisms  including the ubiquitin machinery  metabolism  epigenetics  DNA damage response  extracellular vehicles  immune defenses  and telomere elongation  to promote oncogenic transformation  cell proliferation and survival  anchorage-independent cell growth  angiogenesis  and metastasis and invasion  as well as the development of the tumor microenvironment. We have recently shown that LMP1 induces p62-mediated selective autophagy in EBV latency  at least by contributing to the induction of p62 expression  and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. We have also been collecting evidence supporting the hypothesis that LMP1 activates the Keap1-NRF2 pathway  which serves as the key antioxidative defense mechanism. Last but not least  our preliminary data shows that LMP1 is associated with the deregulation of cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway in EBV latency. A comprehensive understanding of the LMP1 signaling landscape is essential for identifying potential targets for the development of novel strategies towards targeted therapeutic applications.,Autophagy_notLIR
Annexin A2 regulates unfolded protein response via IRE1-XBP1 axis in macrophages during P. aeruginosa infection.Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a severe Gram-negative opportunistic bacterium that causes a spectrum of organ system diseases  particularly in immunocompromised patients. This bacterium has been shown to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) during mammalian infection. Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is a multicompartmental protein relating to a number of cellular processes; however  it remains unknown whether AnxA2 coordinates a UPR pathway under bacterial infection conditions. Here  we report that the endoplasmic reticulum stress inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway was up-regulated by AnxA2 through p38 MAPK signaling following P. aeruginosa infection in macrophages  whereas ATF4 and ATF6 not. In addition  XBP1 was found as a positive regulator of innate immunity to tame P. aeruginosa challenges by enhancing autophagy and bacterial clearance. XBP1 also facilitated NF-κB activation to elicit the release of proinflammatory cytokines predominantly in macrophages. Together  our findings identify AnxA2 as a regulator for XBP1-mediated UPR pathway.,Autophagy_notLIR
Chrysosplenol D Triggers Apoptosis through Heme Oxygenase-1 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.Chrysosplenol D  a flavonol isolated from <i>Artemisia annua</i> L.  can exert anticancer effects. This study investigated the anticancer property of chrysosplenol D and its underlying mechanism in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We observed that chrysosplenol D reduced cell viability and caused cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. The findings of annexin V/propidium iodide staining  chromatin condensation  and apoptotic-related protein expression revealed that chrysosplenol D regulated apoptosis in OSCC. Furthermore  chrysosplenol D altered the expression of the autophagy marker LC3 and other autophagy-related proteins. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B  extracellular signal-regulated kinase  c-Jun N-terminal kinase  and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were downregulated by chrysosplenol D  and the inhibition of these pathways significantly enhanced chrysosplenol D-induced cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Moreover  the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was found to be critical for chrysosplenol D-induced apoptotic cell death. The analysis of clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets revealed that patients with head and neck cancer had lower HO-1 expression than did those with no head and neck cancer. The findings of the present study indicated that chrysosplenol D exerts anticancer effects on OSCC by suppressing the MAPK pathway and activating HO-1 expression.,Autophagy_notLIR

Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus Upregulates STING to Activate ATF6-Mediated Autophagy.Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infection leads to autophagy  and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unclear. Here  we demonstrate that PPRV infection results in morphological changes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) of the ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR). Knockdown of ATF6 blocked the autophagy process  suggesting ATF6 is necessary for PPRV-mediated autophagy induction. Further study showed that PPRV infection upregulates expression of the ER-anchored adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING)  which is well-known for its pivotal roles in restricting DNA viruses. Knockdown of STING suppressed ATF6 activation and autophagy induction  implying that STING functions upstream of ATF6 to induce autophagy. Moreover  the STING-mediated autophagy response originated from the cellular pattern recognition receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). The absence of MDA5 abolished the upregulation of STING and the activation of autophagy. The deficiency of autophagy-related genes (ATG) repressed the autophagy process and PPRV replication  while it had no effect on MDA5 or STING expression. Overall  our work revealed that MDA5 works upstream of STING to activate ATF6 to induce autophagy. <b>IMPORTANCE</b>PPRV infection induces cellular autophagy; however  the intracellular responses and signaling mechanisms that occur upon PPRV infection are obscure  and whether innate immune responses are linked with autophagy to regulate viral replication is largely unknown. Here  we uncovered that the innate immune sensor MDA5 initiated the signaling cascade by upregulating STING  which is best known for its role in anti-DNA virus infection by inducing interferon expression. We first provide evidence that STING regulates PPRV replication by activating the ATF6 pathway of unfolded protein responses (UPRs) to induce autophagy. Our results revealed that in addition to mediating responses to foreign DNA  STING can cross talk with MDA5 to regulate the cellular stress response and autophagy induced by RNA viruses; thus  STING works as an adaptor protein for cellular stress responses and innate immune responses. Modulation of STING represents a promising approach to control both DNA and RNA viruses.,Autophagy_notLIR
Puerarin Alleviates LPS-Induced H9C2 Cell Injury by Inducing Mitochondrial Autophagy.Sepsis leads to the damage of multiple organs  and thereby adversely affects the cardiovascular system. At present  no effective method has been found to treat myocardial injury caused by sepsis. Although Puerarin was reported to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mitochondrial injury in H9C2 cells  the effects of Puerarin in sepsis-induced myocardial injury remain unclear. In this study  H9C2 cells were stimulated with LPS  CCK-8 assays were performed to assess cell viability  and flow cytometry and TUNEL staining were used to assess cell apoptosis. Levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)  adenosine diphosphate (ADP)  adenosine monophosphate (AMP)  and enzyme activity were investigated using commercial kits. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in H9C2 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Autophagosomes in the mitochondria of H9C2 cells were observed by transmission electron microscope  and protein expression was assessed by western blotting. Furthermore  in vivo experiments were applied to test the function of Puerarin in sepsis. We found that Puerarin significantly reversed LPS-induced decreases in H9C2 cell viability by inhibiting apoptosis. The ROS levels in H9C2 cells were significantly upregulated by LPS  but that effect was markedly reduced by Puerarin. In addition  Puerarin attenuated LPS-induced mitochondrial injury in H9C2 cells by regulating dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitofusin 1 (MFN1). LPS decreased enzyme activity and reduced the levels of ADP  ALP  and AMP in mitochondria; however  those effects were reversed by Puerarin. Puerarin and Torin1 reversed LPS-induced inhibition of autophagy in the mitochondria of H9C2 cells via mediation of p62  LC3B  Pink1  and Parkin. Puerarin notably inhibited the progression of sepsis in vivo . Puerarin inhibited LPS-induced H9C2 cell injury by inducing mitochondrial autophagy  which acts as a mechanism for preventing myocardial injury caused by sepsis.,Autophagy_notLIR

Long non-coding RNA SNHG8 promotes autophagy as a ceRNA to upregulate ATG7 by sponging microRNA-588 in colorectal cancer.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) acts as an oncogene in different types of cancer  including prostate  breast and ovarian cancer. SNHG8 promotes the tumorigenesis of CRC; however  its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the mechanism of SNHG8 on CRC development via various assays  including western blot  pull-down  PCR and immunofluorescence assays. The results of the present study demonstrated that SNHG8 expression was substantially upregulated in primary tumor tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that SNHG8 facilitated cell proliferation and autophagy in CRC cells. Notably  the function of SNHG8 in enhancing autophagy was dependent on autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7). In addition  western blot analysis indicated that the effect of SNHG8 on autophagy in CRC cells was dependent on the miR-588/ATG7 axis. Taken together  the results of the present study suggest that SNHG8 promotes autophagy in CRC cells.,Autophagy_notLIR
A011  a novel small-molecule ligand of σ<sub>2</sub> receptor  potently suppresses breast cancer progression via endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer to become the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Sigma-2 (σ<sub>2</sub>) receptor is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer because of its high expression in breast cancer cells and low expression in normal breast cells. Many σ<sub>2</sub> ligands have been reported to have excellent anticancer activity  but their mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. We discovered that A011 had high affinity and selectivity for σ<sub>2</sub> receptor  reduced proliferation in five cancer cell lines  and significantly inhibited the monoclonal formation ability of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore  A011 rapidly increased the levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species and induced autophagy. Molecular pharmacology studies revealed that A011 induced endoplasmic reticulum stress  activated the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and inhibited the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway  leading to cell apoptosis. In an in vivo tumor model  A011 showed obvious anti-tumor activity and no significant toxicity. More importantly  our study demonstrated for the first time that endoplasmic reticulum stress is the main mechanism of anti-cancer effects for σ<sub>2</sub> ligands  at least for A011. A011 may potentially be useful as a therapeutic agent for treating breast cancer.,Autophagy_notLIR
2  2'  4  4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether induces placental toxicity via activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.2  2'  4  4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is one of the most important polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners  and epidemiological studies have shown that it can cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of placental injury in BDE-47-induced adverse pregnancy outcomes through in vivo and in vitro models. From day 0.5 to day 16.5 of pregnancy of ICR mice  BDE-47 oral doses of 0  25  50 and 100 mg/kg/day were administered. Immunohistochemical staining found that BDE-47 inhibited the expression of CD34 in mouse placenta  and ELISA results showed that BDE-47 reduced the levels of VEGF and PlGF in the serum of pregnant mice. Western blot assays found that the expression levels of VEGF-A and invasion-related factors were decreased in the placentas of BDE-47-treated group  which indicated that BDE-47 could impair placental angiogenesis. Furthermore  BDE-47 inhibited proliferation  increased apoptosis and autophagy  and activated p38 MAPK signaling pathway in mouse placental tissue. In vitro  HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0  5  10  20 μM BDE-47 for 24 h. Wound healing assays and Transwell assays showed that BDE-47 inhibited the migration and invasion ability of HTR-8/SVneo cells. We also found that BDE-47 inhibited the proliferation of HTR-8/SVneo cells and increased apoptosis and autophagy. BDE-47 activated p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HTR-8/SVneo cells  and inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HTR-8/SVneo cells restored the effects caused by BDE-47. In conclusion  BDE-47 impairs placental angiogenesis by inhibiting cell migration and invasion  and induces placental toxicity by inhibiting proliferation  increasing apoptosis and autophagy. In vitro  activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the processes of placental injury by BDE-47.,Autophagy_notLIR
STING protects against cardiac dysfunction and remodelling by blocking autophagy.Heart failure  which is characterized by cardiac remodelling  is one of the most common chronic diseases in the aged. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) acts as an indispensable molecule modulating immune response and inflammation in many diseases. However  the effects of STING on cardiomyopathy  especially cardiac remodelling are still largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate whether STING could affect cardiac remodelling and to explore the potential mechanisms.,Autophagy_notLIR
Elevated plasma levels of the appetite-stimulator ACBP/DBI in fasting and obese subjects.Eukaryotic cells release the phylogenetically ancient protein acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP  which in humans is encoded by the gene DBI  diazepam binding inhibitor) upon nutrient deprivation. Accordingly  mice that are starved for one to two days and humans that undergo voluntary fasting for one to three weeks manifest an increase in the plasma concentration of ACBP/DBI. Paradoxically  ACBP/DBI levels also increase in obese mice and humans. Since ACBP/DBI stimulates appetite  this latter finding may explain why obesity constitutes a self-perpetuating state. Here  we present a theoretical framework to embed these findings in the mechanisms of weight control  as well as a bioinformatics analysis showing that  irrespective of the human cell or tissue type  one single isoform of ACBP/DBI (ACBP1) is preponderant (~90% of all DBI transcripts  with the sole exception of the testis  where it is ~70%). Based on our knowledge  we conclude that ACBP1 is subjected to a biphasic transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation  explaining why obesity and fasting both are associated with increased circulating ACBP1 protein levels.,Autophagy_notLIR

Mitophagy alleviates ischemia/reperfusion-induced microvascular damage through improving mitochondrial quality control.The coronary arteries mainly function to perfuse the myocardium. When coronary artery resistance increases  myocardial perfusion decreases and myocardial remodeling occurs. Mitochondrial damage has been regarded as the primary cause of microvascular dysfunction. In the present study  we explored the effects of mitophagy activation on microvascular damage. Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury induced mitochondrial oxidative stress  thereby promoting mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells. Mitochondrial impairment induced apoptosis  reducing the viability and proliferation of endothelial cells. However  supplementation with the mitophagy inducer urolithin A (UA) preserved mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential in endothelial cells. UA also sustained the viability and improved the proliferative capacity of endothelial cells by suppressing apoptotic factors and upregulating cyclins D and E. In addition  UA inhibited mitochondrial fission and restored mitochondrial fusion  which reduced the proportion of fragmented mitochondria within endothelial cells. UA enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells by upregulating sirtuin 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. These results suggested that activation of mitophagy may reduce hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiac microvascular damage by improving mitochondrial quality control and increasing cell viability and proliferation.,Autophagy_notLIR
Paeonol protects renal tubular cells against cadmium-induced cytotoxicity via alleviating oxidative stress  inhibiting inflammatory responses and restoring autophagy.Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread environmental pollutant with highly toxic to kidney. Paeonol (Pae) is a natural flavonoid isolated from Moutan Cortex that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Herein  we investigated the protective effects of Pae against Cd-induced nephrotoxicity and elucidated its underlying mechanisms. First  we screened the optimum treatment conditions for Pae and confirmed its ability to protect NRK-52E cells against Cd-induced cytotoxicity. The results showed that Pae alleviated Cd-induced oxidative stress by scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species. Furthermore  Pae suppressed Cd-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB and the transcriptions of pro-inflammatory cytokines including cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β  IL-6  monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Pae alleviated Cd-induced autophagy inhibition  which was partly attributable to alleviation of oxidative stress. Meanwhile  Pae improved the structural integrity and degradation function of lysosomes  indicating that Pae can also target lysosomes to restore Cd-inhibited autophagic flux. Collectively  Pae alleviated Cd-induced renal cytotoxicity by alleviating oxidative stress  inhibiting inflammatory responses and restoring autophagy  implicating that Pae may serve as new candidate drug to treat Cd-induced nephrotoxicity.,Autophagy_notLIR
Development of nanoscale drug delivery systems of dihydroartemisinin for cancer therapy: A review.Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)  a first-line antimalarial drug  has demonstrated great anticancer effects in many types of tumors  including liver cancer  glioblastoma  and pancreatic cancer. Due to its abilities to induce programmed cell death (PCD; apoptosis  autophagy and ferroptosis)  inhibit tumor metastasis and angiogenesis  and modulate the tumor microenvironment  DHA could become an antineoplastic agent in the foreseeable future. However  the therapeutic efficacy of DHA is compromised owing to its inherent disadvantages  including poor stability  low aqueous solubility  and short plasma half-life. To overcome these drawbacks  nanoscale drug delivery systems (NDDSs)  such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs)  liposomes  and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)  have been introduced to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of DHA in either single-drug or multidrug therapy. Based on the beneficial properties of NDDSs  including enhanced stability and solubility of the drug  prolonged circulation time and selective accumulation in tumors  the outcomes of DHA-loaded NDDSs for cancer therapy are significantly improved compared to those of free DHA. This review first summarizes the current understanding of the anticancer mechanisms of DHA and then provides an overview of DHA-including nanomedicines  aiming to provide inspiration for further application of DHA as an anticancer drug.,Autophagy_notLIR
Mixotrophy in a Local Strain of Nannochloropsis granulata for Renewable High-Value Biomass Production on the West Coast of Sweden.A local strain of <i>Nannochloropsis granulata</i> (<i>Ng</i>) has been reported as the most productive microalgal strain in terms of both biomass yield and lipid content when cultivated in photobioreactors that simulate the light and temperature conditions during the summer on the west coast of Sweden. To further increase the biomass and the biotechnological potential of this strain in these conditions  mixotrophic growth (i.e.  the simultaneous use of photosynthesis and respiration) with glycerol as an external carbon source was investigated in this study and compared with phototrophic growth that made use of air enriched with 1-2% CO<sub>2</sub>. The addition of either glycerol or CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched air stimulated the growth of <i>Ng</i> and theproduction of high-value long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA) as well as the carotenoid canthaxanthin. Bioassays in human prostate cell lines indicated the highest antitumoral activity for <i>Ng</i> extracts and fractions from mixotrophic conditions. Metabolomics detected betaine lipids specifically in the bioactive fractions  suggesting their involvement in the observed antitumoral effect. Genes related to autophagy were found to be upregulated by the most bioactive fraction  suggesting a possible therapeutic target against prostate cancer progression. Taken together  our results suggest that the local <i>Ng</i> strain can be cultivated mixotrophically in summer conditions on the west coast of Sweden for the production of high-value biomass containing antiproliferative compounds  carotenoids  and EPA.,Autophagy_notLIR
Rubioncolin C  a natural naphthohydroquinone dimer isolated from Rubia yunnanensis  inhibits the proliferation and metastasis by inducing ROS-mediated apoptotic and autophagic cell death in triple-negative breast cancer cells.Rubia yunnanensis Diels is a traditional Chinese medicine that has diverse pharmacological activities  including antituberculosis  antirheumatism and anticancers. Rubioncolin C (RC)  a natural naphthohydroquinone dimer isolated from the roots and rhizomes of R. yunnanensis Diels  has shown potent antitumor activity.

LncRNA NEAT1 induces autophagy through the miR-128-3p/ADAM28 axis to suppress apoptosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer.This study aimed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying NEAT1 regulation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) autophagy and apoptosis. The expression levels of NEAT1  miR-128-3p  and ADAM28 in NSCLC tissues and cells were examined using qRT-PCR. The relationships between NEAT1  miR-128-3p  and ADAM28 expression levels and prognosis of NSCLC patients were investigated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis method. The interactions between NEAT1  miR-128-3p  and ADAM28 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay or FISH assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays  respectively. Apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins Bax  cleaved caspase-3  cleaved caspase-9  Bcl-2  LC3  Beclin-1  and p62 were analyzed by western blotting. Finally  an in vivo NSCLC mouse xenograft model was established to confirm the in vitro data. We showed NEAT1 and ADAM28 expression levels were upregulated  while the miR-128-3p level was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. NSCLC patients with high NEAT1 expression levels  low miR-128-3p levels  or high ADAM28 levels had significantly reduced overall survival times. Silencing of NEAT1 inhibited NSCLC cell autophagy and promoted apoptosis by sponging miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p directly targeted ADAM28 and suppressed ADAM28 expression  which led to deactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore  ADAM28 overexpression attenuated miR-128-3p overexpression-induced apoptosis and autophagy inhibition in NSCLC by increasing the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. NEAT1 depletion or miR-128-3p overexpression inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in vivo by suppressing ADAM28. In other word  silencing NEAT1 inhibited autophagy and then promoted NSCLC cell apoptosis by deactivating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway through regulation of miR-128-3p/ADAM28 axis.,Autophagy_notLIR

However  the potential anti-tumour effects of T-96 against human Prostate cancer (CaP) cells and the possible underlying mechanisms have not been well studied.,Autophagy_notLIR
Targeting Mitochondrial Dynamics Proteins for the Development of Therapies for Cardiovascular Diseases.Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The identification of new pathogenetic targets contributes to more efficient development of new types of drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights the problem of mitochondrial dynamics disorders  in the context of cardiovascular diseases. A change in the normal function of mitochondrial dynamics proteins is one of the reasons for the development of the pathological state of cardiomyocytes. Based on this  therapeutic targeting of these proteins may be a promising strategy in the development of cardiac drugs. Here we will consider changes for each process of mitochondrial dynamics in cardiovascular diseases: fission and fusion of mitochondria  mitophagy  mitochondrial transport and biogenesis  and also analyze the prospects of the considered protein targets based on existing drug developments.,Autophagy_notLIR
TXNIP/VDUP1 attenuates steatohepatitis via autophagy and fatty acid oxidation.Impaired macroautophagy/autophagy has been implicated in experimental and human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However  the mechanism underlying autophagy dysregulation in NASH is largely unknown. Here  we investigated the role and mechanism of TXNIP/VDUP1 (thioredoxin interacting protein)  a key mediator of cellular stress responses  in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hepatic TXNIP expression was upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients and in methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice  as well as in palmitic acid (PA)-treated hepatocytes. Upregulation of hepatic TXNIP was positively correlated with impaired autophagy  as evidenced by a decreased number of MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) puncta and increased SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) expression. Deletion of the <i>Txnip</i> gene enhanced hepatic steatosis  inflammation  and fibrosis  accompanied by impaired autophagy and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in MCD diet-fed mice. Mechanistically  TXNIP directly interacted with and positively regulated p-PRKAA  leading to inactivation of MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1) and nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB)  which in turn promoted autophagy. Inhibition of MTORC1 by rapamycin induced autophagy and increased the expression levels of FAO-related genes and concomitantly attenuated lipid accumulation in PA-treated <i>txnip</i>-knockout (KO) hepatocytes  which was further abolished by silencing of <i>Atg7</i>. Rapamycin treatment also attenuated MCD diet-induced steatosis  inflammation  and fibrosis with increased TFEB nuclear translocation and restored FAO in <i>txnip</i>-KO mice. Our findings suggest that elevated TXNIP ameliorates steatohepatitis by interacting with PRKAA and thereby inducing autophagy and FAO. Targeting TXNIP may be a potential therapeutic approach for NASH.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ACOX1: acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 1  palmitoyl; ACSL1: acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1; ACTA2/α-SMA: actin  alpha 2  smooth muscle  aorta; ACTB: actin beta; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy-related; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; COL1A1/Col1α1: collagen  type I  alpha 1; CPT1A: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a  liver; CQ: chloroquine; DGAT1: diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1; DGAT2: diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2; ECI2/Peci: enoyl-Coenzyme A isomerase 2; EHHADH: enoyl-Coenzyme A  hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A dehydrogenase; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; FASN: fatty acid synthase; FFA: free fatty acids; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GK/GYK: glycerol kinase; GOT1/AST: glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1  soluble; GPAM: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  mitochondrial; GPT/ALT: glutamic pyruvic transaminase  soluble; H&E: hematoxylin and eosin; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; IOD: integral optical density; KO: knockout; Leu: leupeptin; LPIN1: lipin 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MCD: methionine choline-deficient; MMP9: matrix metallopeptidase 9; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases; NASH: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; PA: palmitic acid; PPARA/PPARα: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; PPARG/PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time PCR; RPS6KB1/p70S6K1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase  polypeptide 1; RPTOR: regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1; SCD1: stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1; SEM: standard error of the mean; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TG: triglyceride; TGFB/TGF-β: transforming growth factor  beta; TIMP1: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; TXNIP/VDUP1: thioredoxin interacting protein; WT: wild-type.,Autophagy_notLIR
The pivotal role of FAM134B in selective ER-phagy and diseases.FAM134B is also known as the reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1) or JK-1. FAM134B consists of two long hydrophobic fragments with a reticulon-homology domain  an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain  and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. FAM134B plays an important role in regulating selective ER-phagy  and is related to the occurrence and development of many diseases. In the present review  we describe theFAM134B molecular structure  subcellular localization  tissue distribution  and review its mechanisms of action during selective ER-phagy. Furthermore  we summarize the relationship between FAM134B and diseases  including neoplastic diseases  degenerative diseases  central nervous system disease  and infectious diseases.

Physiologic and molecular characterization of a novel murine model of metastatic head and neck cancer cachexia.Cancer cachexia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the progressive loss of fat and lean mass that results in significant wasting  ultimately leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Effective therapies for cachexia are lacking  potentially owing to the mismatch in clinically relevant models of cachexia. Specifically  cachexia observed in a clinical setting is commonly associated with advanced or late-stage cancers that are metastatic  yet pre-clinical metastatic models of cachexia are limited. Furthermore  the prevalence of cachexia in head and neck cancer patients is high  yet few pre-clinical models of head and neck cancer cachexia exist. In addition to these shortcomings  cachexia is also heterogeneous among any given cancer  whereas patients with similar disease burden may experience significantly different degrees of cachexia symptoms. In order to address these issues  we characterize a metastatic model of human papilloma virus (HPV) positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that recapitulates the cardinal clinical and molecular features of cancer cachexia.,Autophagy_notLIR
β-hydroxybutyrate enhances bovine neutrophil adhesion by inhibiting autophagy.Subclinical ketosis (SCK) in dairy cows  a common metabolic disorder during the perinatal period  is accompanied by systemic inflammation and a high concentration of blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB induced adhesion of neutrophils may play a crucial role in the development of systemic inflammation in SCK cows. Autophagy  an intracellular degradation system  regulates the recycling of membrane adhesion molecules and may be involved in BHB regulating adhesion and pro-inflammatory activation of bovine neutrophils. Thus  the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between BHB  autophagy  and neutrophil adhesion.,Autophagy_notLIR
Identification of novel lipid droplet factors that regulate lipophagy and cholesterol efflux in macrophage foam cells.Macrophage autophagy is a highly anti-atherogenic process that promotes the catabolism of cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis. Selective autophagy relies on tags such as ubiquitin and a set of selectivity factors including selective autophagy receptors (SARs) to label specific cargo for degradation. Originally described in yeast cells  "lipophagy" refers to the degradation of LDs by autophagy. Yet  how LDs are targeted for autophagy is poorly defined. Here  we employed mass spectrometry to identify lipophagy factors within the macrophage foam cell LD proteome. In addition to structural proteins (e.g.  PLIN2)  metabolic enzymes (e.g.  ACSL) and neutral lipases (e.g.  PNPLA2)  we found the association of proteins related to the ubiquitination machinery (e.g.  AUP1) and autophagy (e.g.  HMGB  YWHA/14-3-3 proteins). The functional role of candidate lipophagy factors (a total of 91) was tested using a custom siRNA array combined with high-content cholesterol efflux assays. We observed that knocking down several of these genes  including <i>Hmgb1  Hmgb2  Hspa5</i>  and <i>Scarb2</i>  significantly reduced cholesterol efflux  and SARs SQSTM1/p62  NBR1 and OPTN localized to LDs  suggesting a role for these in lipophagy. Using yeast lipophagy assays  we established a genetic requirement for several candidate lipophagy factors in lipophagy  including HSPA5  UBE2G2 and AUP1. Our study is the first to systematically identify several LD-associated proteins of the lipophagy machinery  a finding with important biological and therapeutic implications. Targeting these to selectively enhance lipophagy to promote cholesterol efflux in foam cells may represent a novel strategy to treat atherosclerosis.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ADGRL3: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3; agLDL: aggregated low density lipoprotein; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; APOA1: apolipoprotein A1; ATG: autophagy related; AUP1: AUP1 lipid droplet regulating VLDL assembly factor; BMDM: bone-marrow derived macrophages; BNIP3L: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CIRBP: cold inducible RNA binding protein; COLGALT1: collagen beta(1-O)galactosyltransferase 1; CORO1A: coronin 1A; DMA: deletion mutant array; Faa4: long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FUS: fused in sarcoma; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; HMGB2: high mobility group box 2: HSP90AA1: heat shock protein 90: alpha (cytosolic): class A member 1; HSPA5: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5; HSPA8: heat shock protein 8; HSPB1: heat shock protein 1; HSPH1: heat shock 105kDa/110kDa protein 1; LDAH: lipid droplet associated hydrolase; LIPA: lysosomal acid lipase A; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MACROH2A1: macroH2A.1 histone; MAP1LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MCOLN1: mucolipin 1; NBR1: NBR1  autophagy cargo receptor; NPC2: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2; OPTN: optineurin; P/S: penicillin-streptomycin; PLIN2: perilipin 2; PLIN3: perilipin 3; PNPLA2: patatin like phospholipase domain containing 2; RAB: RAB  member RAS oncogene family; RBBP7  retinoblastoma binding protein 7  chromatin remodeling factor; SAR: selective autophagy receptor; SCARB2: scavenger receptor class B  member 2; SGA: synthetic genetic array; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 (human T cell leukemia virus type I) binding protein 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TOLLIP: toll interacting protein; UBE2G2: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 G2; UVRAG: UV radiation resistance associated gene; VDAC2: voltage dependent anion channel 2; VIM: vimentin.,Autophagy_notLIR

Molecular hydrogen is a promising therapeutic agent for pulmonary disease.Molecular hydrogen exerts biological effects on nearly all organs. It has anti-oxidative  anti-inflammatory  and anti-aging effects and contributes to the regulation of autophagy and cell death. As the primary organ for gas exchange  the lungs are constantly exposed to various harmful environmental irritants. Short- or long-term exposure to these harmful substances often results in lung injury  causing respiratory and lung diseases. Acute and chronic respiratory diseases have high rates of morbidity and mortality and have become a major public health concern worldwide. For example  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. An increasing number of studies have revealed that hydrogen may protect the lungs from diverse diseases  including acute lung injury  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  asthma  lung cancer  pulmonary arterial hypertension  and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review  we highlight the multiple functions of hydrogen and the mechanisms underlying its protective effects in various lung diseases  with a focus on its roles in disease pathogenesis and clinical significance.,Autophagy_notLIR
Antibacterial and antitumoral properties of 1 2 3-triazolo fused triterpenes and their mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of HL-60 cells.Antimicrobial resistance and cancer are two important problems affecting human health. Actively developing novel antibiotics and anticancer medicines is a priority. Natural pentacyclic triterpenoids have attracted wide attention due to their significant biological activities. In this study  a series of 1 2 3-triazolo fused triterpenoids (betulin  oleanolic acid and ursolic acid) were functionalized on the A-ring by an in-house developed multi-component triazolization reaction. The compounds were investigated for antitumoral activity in twelve cancer cell lines and were also tested for antibacterial activity against four bacteria. In terms of anticancer effects  compounds 5b-f and 8a-d displayed strong cytotoxic activity in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1)  chronic myeloid leukemia (Hap-1)  acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60)  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Rec-1) cell lines. Among them  compound 5f exhibited the most potent antiproliferative effect on HL-60 cells. Further pharmacological research confirmed that compound 5f caused mitochondrial dysfunction and arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase to induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells. In addition  compound 5f also induced autophagy to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Antibacterial screening revealed that compounds 2a-g and 5a-d showed modest activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica) with especially compounds 2c and 2d being potent inhibitors of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica growth. Because of their promising anticancer and antibacterial activity  this series of compounds deserve further study.,Autophagy_notLIR
Hsp22 Deficiency Induces Age-Dependent Cardiac Dilation and Dysfunction by Impairing Autophagy  Metabolism  and Oxidative Response.Heat shock protein 22 (Hsp22) is a small heat shock protein predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Previous studies indicate that Hsp22 plays a vital role in protecting the heart against cardiac stress. However  the essential role of Hsp22 in the heart under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. In this study  we used an Hsp22 knockout (KO) mouse model to determine whether loss of Hsp22 impairs cardiac growth and function with increasing age under physiological conditions. Cardiac structural and functional alterations at baseline were measured using echocardiography and invasive catheterization in Hsp22 KO mice during aging transition compared to their age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. Our results showed that Hsp22 deletion induced progressive cardiac dilation along with declined function during the aging transition. Mechanistically  the loss of Hsp22 impaired BCL-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) expression and its associated cardiac autophagy  undermined cardiac energy metabolism homeostasis and increased oxidative damage. This study showed that Hsp22 played an essential role in the non-stressed heart during the early stage of aging  which may bring new insight into understanding the pathogenesis of age-related dilated cardiomyopathy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Autophagy Markers in Soleus Muscle Disuse-Induced Atrophy of Rats Treated with Fish Oil.Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and autophagy pathways are implicated in disuse muscle atrophy. The effects of high eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or high docosahexaenoic (DHA) fish oils on soleus muscle ERS and autophagy markers were investigated in a rat hindlimb suspension (HS) atrophy model. Adult Wistar male rats received daily by gavage supplementation (0.3 mL per 100 g b.w.) of mineral oil or high EPA or high DHA fish oils (FOs) for two weeks. Afterward  the rats were subjected to HS and the respective treatments concomitantly for an additional two-week period. After four weeks  we evaluated ERS and autophagy markers in the soleus muscle. Results were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc test. Gastrocnemius muscle ω-6/ω-3 fatty acids (FAs) ratio was decreased by both FOs indicating the tissue incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids. HS altered (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the protein content (decreasing total p38 and BiP and increasing p-JNK2/total JNK2 ratio  and caspase 3) and gene expressions (decreasing BiP and increasing IRE1 and PERK) of ERS and autophagy (decreasing Beclin and increasing LC3 and ATG14) markers in soleus. Both FOs attenuated (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the increase in PERK and ATG14 expressions induced by HS. Thus  both FOs could potentially attenuate ERS and autophagy in skeletal muscles undergoing atrophy.,Autophagy_notLIR
Alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding may confer similar neuroprotective effects during aging in male rats.Age associated neurodegenerative changes are acknowledged to play a causative role in a majority of neurological diseases that accompany aging in organisms. To alleviate the deteriorative effects of aging in the brain  we investigated the effects oftwo types of intermittent fasting (IF) methods: alternate day fasting (ADF) and time- restricted feeding (TRF) in young (3 months) and old (24 months) in male Wistar rats comparing the results with age matched controls. The evaluation of biomarkers of oxidative stress showed significant decline in the old (ADF and TRF) groups in addition to up regulation in antioxidant levels. It was observed that ADF and TRF methods helped reduce ROS accumulation in the mitochondria and increased the activity of the electron transport chain complexes especially C-I and III. Gene expression analysis of autophagy genes like beclin and LC3B showed upregulated expression in ADF and TRF group. Sirtuin1 expression too significantly increased during fasting in both young and old groups showing fasting induced protection from aging. Histological analysis of sections of cerebral cortex and CA1 area provide evidence that fasting protected neurons against degeneration with age. Our results prompt us to conclude that the efficacy of these fasting methods ADF and TRF are reliable anti- aging strategies with respect to dietary restriction interventions. Moreover  both these methods compete closely in conferring protection from oxidative stress and inducing neuroprotective changes in brain of aged rats when compared to their young counterparts.,Autophagy_notLIR

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells can directly lyse malignant or infected cells in at least two ways: granule-mediated cytotoxicity  involving perforin and granzyme B  or death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity  involving the death receptor ligands  tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas ligand (FasL). In either case  a multi-step pathway is triggered to facilitate lysis  relying on active pro-death processes and signalling within the target cell. Because of this reliance on an active response from the target cell  each mechanism of cell-mediated killing can be manipulated by malignant and infected cells to evade cytolytic death. Here  we review the mechanisms of cell-mediated cytotoxicity and examine how cells may evade these cytolytic processes. This includes resistance to perforin through degradation or reduced pore formation  resistance to granzyme B through inhibition or autophagy  and resistance to death receptors through inhibition of downstream signalling or changes in protein expression. We also consider the importance of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity and resistance mechanisms against this pathway. Altogether  it is clear that target cells are not passive bystanders to cell-mediated cytotoxicity and resistance mechanisms can significantly constrain immune cell-mediated killing. Understanding these processes of immune evasion may lead to novel ideas for medical intervention.,Autophagy_notLIR
Curcumin protects human umbilical vein endothelial cells against high oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced lipotoxicity and modulates autophagy.Endothelial dysfunction is a precursor of cardiovascular disease  and protecting endothelial cells from damage is a treatment strategy for atherosclerosis (AS). Curcumin  a natural polyphenolic compound  has been shown to protect endothelial cells from dysfunction. In the present study  we investigated whether curcumin could ameliorate high oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced endothelial lipotoxicity by inducing autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).,Autophagy_notLIR
Nanosized copper particles induced mesangial cell toxicity via the autophagy pathway.Nanosized copper particles (nano Cu) have been incorporated into products in multiple industries  although studies have demonstrated that these particles are nephrotoxic. We investigated the cytotoxicity of nanosized copper particles on rat mesangial cells and measured rates of apoptosis  the expression of caspase-3  and generation of reactive oxygen species. We also measured autophagy through the acridine orange (AO) staining and expression of Beclin-1  microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3  and p62 to screen the underlying mechanism of toxicity. Nanosized copper particles inhibited mesangial cell viability  up-regulated the activity of caspase-3  and increased the rates of apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to nano Cu increased the formation of acidic vesicular organelles and the expression of Beclin-1  microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3  and p62  and treatment with an autophagy inhibitor reduced nephrotoxicity. This indicated that the autophagy pathway is involved in the toxicity induced by nanosized copper particles to mesangial cells. This finding can contribute to the development of safety guidelines for the evaluation of nanomaterials in the future.,Autophagy_notLIR
Alternative careers at the autophagy factory.During autophagy  proteins of the ATG8 family are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in double-membrane structures called phagophores. Now  Durgan et al. have found that  during the non-canonical process of conjugating ATG8 proteins to single-membrane structures  ATG8 can be ligated to phosphatidylserine. Here  I discuss the potential consequences of their findings.,Autophagy_notLIR
Regulation of neuronal autophagy and the implications in neurodegenerative diseases.Neurons are highly polarized and post-mitotic cells with the specific requirements of neurotransmission accompanied by high metabolic demands that create a unique challenge for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Thus  neurons rely heavily on autophagy that constitutes a key quality control system by which dysfunctional cytoplasmic components  protein aggregates  and damaged organelles are sequestered within autophagosomes and then delivered to the lysosome for degradation. While mature lysosomes are predominantly located in the soma of neurons  the robust  constitutive biogenesis of autophagosomes occurs in the synaptic terminal via a conserved pathway that is required to maintain synaptic integrity and function. Following formation  autophagosomes fuse with late endosomes and then are rapidly and efficiently transported by the microtubule-based cytoplasmic dynein motor along the axon toward the soma for lysosomal clearance. In this review  we highlight the recent knowledge of the roles of autophagy in neuronal health and disease. We summarize the available evidence about the normal functions of autophagy as a protective factor against neurodegeneration and discuss the mechanism underlying neuronal autophagy regulation. Finally  we describe how autophagy function is affected in major neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on Alzheimer's disease  Parkinson's disease  and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,Autophagy_notLIR
FGF10 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice <i>via</i> the BMP4-autophagy pathway.<b>Introduction:</b> Damage to alveolar epithelial cells caused by uncontrolled inflammation is considered to be the main pathophysiological change in acute lung injury. FGF10 plays an important role as a fibroblast growth factor in lung development and lung diseases  but its protective effect against acute lung injury is unclear. Therefore  this study aimed to investigate protective effect and mechanism of FGF10 on acute lung injury in mice. <b>Methods:</b> ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into 57BL/6J mice. Six hours later  lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells  protein and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels  and lung issues were collected for histologic examination and wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. <b>Results:</b> We found that FGF10 can prevent the release of IL-6  TNF-α  and IL-1β  increase the expression of BMP4 and autophagy pathway  promote the regeneration of alveolar epithelial type Ⅱ cells  and improve acute lung injury. BMP4 gene knockdown decreased the protective effect of FGF10 on the lung tissue of mice. However  the activation of autophagy was reduced after BMP4 inhibition by Noggin. Additionally  the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA also lowered the protective effect of FGF10 on alveolar epithelial cells induced by LPS. <b>Conclusions:</b> These data suggest that the protective effect of FGF10 is related to the activation of autophagy and regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells in an LPS-induced ALI model  and that the activation of autophagy may depend on the increase in BMP4 expression.,Autophagy_notLIR
Autophagic targeting of Src promotes cancer cell survival following reduced FAK signalling.Here we describe a mechanism that cancer cells use to survive when flux through the Src/FAK pathway is severely perturbed. Depletion of FAK  detachment of FAK-proficient cells or expression of non-phosphorylatable FAK proteins causes sequestration of active Src away from focal adhesions into intracellular puncta that co-stain with several autophagy regulators. Inhibition of autophagy results in restoration of active Src at peripheral adhesions  and this leads to cancer cell death. Autophagic targeting of active Src is associated with a Src-LC3B complex  and is mediated by c-Cbl. However  this is independent of c-Cbl E3 ligase activity  but is mediated by an LC3-interacting region. Thus  c-Cbl-mediated autophagic targeting of active Src can occur in cancer cells to maintain viability when flux through the integrin/Src/FAK pathway is disrupted. This exposes a previously unrecognized cancer cell vulnerability that may provide a new therapeutic opportunity. ,Autophagy_LIR

Starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (Stbd1) and glycogen metabolism: Identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1.Glycogen  a branched polymer of glucose  acts as an intracellular carbon and energy reserve in many tissues and cell types. An important pathway for its degradation is by transport to lysosomes in an autophagy-like process. It has been proposed that starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (Stbd1) may participate in this mechanism by anchoring glycogen to intracellular membranes. In addition  Stbd1 has been reported to interact with a known autophagy protein  GABARAPL1  a member of the Atg8 family. Here  we confirm this interaction and identify an Atg8 interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 necessary for GABARAPL1 binding as judged by co-immunoprecipitation from cell extracts and co-localization in cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence microscopy. The AIM sequence of Stbd1 (200)HEEWEMV(206) lies within a predicted disordered region of the molecule and fits the consensus of other AIM sequences in cargo-specifying proteins such as p62 and Nix. Mutation of the AIM  including single point mutations of either W203 or V206  eliminated the co-localization of Stbd1 with both over-expressed and endogenous GABARAPL1. Stbd1 may therefore function as a novel cargo binding protein that delivers glycogen to lysosomes in an autophagic pathway that could be termed "glycophagy". ,Autophagy_LIR

Identification and functional analysis of Joka2  a tobacco member of the family of selective autophagy cargo receptors.Two main mechanisms of protein turnover exist in eukaryotic cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Autophagy is an emerging important constituent of many physiological and pathological processes  such as response to nutrient deficiency  programmed cell death and innate immune response. In mammalian cells the selectivity of autophagy is ensured by the presence of cargo receptors  such as p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1  responsible for sequestration of the ubiquitinated proteins. In plants no selective cargo receptors have been identified yet. The present report indicates that structural and functional homologs of p62 and NBR1 proteins exist in plants. The tobacco protein  named Joka2  has been identified in yeast two-hybrid search as a binding partner of a small coiled-coil protein  a member of UP9/LSU family of unknown function  encoded by the UP9C gene strongly and specifically induced during sulfur deficiency. The typical domains of p62 and NBR1 are conserved in Joka2. Similarly to p62  Joka2-YFP has dual localization (cytosolic speckles and the nucleus); it forms homodimers and interacts with a member of the ATG8 family. Increased expression of Joka2 and ATG8f was observed in roots of tobacco plants grown for two days in nutrient-deficient conditions. Constitutive ectopic expression of Joka2-YFP in tobacco resulted in attenuated response (manifested by lesser yellowing of the leaves) to nutrient deficiency. In conclusion  Joka2  and presumably the process of selective autophagy  might constitute an important part of plant response to environmental stresses. ,Autophagy_LIR

Characterization of the interaction of GABARAPL-1 with the LIR motif of NBR1.Selective autophagy requires the specific segregation of targeted proteins into autophagosomes. The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors  such as p62 and NBR1  which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast  MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. Recognition of autophagy receptors by autophagy effectors takes place through an LC3 interaction region (LIR). The canonical LIR motif consists of a WXXL sequence  N-terminally preceded by negatively charged residues. The LIR motif of NBR1 presents differences to this classical LIR motif with a tyrosine residue and an isoleucine residue substituting the tryptophan residue and the leucine residue  respectively. We have determined the structure of the GABARAPL-1/NBR1-LIR complex and studied the influence of the different residues belonging to the LIR motif for the interaction with several mammalian autophagy modifiers (LC3B and GABARAPL-1). Our results indicate that the presence of a tryptophan residue in the LIR motif increases the binding affinity. Substitution by other aromatic amino acids or increasing the number of negatively charged residues at the N-terminus of the LIR motif  however  has little effect on the binding affinity due to enthalpy-entropy compensation. This indicates that different LIRs can interact with autophagy modifiers with unique binding properties. ,Autophagy_LIR

Plant NBR1 is a selective autophagy substrate and a functional hybrid of the mammalian autophagic adapters NBR1 and p62/SQSTM1.(Macro)autophagy encompasses both an unselective  bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents as well as selective autophagy of damaged organelles  intracellular microbes  protein aggregates  cellular structures and specific soluble proteins. Selective autophagy is mediated by autophagic adapters  like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1. p62 and NBR1 are themselves selective autophagy substrates  but they also act as cargo receptors for degradation of other substrates. Surprisingly  we found that homologs of NBR1 are distributed throughout the eukaryotic kingdom  while p62 is confined to the metazoans. As a representative of all organisms having only an NBR1 homolog we studied Arabidopsis thaliana NBR1 (AtNBR1) in more detail. AtNBR1 is more similar to mammalian NBR1 than to p62 in domain architecture and amino acid sequence. However  similar to p62  AtNBR1 homo-polymerizes via the PB1 domain. Hence  AtNBR1 has hybrid properties of mammalian NBR1 and p62. AtNBR1 has 2 UBA domains  but only the C-terminal UBA domain bound ubiquitin. AtNBR1 bound AtATG8 through a conserved LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif and required co-expression of AtATG8 or human GABARAPL2 to be recognized as an autophagic substrate in HeLa cells. To monitor the autophagic sequestration of AtNBR1 in Arabidopsis we made transgenic plants expressing AtNBR1 fused to a pH-sensitive fluorescent tag  a tandem fusion of the red  acid-insensitive mCherry and the acid-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteins. This strategy allowed us to show that AtNBR1 is an autophagy substrate degraded in the vacuole dependent on the polymerization property of the PB1 domain and of expression of AtATG7. A functional LIR was required for vacuolar import. ,Autophagy_LIR

OATL1  a novel autophagosome-resident Rab33B-GAP  regulates autophagosomal maturation.Macroautophagy is a bulk degradation system conserved in all eukaryotic cells. A ubiquitin-like protein  Atg8  and its homologues are essential for autophagosome formation and act as a landmark for selective autophagy of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. In this study  we report evidence demonstrating that OATL1  a putative Rab guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP)  is a novel binding partner of Atg8 homologues in mammalian cells. OATL1 is recruited to isolation membranes and autophagosomes through direct interaction with Atg8 homologues and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes through its GAP activity. We further provide evidence that Rab33B  an Atg16L1-binding protein  is a target substrate of OATL1 and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes  the same as OATL1. Because both its GAP activity and its Atg8 homologue-binding activity are required for OATL1 to function  we propose a model that OATL1 uses Atg8 homologues as a scaffold to exert its GAP activity and to regulate autophagosomal maturation. ,Autophagy_LIR

The Arabidopsis multistress regulator TSPO is a heme binding membrane protein and a potential scavenger of porphyrins via an autophagy-dependent degradation mechanism.TSPO  a stress-induced  posttranslationally regulated  early secretory pathway-localized plant cell membrane protein  belongs to the TspO/MBR family of regulatory proteins  which can bind porphyrins. This work finds that boosting tetrapyrrole biosynthesis enhanced TSPO degradation in Arabidopsis thaliana and that TSPO could bind heme in vitro and in vivo. This binding required the His residue at position 91 (H91)  but not that at position 115 (H115). The H91A and double H91A/H115A substitutions stabilized TSPO and rendered the protein insensitive to heme-regulated degradation  suggesting that heme binding regulates At-TSPO degradation. TSPO degradation was inhibited in the autophagy-defective atg5 mutant and was sensitive to inhibitors of type III phosphoinositide 3-kinases  which regulate autophagy in eukaryotic cells. Mutation of the two Tyr residues in a putative ubiquitin-like ATG8 interacting motif of At-TSPO did not affect heme binding in vitro but stabilized the protein in vivo  suggesting that downregulation of At-TSPO requires an active autophagy pathway  in addition to heme. Abscisic acid-dependent TSPO induction was accompanied by an increase in unbound heme levels  and downregulation of TSPO coincided with the return to steady state levels of unbound heme  suggesting that a physiological consequence of active TSPO downregulation may be heme scavenging. In addition  overexpression of TSPO attenuated aminolevulinic acid-induced porphyria in plant cells. Taken together  these data support a role for TSPO in porphyrin binding and scavenging during stress in plants. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy negatively regulates Wnt signalling by promoting Dishevelled degradation.In eukaryotic cells  autophagy is a highly conserved self-digestion process to promote cell survival in response to nutrient starvation and other metabolic stresses. Autophagy is regulated by cell signalling such as the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. However  the significance of autophagy in modulation of signal transduction is unclear. Here we show that autophagy negatively regulates Wnt signalling by promoting Dishevelled (Dvl) degradation. Von Hippel-Lindau protein-mediated ubiquitylation is critical for the binding of Dvl2 to p62  which in turn facilitates the aggregation and the LC3-mediated autophagosome recruitment of Dvl2 under starvation; the ubiquitylated Dvl2 aggregates are ultimately degraded through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Moreover  a reverse correlation between Dvl expression and autophagy is observed in late stages of colon cancer development  indicating that autophagy may contribute to the aberrant activation of Wnt signalling in tumour formation. ,Autophagy_LIR

Selective transport of alpha-mannosidase by autophagic pathways: identification of a novel receptor  Atg34p.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae  aminopeptidase I (Ape1p) and α-mannosidase (Ams1p) are known cargoes of selective autophagy. Atg19p has been identified as an Ape1p receptor and targets Ape1p to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). Under nutrient-rich conditions  transport of Ams1p to the vacuole largely depends on Atg19p. Here  we show that Atg34p (Yol083wp)  a homolog of Atg19p  is a receptor for Ams1p transport during autophagy. Atg34p interacted with Ams1p  Atg11p  and Atg8p using distinct domains. Homo-oligomerized Ams1p bound to the Ams1-binding domain of Atg34p; this binding was important for the formation of a higher order complex named the Ams1 complex. In the absence of the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p  the Ams1 complex was targeted to the preautophagosomal structure but failed to transit to the vacuole  indicating that the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p is crucial for the Ams1 complex to be enclosed by autophagosomes. Atg34p and Atg19p have similar domain structures and are important for Ams1p transport during autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8) family interacting motif in Atg3 mediates the Atg3-Atg8 interaction and is crucial for the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway.The autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8) conjugation system is essential for the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes during autophagy  a bulk degradation process conserved among most eukaryotes. It is also important in yeast for recognizing target vacuolar enzymes through the receptor protein Atg19 during the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway  a selective type of autophagy. Atg3 is an E2-like enzyme that conjugates Atg8 with phosphatidylethanolamine. Here  we show that Atg3 directly interacts with Atg8 through the WEDL sequence  which is distinct from canonical interaction between E2 and ubiquitin-like modifiers. Moreover  NMR experiments suggest that the mode of interaction between Atg8 and Atg3 is quite similar to that between Atg8/LC3 and the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) conserved in autophagic receptors  such as Atg19 and p62. Thus  the WEDL sequence in Atg3 is a canonical AIM. In vitro analyses showed that Atg3 AIM is crucial for the transfer of Atg8 from the Atg8∼Atg3 thioester intermediate to phosphatidylethanolamine but not for the formation of the intermediate. Intriguingly  in vivo experiments showed that it is necessary for the Cvt pathway but not for starvation-induced autophagy. Atg3 AIM attenuated the inhibitory effect of Atg19 on Atg8 lipidation in vitro  suggesting that Atg3 AIM may be important for the lipidation of Atg19-bound Atg8 during the Cvt pathway. ,Autophagy_LIR

Network organization of the human autophagy system.Autophagy  the process by which proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation  provides a primary route for turnover of stable and defective cellular proteins. Defects in this system are linked with numerous human diseases. Although conserved protein kinase  lipid kinase and ubiquitin-like protein conjugation subnetworks controlling autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment have been defined  our understanding of the global organization of this system is limited. Here we report a proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells under conditions of ongoing (basal) autophagy  revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409 candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among subnetworks. Many new autophagy interaction network components have roles in vesicle trafficking  protein or lipid phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination  and affect autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The six ATG8 orthologues in humans (MAP1LC3/GABARAP proteins) interact with a cohort of 67 proteins  with extensive binding partner overlap between family members  and frequent involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. These studies provide a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein homeostasis pathway. ,Autophagy_LIR

FYCO1 is a Rab7 effector that binds to LC3 and PI3P to mediate microtubule plus end-directed vesicle transport.Autophagy is the main eukaryotic degradation pathway for long-lived proteins  protein aggregates  and cytosolic organelles. Although the protein machinery involved in the biogenesis of autophagic vesicles is well described  very little is known about the mechanism of cytosolic transport of autophagosomes. In this study  we have identified an adaptor protein complex  formed by the two autophagic membrane-associated proteins LC3 and Rab7 and the novel FYVE and coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing protein FYCO1  that promotes microtubule (MT) plus end-directed transport of autophagic vesicles. We have characterized the LC3-  Rab7-  and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-binding domains in FYCO1 and mapped part of the CC region essential for MT plus end-directed transport. We also propose a mechanism for selective autophagosomal membrane recruitment of FYCO1. ,Autophagy_LIR

Nix is a selective autophagy receptor for mitochondrial clearance.Autophagy is the cellular homeostatic pathway that delivers large cytosolic materials for degradation in the lysosome. Recent evidence indicates that autophagy mediates selective removal of protein aggregates  organelles and microbes in cells. Yet  the specificity in targeting a particular substrate to the autophagy pathway remains poorly understood. Here  we show that the mitochondrial protein Nix is a selective autophagy receptor by binding to LC3/GABARAP proteins  ubiquitin-like modifiers that are required for the growth of autophagosomal membranes. In cultured cells  Nix recruits GABARAP-L1 to damaged mitochondria through its amino-terminal LC3-interacting region. Furthermore  ablation of the Nix:LC3/GABARAP interaction retards mitochondrial clearance in maturing murine reticulocytes. Thus  Nix functions as an autophagy receptor  which mediates mitochondrial clearance after mitochondrial damage and during erythrocyte differentiation. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mitochondria-anchored receptor Atg32 mediates degradation of mitochondria via selective autophagy.Mitochondria are essential organelles that produce most of the energy for a cell  but concomitantly accumulate oxidative damage. Degradation of damaged mitochondria is critical for cell homeostasis  and this process is thought to be mediated by mitophagy  an autophagy-related pathway specific for mitochondria. However  whether mitochondria are selectively degraded  and how the autophagic machinery is targeted to mitochondria  remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that  in post-log phase cells under respiratory conditions  a substantial fraction of mitochondria are exclusively sequestered as cargoes and transported to the vacuole  a lytic compartment in yeast  in an autophagy-dependent manner. Interestingly  we found Atg32  a mitochondria-anchored protein essential for mitophagy that is induced during respiratory growth. In addition  our data suggest that Atg32 interacts with Atg8 and Atg11  autophagy-related proteins critical for recognition of cargo receptors. We propose that Atg32 acts as a mitophagy-specific receptor and regulates selective degradation of mitochondria. ,Autophagy_LIR

Nix directly binds to GABARAP: a possible crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy.Autophagy  a pathway primarily relevant for cell survival  and apoptosis  a process invariably leading to cell death  are the two main mechanisms of cellular self-destruction  which are essential in cell growth  neurodegeneration  tumor suppression  stress and immune response. Currently  a potential crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy is subject to intensive investigations since recently some direct junctions became obvious. The respective protein-protein interaction network  however  remains to be elucidated in detail. The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor-associated protein GABARAP belongs to a family of proteins implicated in intracellular transport events and was shown to be associated to autophagic processes. Using a phage display screening against the target protein GABARAP  we identified the proapoptotic protein Nix/Bnip3L to be a potential GABARAP ligand. In vitro binding studies  pull-down analysis  coimmunoprecipitation assays and colocalization studies confirmed a direct interaction of both proteins in mammalian cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

The structure of Atg4B-LC3 complex reveals the mechanism of LC3 processing and delipidation during autophagy.Atg8 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by ubiquitin-like conjugation reactions. Atg8 has at least two functions in autophagy: membrane biogenesis and target recognition. Regulation of PE conjugation and deconjugation of Atg8 is crucial for these functions in which Atg4 has a critical function by both processing Atg8 precursors and deconjugating Atg8-PE. Here  we report the crystal structures of catalytically inert human Atg4B (HsAtg4B) in complex with processed and unprocessed forms of LC3  a mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg8. On LC3 binding  the regulatory loop and the N-terminal tail of HsAtg4B undergo large conformational changes. The regulatory loop masking the entrance of the active site of free HsAtg4B is lifted by LC3 Phe119  so that a groove is formed along which the LC3 tail enters the active site. At the same time  the N-terminal tail masking the exit of the active site of HsAtg4B in the free form is detached from the enzyme core and a large flat surface is exposed  which might enable the enzyme to access the membrane-bound LC3-PE. ,Autophagy_LIR

A role for NBR1 in autophagosomal degradation of ubiquitinated substrates.Autophagy is a catabolic process where cytosolic cellular components are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Recent studies have indicated the existence of specific receptors  such as p62  which link ubiquitinated targets to autophagosomal degradation pathways. Here we show that NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) is an autophagy receptor containing LC3- and ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domains. NBR1 is recruited to Ub-positive protein aggregates and degraded by autophagy depending on an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and LC3 family modifiers. Although NBR1 and p62 interact and form oligomers  they can function independently  as shown by autophagosomal clearance of NBR1 in p62-deficient cells. NBR1 was localized to Ub-positive inclusions in patients with liver dysfunction  and depletion of NBR1 abolished the formation of Ub-positive p62 bodies upon puromycin treatment of cells. We propose that NBR1 and p62 act as receptors for selective autophagosomal degradation of ubiquitinated targets. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural basis of target recognition by Atg8/LC3 during selective autophagy.Autophagy is a non-selective bulk degradation process in which isolation membranes enclose a portion of cytoplasm to form double-membrane vesicles  called autophagosomes  and deliver their inner constituents to the lytic compartments. Recent studies have also shed light on another mode of autophagy that selectively degrades various targets. Yeast Atg8 and its mammalian homologue LC3 are ubiquitin-like modifiers that are localized on isolation membranes and play crucial roles in the formation of autophagosomes. These proteins are also involved in selective incorporation of specific cargo molecules into autophagosomes  in which Atg8 and LC3 interact with Atg19 and p62  receptor proteins for vacuolar enzymes and disease-related protein aggregates  respectively. Using X-ray crystallography and NMR  we herein report the structural basis for Atg8-Atg19 and LC3-p62 interactions. Remarkably  Atg8 and LC3 were shown to interact with Atg19 and p62  respectively  in a quite similar manner: they recognized the side-chains of Trp and Leu in a four-amino acid motif  WXXL  in Atg19 and p62 using hydrophobic pockets conserved among Atg8 homologues. Together with mutational analyses  our results show the fundamental mechanism that allows Atg8 homologues  in association with WXXL-containing proteins  to capture specific cargo molecules  thereby endowing isolation membranes and/or their assembly machineries with target selectivity. ,Autophagy_LIR

Identification of clathrin heavy chain as a direct interaction partner for the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor associated protein.Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA receptors) are the major sites of GABA-mediated fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. Variation of the cell surface receptor count is postulated to be of importance in modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission. The GABAA receptor associated protein (GABARAP) is a ubiquitin-like modifier  implicated in GABAA receptor clustering  trafficking  and turnover. GABARAP pull-down experiments with brain lysate identified clathrin heavy chain to be GABARAP-associated. Phage display screening of a randomized peptide library for GABARAP ligands yielded a sequence motif which characterizes the peptide binding specificity of GABARAP. Sequence database searches with this motif revealed clathrin heavy chain as a protein containing the identified sequence motif within its residues 510-522  supporting the result of the pull-down experiments. Calreticulin  which was identified recently as a GABARAP ligand  contains a very similar sequence motif. We demonstrate that calreticulin indeed competes with clathrin heavy chain for GABARAP binding. Finally  employing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  we mapped the GABARAP residues responsible for binding to clathrin. The hereby mapped GABARAP regions overlap very well with the homologue residues in yeast Atg8 that were recently shown to be important for autophagy. Together with the knowledge that GABARAP and clathrin are known to be involved in GABAA receptor trafficking within the cell  this strongly suggests a clear physiological relevance of the direct interaction of GABARAP with clathrin heavy chain. ,Autophagy_LIR

p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to Atg8/LC3 to facilitate degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates by autophagy.Protein degradation by basal constitutive autophagy is important to avoid accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and development of neurodegenerative diseases. The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 is degraded by autophagy. It is found in cellular inclusion bodies together with polyubiquitinated proteins and in cytosolic protein aggregates that accumulate in various chronic  toxic  and degenerative diseases. Here we show for the first time a direct interaction between p62 and the autophagic effector proteins LC3A and -B and the related gamma-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein and gamma-aminobutyrate receptor-associated-like proteins. The binding is mediated by a 22-residue sequence of p62 containing an evolutionarily conserved motif. To monitor the autophagic sequestration of p62- and LC3-positive bodies  we developed a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent tag consisting of a tandem fusion of the red  acid-insensitive mCherry and the acid-sensitive green fluorescent proteins. This approach revealed that p62- and LC3-positive bodies are degraded in autolysosomes. Strikingly  even rather large p62-positive inclusion bodies (2 microm diameter) become degraded by autophagy. The specific interaction between p62 and LC3  requiring the motif we have mapped  is instrumental in mediating autophagic degradation of the p62-positive bodies. We also demonstrate that the previously reported aggresome-like induced structures containing ubiquitinated proteins in cytosolic bodies are dependent on p62 for their formation. In fact  p62 bodies and these structures are indistinguishable. Taken together  our results clearly suggest that p62 is required both for the formation and the degradation of polyubiquitin-containing bodies by autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural basis of the autophagy-related LC3/Atg13 LIR complex: recognition and interaction mechanism.Autophagy is a bulk degradation pathway that removes cytosolic materials to maintain cellular homeostasis. The autophagy-related gene 13 (Atg13) and microtubule associate protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) proteins are required for autophagosome formation. We demonstrate that each of the human LC3 isoforms (LC3A  LC3B  and LC3C) interacts with Atg13 via the LC3 interacting region (LIR) of Atg13. Using X-ray crystallography  we solved the macromolecular structures of LC3A and LC3C  along with the complex structures of the LC3 isoforms with the Atg13 LIR. Together  our structural and binding analyses reveal that the side-chain of Lys49 of LC3 acts as a gatekeeper to regulate binding of the LIR. We verified this observation by mutation of Lys49 in LC3A  which significantly reduces LC3A positive puncta formation in cultured cells. Our results suggest that specific affinity of the LC3 isoforms to the Atg13 LIR is required for proper autophagosome formation. ,Autophagy_LIR

Role of autophagy in glycogen breakdown and its relevance to chloroquine myopathy.Several myopathies are associated with defects in autophagic and lysosomal degradation of glycogen  but it remains unclear how glycogen is targeted to the lysosome and what significance this process has for muscle cells. We have established a Drosophila melanogaster model to study glycogen autophagy in skeletal muscles  using chloroquine (CQ) to simulate a vacuolar myopathy that is completely dependent on the core autophagy genes. We show that autophagy is required for the most efficient degradation of glycogen in response to starvation. Furthermore  we show that CQ-induced myopathy can be improved by reduction of either autophagy or glycogen synthesis  the latter possibly due to a direct role of Glycogen Synthase in regulating autophagy through its interaction with Atg8. ,Autophagy_LIR

The immune system GTPase GIMAP6 interacts with the Atg8 homologue GABARAPL2 and is recruited to autophagosomes.The GIMAPs (GTPases of the immunity-associated proteins) are a family of small GTPases expressed prominently in the immune systems of mammals and other vertebrates. In mammals  studies of mutant or genetically-modified rodents have indicated important roles for the GIMAP GTPases in the development and survival of lymphocytes. No clear picture has yet emerged  however  of the molecular mechanisms by which they perform their function(s). Using biotin tag-affinity purification we identified a major  and highly specific  interaction between the human cytosolic family member GIMAP6 and GABARAPL2  one of the mammalian homologues of the yeast autophagy protein Atg8. Chemical cross-linking studies performed on Jurkat T cells  which express both GIMAP6 and GABARAPL2 endogenously  indicated that the two proteins in these cells readily associate with one another in the cytosol under normal conditions. The GIMAP6-GABARAPL2 interaction was disrupted by deletion of the last 10 amino acids of GIMAP6. The N-terminal region of GIMAP6  however  which includes a putative Atg8-family interacting motif  was not required. Over-expression of GIMAP6 resulted in increased levels of endogenous GABARAPL2 in cells. After culture of cells in starvation medium  GIMAP6 was found to localise in punctate structures with both GABARAPL2 and the autophagosomal marker MAP1LC3B  indicating that GIMAP6 re-locates to autophagosomes on starvation. Consistent with this finding  we have demonstrated that starvation of Jurkat T cells results in the degradation of GIMAP6. Whilst these findings raise the possibility that the GIMAPs play roles in the regulation of autophagy  we have been unable to demonstrate an effect of GIMAP6 over-expression on autophagic flux. ,Autophagy_LIR

Adaptor complex AP2/PICALM  through interaction with LC3  targets Alzheimer's APP-CTF for terminal degradation via autophagy.The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and tau protein. Autophagy is a major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins. We have reported recently that autophagy was responsible for amyloid precursor protein cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) degradation and amyloid β clearance in an Atg5-dependent manner. Here we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which autophagy mediates the degradation of APP-CTF and the clearance of amyloid β. Through affinity purification followed by mass spectrum analysis  we identified adaptor protein (AP) 2 together with phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) as binding proteins of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Further analysis showed that AP2 regulated the cellular levels of APP-CTF. Knockdown of AP2 reduced autophagy-mediated APP-CTF degradation. Immunoprecipitation and live imaging analysis demonstrated that AP2 and PICALM cross-link LC3 with APP-CTF. These data suggest that the AP-2/PICALM complex functions as an autophagic cargo receptor for the recognition and shipment of APP-CTF from the endocytic pathway to the LC3-marked autophagic degradation pathway. This molecular mechanism linking AP2/PICALM and AD is consistent with genetic evidence indicating a role for PICALM as a risk factor for AD. ,Autophagy_LIR

Membrane remodeling by the PX-BAR protein SNX18 promotes autophagosome formation.The membrane remodeling events required for autophagosome biogenesis are still poorly understood. Because PX domain proteins mediate membrane remodeling and trafficking  we conducted an imaging-based siRNA screen for autophagosome formation targeting human PX proteins. The PX-BAR protein SNX18 was identified as a positive regulator of autophagosome formation  and its Drosophila melanogaster homologue SH3PX1 was found to be required for efficient autophagosome formation in the larval fat body. We show that SNX18 is required for recruitment of Atg16L1-positive recycling endosomes to a perinuclear area and for delivery of Atg16L1- and LC3-positive membranes to autophagosome precursors. We identify a direct interaction of SNX18 with LC3 and show that the pro-autophagic activity of SNX18 depends on its membrane binding and tubulation capacity. We also show that the function of SNX18 in membrane tubulation and autophagy is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of S233. We conclude that SNX18 promotes autophagosome formation by virtue of its ability to remodel membranes and provide membrane to forming autophagosomes. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autolysosomal β-catenin degradation regulates Wnt-autophagy-p62 crosstalk.The Wnt/β-catenin signalling and autophagy pathways each play important roles during development  adult tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Here we identify the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway as a negative regulator of both basal and stress-induced autophagy. Manipulation of β-catenin expression levels in vitro and in vivo revealed that β-catenin suppresses autophagosome formation and directly represses p62/SQSTM1 (encoding the autophagy adaptor p62) via TCF4. Furthermore  we show that during nutrient deprivation β-catenin is selectively degraded via the formation of a β-catenin-LC3 complex  attenuating β-catenin/TCF-driven transcription and proliferation to favour adaptation during metabolic stress. Formation of the β-catenin-LC3 complex is mediated by a W/YXXI/L motif and LC3-interacting region (LIR) in β-catenin  which is required for interaction with LC3 and non-proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Thus  Wnt/β-catenin represses autophagy and p62 expression  while β-catenin is itself targeted for autophagic clearance in autolysosomes upon autophagy induction. These findings reveal a regulatory feedback mechanism that place β-catenin at a key cellular integration point coordinating proliferation with autophagy  with implications for targeting these pathways for cancer therapy. ,Autophagy_LIR

The TBC/RabGAP Armus coordinates Rac1 and Rab7 functions during autophagy.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that enables catabolic and degradative pathways. These pathways commonly depend on vesicular transport controlled by Rabs  small GTPases inactivated by TBC/RabGAPs. The Rac1 effector TBC/RabGAP Armus (TBC1D2A) is known to inhibit Rab7  a key regulator of lysosomal function. However  the precise coordination of signaling and intracellular trafficking that regulates autophagy is poorly understood. We find that overexpression of Armus induces the accumulation of enlarged autophagosomes  while Armus depletion significantly delays autophagic flux. Upon starvation-induced autophagy  Rab7 is transiently activated. This spatiotemporal regulation of Rab7 guanosine triphosphate/guanosine diphosphate cycling occurs by Armus recruitment to autophagosomes via interaction with LC3  a core autophagy regulator. Interestingly  autophagy potently inactivates Rac1. Active Rac1 competes with LC3 for interaction with Armus and thus prevents its appropriate recruitment to autophagosomes. The precise coordination between Rac1 and Rab7 activities during starvation suggests that Armus integrates autophagy with signaling and endocytic trafficking. ,Autophagy_LIR

The scaffold protein EPG-7 links cargo-receptor complexes with the autophagic assembly machinery.The mechanism by which protein aggregates are selectively degraded by autophagy is poorly understood. Previous studies show that a family of Atg8-interacting proteins function as receptors linking specific cargoes to the autophagic machinery. Here we demonstrate that during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis  epg-7 functions as a scaffold protein mediating autophagic degradation of several protein aggregates  including aggregates of the p62 homologue SQST-1  but has little effect on other autophagy-regulated processes. EPG-7 self-oligomerizes and is degraded by autophagy independently of SQST-1. SQST-1 directly interacts with EPG-7 and colocalizes with EPG-7 aggregates in autophagy mutants. Mutations in epg-7 impair association of SQST-1 aggregates with LGG-1/Atg8 puncta. EPG-7 interacts with multiple ATG proteins and colocalizes with ATG-9 puncta in various autophagy mutants. Unlike core autophagy genes  epg-7 is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagic degradation of substrate aggregates. Our results indicate that under physiological conditions a scaffold protein endows cargo specificity and also elevates degradation efficiency by linking the cargo-receptor complex with the autophagic machinery. ,Autophagy_LIR

TBK1 kinase addiction in lung cancer cells is mediated via autophagy of Tax1bp1/Ndp52 and non-canonical NF-κB signalling.K-Ras dependent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are 'addicted' to basal autophagy that reprograms cellular metabolism in a lysosomal-sensitive manner. Here we demonstrate that the xenophagy-associated kinase TBK1 drives basal autophagy  consistent with its known requirement in K-Ras-dependent NSCLC proliferation. Furthermore  basal autophagy in this context is characterised by sequestration of the xenophagy cargo receptor Ndp52 and its paralogue Tax1bp1  which we demonstrate here to be a bona fide cargo receptor. Autophagy of these cargo receptors promotes non-canonical NF-κB signalling. We propose that this TBK1-dependent mechanism for NF-κB signalling contributes to autophagy addiction in K-Ras driven NSCLC. ,Autophagy_LIR

Modulation of serines 17 and 24 in the LC3-interacting region of Bnip3 determines pro-survival mitophagy versus apoptosis.BH3-only proteins integrate apoptosis and autophagy pathways  yet regulation and functional consequences of pathway cross-talk are not fully resolved. The BH3-only protein Bnip3 is an autophagy receptor that signals autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy) via interaction of its LC3-interacting region (LIR) with Atg8 proteins. Here we report that phosphorylation of serine residues 17 and 24 flanking the Bnip3 LIR promotes binding to specific Atg8 members LC3B and GATE-16. Using quantitative multispectral image-based flow cytometry  we demonstrate that enhancing Bnip3-Atg8 interactions via phosphorylation-mimicked LIR mutations increased mitochondrial sequestration  lysosomal delivery  and degradation. Importantly  mitochondria were targeted by mitophagy prior to cytochrome c release  resulting in reduced cellular cytochrome c release capacity. Intriguingly  pro-survival Bcl-x(L) positively regulated Bnip3 binding to LC3B  sequestration  and mitochondrial autophagy  further supporting an anti-apoptotic role for Bnip3-induced mitophagy. The ensemble of these results demonstrates that the phosphorylation state of the Bnip3 LIR signals either the induction of apoptosis or pro-survival mitophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

ATG8 family proteins act as scaffolds for assembly of the ULK complex: sequence requirements for LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs.Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation system conserved among eukaryotes. The mammalian Atg1 homologues  Unc-51 like kinase (ULK) 1 and 2  are multifunctional proteins with roles in autophagy  neurite outgrowth  and vesicle transport. The mammalian ULK complex involved in autophagy consists of ULK1  ULK2  ATG13  FIP200  and ATG101. We have used pulldown and peptide array overlay assays to study interactions between the ULK complex and six different ATG8 family proteins. Strikingly  in addition to ULK1 and ULK2  ATG13 and FIP200 interacted with human ATG8 proteins  all with strong preference for the GABARAP subfamily. Similarly  yeast and Drosophila Atg1 interacted with their respective Atg8 proteins  demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of the interaction. Use of peptide arrays allowed precise mapping of the functional LIR motifs  and two-dimensional scans of the ULK1 and ATG13 LIR motifs revealed which substitutions that were tolerated. This information  combined with an analysis of known LIR motifs  provides us with a clearer picture of sequence requirements for LIR motifs. In addition to the known requirements of the aromatic and hydrophobic residues of the core motif  we found the interactions to depend strongly on acidic residues surrounding the central core LIR motifs. A preference for either a hydrophobic residue or an acidic residue following the aromatic residue in the LIR motif is also evident. Importantly  the LIR motif is required for starvation-induced association of ULK1 with autophagosomes. Our data suggest that ATG8 proteins act as scaffolds for assembly of the ULK complex at the phagophore. ,Autophagy_LIR

LC3C  bound selectively by a noncanonical LIR motif in NDP52  is required for antibacterial autophagy.Autophagy protects cellular homeostasis by capturing cytosolic components and invading pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy receptors target cargo to autophagy by binding ATG8 on autophagosomal membranes. The expansion of the ATG8 family in higher eukaryotes suggests that specific interactions with autophagy receptors facilitate differential cargo handling. However  selective interactors of ATG8 orthologs are unknown. Here we show that the selectivity of the autophagy receptor NDP52 for LC3C is crucial for innate immunity since cells lacking either protein cannot protect their cytoplasm against Salmonella. LC3C is required for antibacterial autophagy because in its absence the remaining ATG8 orthologs do not support efficient antibacterial autophagy. Structural analysis revealed that the selectivity of NDP52 for LC3C is conferred by a noncanonical LIR  in which lack of an aromatic residue is balanced by LC3C-specific interactions. Our report illustrates that specificity in the interaction between autophagy receptors and autophagy machinery is of functional importance to execute selective autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural characterization and inhibition of the Plasmodium Atg8-Atg3 interaction.The autophagy-related proteins are thought to serve multiple functions in Plasmodium and are considered essential to parasite survival and development. We have studied two key interacting proteins  Atg8 and Atg3  of the autophagy pathway in Plasmodium falciparum. These proteins are vital for the formation and elongation of the autophagosome and essential to the process of macroautophagy. Autophagy may be required for conversion of the sporozoite into erythrocytic-infective merozoites and may be crucial for other functions during asexual blood stages. Here we describe the identification of an Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Plasmodium Atg3  which binds Plasmodium Atg8. We determined the co-crystal structure of PfAtg8 with a short Atg3¹⁰³⁻¹¹⁰ peptide  corresponding to this motif  to 2.2 Å resolution. Our in vitro interaction studies are in agreement with our X-ray crystal structure. Furthermore they suggest an important role for a unique Apicomplexan loop absent from human Atg8 homologues. Prevention of the protein-protein interaction of full length PfAtg8 with PfAtg3 was achieved at low micromolar concentrations with a small molecule  1 2 3-trihydroxybenzene. Together our structural and interaction studies represent a starting point for future antimalarial drug discovery and design for this novel protein-protein interaction. ,Autophagy_LIR

MAPK15/ERK8 stimulates autophagy by interacting with LC3 and GABARAP proteins.Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process necessary for normal recycling of cellular constituents and for appropriate response to cellular stress. Although several genes belonging to the core molecular machinery involved in autophagosome formation have been discovered  relatively little is known about the nature of signaling networks controlling autophagy upon intracellular or extracellular stimuli. We discovered ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B  GABARAP and GABARAPL1) as novel interactors of MAPK15/ERK8  a MAP kinase involved in cell proliferation and transformation. Based on the role of these proteins in the autophagic process  we demonstrated that MAPK15 is indeed localized to autophagic compartments and increased  in a kinase-dependent fashion  ATG8-like proteins lipidation  autophagosome formation and SQSTM1 degradation  while decreasing LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation. Interestingly  we also identified a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in MAPK15 responsible for its interaction with ATG8-like proteins  for its localization to autophagic structures and  consequently  for stimulation of the formation of these compartments. Furthermore  we reveal that MAPK15 activity was induced in response to serum and amino-acid starvation and that this stimulus  in turn  required endogenous MAPK15 expression to induce the autophagic process. Altogether  these results suggested a new function for MAPK15 as a regulator of autophagy  acting through interaction with ATG8 family proteins. Also  based on the key role of this process in several human diseases  these results supported the use of this MAP kinase as a potential novel therapeutic target. ,Autophagy_LIR

Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Peroxisomes undergo rapid  selective autophagic degradation (pexophagy) when the metabolic pathways they contain are no longer required for cellular metabolism. Pex3 is central to the formation of peroxisomes and their segregation because it recruits factors specific for these functions. Here  we describe a novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that interacts with Pex3 at the peroxisomal membrane. We name this protein Atg36 as its absence blocks pexophagy  and its overexpression induces pexophagy. We have isolated pex3 alleles blocked specifically in pexophagy that cannot recruit Atg36 to peroxisomes. Atg36 is recruited to mitochondria if Pex3 is redirected there  where it restores mitophagy in cells lacking the mitophagy receptor Atg32. Furthermore  Atg36 binds Atg8 and the adaptor Atg11 that links receptors for selective types of autophagy to the core autophagy machinery. Atg36 delivers peroxisomes to the preautophagosomal structure before being internalised into the vacuole with peroxisomes. We conclude that Pex3 recruits the pexophagy receptor Atg36. This reinforces the pivotal role played by Pex3 in coordinating the size of the peroxisome pool  and establishes its role in pexophagy in S. cerevisiae. ,Autophagy_LIR

Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) interacts with Bnip3 protein to selectively remove endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria via autophagy.Autophagy plays an important role in cellular quality control and is responsible for removing protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles. Bnip3 is an atypical BH3-only protein that is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Interestingly  Bnip3 can also protect against cell death by inducing mitochondrial autophagy. The mechanism for this process  however  remains poorly understood. Bnip3 contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is essential for homodimerization and proapoptotic function. In this study  we show that homodimerization of Bnip3 is also a requirement for induction of autophagy. Several Bnip3 mutants that do not interfere with its mitochondrial localization but disrupt homodimerization failed to induce autophagy in cells. In addition  we discovered that endogenous Bnip3 is localized to both mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To investigate the effects of Bnip3 at mitochondria or the ER on autophagy  Bnip3 was targeted specifically to each organelle by substituting the Bnip3 transmembrane domain with that of Acta or cytochrome b(5). We found that Bnip3 enhanced autophagy in cells from both sites. We also discovered that Bnip3 induced removal of both ER (ERphagy) and mitochondria (mitophagy) via autophagy. The clearance of these organelles was mediated in part via binding of Bnip3 to LC3 on the autophagosome. Although ablation of the Bnip3-LC3 interaction by mutating the LC3 binding site did not impair the prodeath activity of Bnip3  it significantly reduced both mitophagy and ERphagy. Our data indicate that Bnip3 regulates the apoptotic balance as an autophagy receptor that induces removal of both mitochondria and ER. ,Autophagy_LIR

TP53INP1  a tumor suppressor  interacts with LC3 and ATG8-family proteins through the LC3-interacting region (LIR) and promotes autophagy-dependent cell death.TP53INP1 (tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1) is a tumor suppressor  whose expression is downregulated in cancers from different organs. It was described as a p53 target gene involved in cell death  cell-cycle arrest and cellular migration. In this work  we show that TP53INP1 is also able to interact with ATG8-family proteins and to induce autophagy-dependent cell death. In agreement with this finding  we observe that TP53INP1  which is mainly nuclear  relocalizes in autophagosomes during autophagy where it is eventually degraded. TP53INP1-LC3 interaction occurs via a functional LC3-interacting region (LIR). Inactivating mutations of this sequence abolish TP53INP1-LC3 interaction  relocalize TP53INP1 in autophagosomes and decrease TP53INP1 ability to trigger cell death. Interestingly  TP53INP1 binds to ATG8-family proteins with higher affinity than p62  suggesting that it could partially displace p62 from autophagosomes  modifying thereby their composition. Moreover  silencing the expression of autophagy related genes (ATG5 or Beclin-1) or inhibiting caspase activity significantly decreases cell death induced by TP53INP1. These data indicate that cell death observed after TP53INP1-LC3 interaction depends on both autophagy and caspase activity. We conclude that TP53INP1 could act as a tumor suppressor by inducing cell death by caspase-dependent autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Rab GTPase-activating proteins in autophagy: regulation of endocytic and autophagy pathways by direct binding to human ATG8 modifiers.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation pathway characterized by dynamic rearrangement of membranes that sequester cytoplasm  protein aggregates  organelles  and pathogens for delivery to the vacuole and lysosome  respectively. The ability of autophagosomal membranes to act selectively toward specific cargo is dependent on the small ubiquitin-like modifier ATG8/LC3 and the LC3-interacting region (LIR) present in autophagy receptors. Here  we describe a comprehensive protein-protein interaction analysis of TBC (Tre2  Bub2  and Cdc16) domain-containing Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) as potential autophagy adaptors. We identified 14 TBC domain-containing Rab GAPs that bind directly to ATG8 modifiers and that colocalize with LC3-positive autophagy membranes in cells. Intriguingly  one of our screening hits  TBC1D5  contains two LIR motifs. The N-terminal LIR was critical for interaction with the retromer complex and transport of cargo. Direct binding of the retromer component VPS29 to TBC1D5 could be titrated out by LC3  indicating a molecular switch between endosomes and autophagy. Moreover  TBC1D5 could bridge the endosome and autophagosome via its C-terminal LIR motif. During starvation-induced autophagy  TBC1D5 was relocalized from endosomal localization to the LC3-positive autophagosomes. We propose that LC3-interacting Rab GAPs are implicated in the reprogramming of the endocytic trafficking events under starvation-induced autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mitochondrial outer-membrane protein FUNDC1 mediates hypoxia-induced mitophagy in mammalian cells.Accumulating evidence has shown that dysfunctional mitochondria can be selectively removed by mitophagy. Dysregulation of mitophagy is implicated in the development of neurodegenerative disease and metabolic disorders. How individual mitochondria are recognized for removal and how this process is regulated remain poorly understood. Here we report that FUNDC1  an integral mitochondrial outer-membrane protein  is a receptor for hypoxia-induced mitophagy. FUNDC1 interacted with LC3 through its typical LC3-binding motif Y(18)xxL(21)  and mutation of the LC3-interaction region impaired its interaction with LC3 and the subsequent induction of mitophagy. Knockdown of endogenous FUNDC1 significantly prevented hypoxia-induced mitophagy  which could be reversed by the expression of wild-type FUNDC1  but not LC3-interaction-deficient FUNDC1 mutants. Mechanistic studies further revealed that hypoxia induced dephosphorylation of FUNDC1 and enhanced its interaction with LC3 for selective mitophagy. Our findings thus offer insights into mitochondrial quality control in mammalian cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy in the CNS and Periphery Coordinate Lipophagy and Lipolysis in the Brown Adipose Tissue and Liver.The integrative physiology of inter-organ communication in lipophagy regulation is not well understood. Lipophagy and the cytosolic lipases ATGL and HSL contribute to lipid droplet (LD) mobilization; however  whether autophagy proteins engage with lipases to promote lipid utilization remains unknown. Here  we show that cold induces autophagy in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and activates lipophagy in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver in mice. Targeted activation of autophagy in POMC neurons via intra-hypothalamic rapamycin is sufficient to trigger lipid utilization in room temperature-housed mice. Conversely  inhibiting autophagy in POMC neurons or in peripheral tissues or denervating BAT blocks lipid utilization. Unexpectedly  the autophagosome marker LC3 is mechanistically coupled to ATGL-mediated lipolysis. ATGL exhibits LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs  and mutating a single LIR motif on ATGL displaces ATGL from LD and disrupts lipolysis. Thus  cold-induced activation of central autophagy activates lipophagy and cytosolic lipases in a complementary manner to mediate lipolysis in peripheral tissues. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural Basis of the Differential Function of the Two C. elegans Atg8 Homologs  LGG-1 and LGG-2  in Autophagy.Multicellular organisms have multiple homologs of the yeast ATG8 gene  but the differential roles of these homologs in autophagy during development remain largely unknown. Here we investigated structure/function relationships in the two C. elegans Atg8 homologs  LGG-1 and LGG-2. lgg-1 is essential for degradation of protein aggregates  while lgg-2 has cargo-specific and developmental-stage-specific roles in aggregate degradation. Crystallography revealed that the N-terminal tails of LGG-1 and LGG-2 adopt the closed and open form  respectively. LGG-1 and LGG-2 interact differentially with autophagy substrates and Atg proteins  many of which carry a LIR motif. LGG-1 and LGG-2 have structurally distinct substrate binding pockets that prefer different residues in the interacting LIR motif  thus influencing binding specificity. Lipidated LGG-1 and LGG-2 possess distinct membrane tethering and fusion activities  which may result from the N-terminal differences. Our study reveals the differential function of two ATG8 homologs in autophagy during C. elegans development. ,Autophagy_LIR

FYCO1 Contains a C-terminally Extended  LC3A/B-preferring LC3-interacting Region (LIR) Motif Required for Efficient Maturation of Autophagosomes during Basal Autophagy.FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled-coil protein 1) is a transport adaptor that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate  to Rab7  and to LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) to mediate transport of late endosomes and autophagosomes along microtubules in the plus end direction. We have previously shown that FYCO1 binds to LC3B via a 19-amino acid sequence containing a putative core LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. Here  we show that FYCO1 preferentially binds to LC3A and -B. By peptide array-based two-dimensional mutational scans of the binding to LC3B  we found FYCO1 to contain a C-terminally extended LIR domain. We determined the crystal structure of a complex between a 13-amino acid LIR peptide from FYCO1 and LC3B at 1.53 Å resolution. By combining the structural information with mutational analyses  both the basis for the C-terminally extended LIR and the specificity for LC3A/B binding were revealed. FYCO1 contains a 9-amino acid-long F-type LIR motif. In addition to the canonical aromatic residue at position 1 and the hydrophobic residue at position 3  an acidic residue and a hydrophobic residue at positions 8 and 9  respectively  are important for efficient binding to LC3B explaining the C-terminal extension. The specificity for binding to LC3A/B is due to the interaction between Asp(1285) in FYCO1 and His(57) in LC3B. To address the functional significance of the LIR motif of FYCO1  we generated FYCO1 knock-out cells that subsequently were reconstituted with GFP-FYCO1 WT and LIR mutant constructs. Our data show that FYCO1 requires a functional LIR motif to facilitate efficient maturation of autophagosomes under basal conditions  whereas starvation-induced autophagy was unaffected. ,Autophagy_LIR

The Autophagy Receptor TAX1BP1 and the Molecular Motor Myosin VI Are Required for Clearance of Salmonella Typhimurium by Autophagy.Autophagy plays a key role during Salmonella infection  by eliminating these pathogens following escape into the cytosol. In this process  selective autophagy receptors  including the myosin VI adaptor proteins optineurin and NDP52  have been shown to recognize cytosolic pathogens. Here  we demonstrate that myosin VI and TAX1BP1 are recruited to ubiquitylated Salmonella and play a key role in xenophagy. The absence of TAX1BP1 causes an accumulation of ubiquitin-positive Salmonella  whereas loss of myosin VI leads to an increase in ubiquitylated and LC3-positive bacteria. Our structural studies demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding site of TAX1BP1 overlaps with the myosin VI binding site and point mutations in the TAX1BP1 zinc finger domains that affect ubiquitin binding also ablate binding to myosin VI. This mutually exclusive binding and the association of TAX1BP1 with LC3 on the outer limiting membrane of autophagosomes may suggest a molecular mechanism for recruitment of this motor to autophagosomes. The predominant role of TAX1BP1  a paralogue of NDP52  in xenophagy is supported by our evolutionary analysis  which demonstrates that functionally intact NDP52 is missing in Xenopus and mice  whereas TAX1BP1 is expressed in all vertebrates analysed. In summary  this work highlights the importance of TAX1BP1 as a novel autophagy receptor in myosin VI-mediated xenophagy. Our study identifies essential new machinery for the autophagy-dependent clearance of Salmonella typhimurium and suggests modulation of myosin VI motor activity as a potential therapeutic target in cellular immunity. ,Autophagy_LIR

TECPR2 Cooperates with LC3C to Regulate COPII-Dependent ER Export.Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by axonopathy of the corticospinal motor neurons. A mutation in the gene encoding for Tectonin β-propeller containing protein 2 (TECPR2) causes HSP that is complicated by neurological symptoms. While TECPR2 is a human ATG8 binding protein and positive regulator of autophagy  the exact function of TECPR2 is unknown. Here  we show that TECPR2 associates with several trafficking components  among them the COPII coat protein SEC24D. TECPR2 is required for stabilization of SEC24D protein levels  maintenance of functional ER exit sites (ERES)  and efficient ER export in a manner dependent on binding to lipidated LC3C. TECPR2-deficient HSP patient cells display alterations in SEC24D abundance and ER export efficiency. Additionally  TECPR2 and LC3C are required for autophagosome formation  possibly through maintaining functional ERES. Collectively  these results reveal that TECPR2 functions as molecular scaffold linking early secretion pathway and autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

TRIM-mediated precision autophagy targets cytoplasmic regulators of innate immunity.The present paradigms of selective autophagy in mammalian cells cannot fully explain the specificity and selectivity of autophagic degradation. In this paper  we report that a subset of tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins act as specialized receptors for highly specific autophagy (precision autophagy) of key components of the inflammasome and type I interferon response systems. TRIM20 targets the inflammasome components  including NLRP3  NLRP1  and pro-caspase 1  for autophagic degradation  whereas TRIM21 targets IRF3. TRIM20 and TRIM21 directly bind their respective cargo and recruit autophagic machinery to execute degradation. The autophagic function of TRIM20 is affected by mutations associated with familial Mediterranean fever. These findings broaden the concept of TRIMs acting as autophagic receptor regulators executing precision autophagy of specific cytoplasmic targets. In the case of TRIM20 and TRIM21  precision autophagy controls the hub signaling machineries and key factors  inflammasome and type I interferon  directing cardinal innate immunity response systems in humans. ,Autophagy_LIR

Bcl-2-like protein 13 is a mammalian Atg32 homologue that mediates mitophagy and mitochondrial fragmentation.Damaged mitochondria are removed by mitophagy. Although Atg32 is essential for mitophagy in yeast  no Atg32 homologue has been identified in mammalian cells. Here  we show that Bcl-2-like protein 13 (Bcl2-L-13) induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy in mammalian cells. First  we hypothesized that unidentified mammalian mitophagy receptors would share molecular features of Atg32. By screening the public protein database for Atg32 homologues  we identify Bcl2-L-13. Bcl2-L-13 binds to LC3 through the WXXI motif and induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy in HEK293 cells. In Bcl2-L-13  the BH domains are important for the fragmentation  while the WXXI motif facilitates mitophagy. Bcl2-L-13 induces mitochondrial fragmentation in the absence of Drp1  while it induces mitophagy in Parkin-deficient cells. Knockdown of Bcl2-L-13 attenuates mitochondrial damage-induced fragmentation and mitophagy. Bcl2-L-13 induces mitophagy in Atg32-deficient yeast cells.

Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum turnover by selective autophagy.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular endomembrane system  enabling protein and lipid synthesis  ion homeostasis  quality control of newly synthesized proteins and organelle communication. Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process. However  its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP  and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER  while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently  disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER  inhibits ER turnover  sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore  selective ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans. ,Autophagy_LIR

Receptor-mediated selective autophagy degrades the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus.Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) degrades various intracellular constituents to regulate a wide range of cellular functions  and is also closely linked to several human diseases. In selective autophagy  receptor proteins recognize degradation targets and direct their sequestration by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes  which transport them into lysosomes or vacuoles. Although recent studies have shown that selective autophagy is involved in quality/quantity control of some organelles  including mitochondria and peroxisomes  it remains unclear how extensively it contributes to cellular organelle homeostasis. Here we describe selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify two novel proteins  Atg39 and Atg40  as receptors specific to these pathways. Atg39 localizes to the perinuclear ER (or the nuclear envelope) and induces autophagic sequestration of part of the nucleus. Atg40 is enriched in the cortical and cytoplasmic ER  and loads these ER subdomains into autophagosomes. Atg39-dependent autophagy of the perinuclear ER/nucleus is required for cell survival under nitrogen-deprivation conditions. Atg40 is probably the functional counterpart of FAM134B  an autophagy receptor for the ER in mammals that has been implicated in sensory neuropathy. Our results provide fundamental insight into the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms of 'ER-phagy' and 'nucleophagy' in other organisms. ,Autophagy_LIR

p62/Sequestosome-1  Autophagy-related Gene 8  and Autophagy in Drosophila Are Regulated by Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related Factor 2 (NRF2)  Independent of Transcription Factor TFEB.The selective autophagy receptor p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) interacts directly with LC3 and is involved in oxidative stress signaling in two ways in mammals. First  p62 is transcriptionally induced upon oxidative stress by the NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) by direct binding to an antioxidant response element in the p62 promoter. Second  p62 accumulation  occurring when autophagy is impaired  leads to increased p62 binding to the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1  resulting in reduced proteasomal turnover of NRF2. This gives chronic oxidative stress signaling through a feed forward loop. Here  we show that the Drosophila p62/SQSTM1 orthologue  Ref(2)P  interacts directly with DmAtg8a via an LC3-interacting region motif  supporting a role for Ref(2)P in selective autophagy. The ref(2)P promoter also contains a functional antioxidant response element that is directly bound by the NRF2 orthologue  CncC  which can induce ref(2)P expression along with the oxidative stress-associated gene gstD1. However  distinct from the situation in mammals  Ref(2)P does not interact directly with DmKeap1 via a KEAP1-interacting region motif; nor does ectopically expressed Ref(2)P or autophagy deficiency activate the oxidative stress response. Instead  DmAtg8a interacts directly with DmKeap1  and DmKeap1 is removed upon programmed autophagy in Drosophila gut cells. Strikingly  CncC induced increased Atg8a levels and autophagy independent of TFEB/MitF in fat body and larval gut tissues. Thus  these results extend the intimate relationship between oxidative stress-sensing NRF2/CncC transcription factors and autophagy and suggest that NRF2/CncC may regulate autophagic activity in other organisms too. ,Autophagy_LIR

Coordination of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis during ageing in C. elegans.Impaired mitochondrial maintenance in disparate cell types is a shared hallmark of many human pathologies and ageing. How mitochondrial biogenesis coordinates with the removal of damaged or superfluous mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis is not well understood. Here we show that mitophagy  a selective type of autophagy targeting mitochondria for degradation  interfaces with mitochondrial biogenesis to regulate mitochondrial content and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that DCT-1 is a key mediator of mitophagy and longevity assurance under conditions of stress in C. elegans. Impairment of mitophagy compromises stress resistance and triggers mitochondrial retrograde signalling through the SKN-1 transcription factor that regulates both mitochondrial biogenesis genes and mitophagy by enhancing DCT-1 expression. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback loop that integrates metabolic signals to coordinate the biogenesis and turnover of mitochondria. Uncoupling of these two processes during ageing contributes to overproliferation of damaged mitochondria and decline of cellular function. ,Autophagy_LIR

CUL3-KBTBD6/KBTBD7 ubiquitin ligase cooperates with GABARAP proteins to spatially restrict TIAM1-RAC1 signaling.The small Rho GTPase RAC1 is an essential regulator of cellular signaling that controls actin rearrangements and cell motility. Here  we identify a novel CUL3 RING ubiquitin ligase complex  containing the substrate adaptors KBTBD6 and KBTBD7  that mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of TIAM1  a RAC1-specific GEF. Increasing the abundance of TIAM1 by depletion of KBTBD6 and/or KBTBD7 leads to elevated RAC1 activity  changes in actin morphology  loss of focal adhesions  reduced proliferation  and enhanced invasion. KBTBD6 and KBTBD7 employ ATG8 family-interacting motifs to bind preferentially to GABARAP proteins. Surprisingly  ubiquitylation and degradation of TIAM1 by CUL3(KBTBD6/KBTBD7) depends on its binding to GABARAP proteins. Our study reveals that recruitment of CUL3(KBTBD6/KBTBD7) to GABARAP-containing vesicles regulates the abundance of membrane-associated TIAM1 and subsequently spatially restricted RAC1 signaling. Besides their role in autophagy and trafficking  we uncovered a previously unknown function of GABARAP proteins as membrane-localized signaling scaffolds. ,Autophagy_LIR

Clusterin facilitates stress-induced lipidation of LC3 and autophagosome biogenesis to enhance cancer cell survival.We define stress-induced adaptive survival pathways linking autophagy with the molecular chaperone clusterin (CLU) that function to promote anticancer treatment resistance. During treatment stress  CLU co-localizes with LC3 via an LIR-binding sequence within autophagosome membranes  functioning to facilitate LC3-Atg3 heterocomplex stability and LC3 lipidation  and thereby enhance autophagosome biogenesis and autophagy activation. Stress-induced autophagy is attenuated with CLU silencing in CLU(-/-) mice and human prostate cancer cells. CLU-enhanced cell survival occurs via autophagy-dependent pathways  and is reduced following autophagy inhibition. Combining CLU inhibition with anticancer treatments attenuates autophagy activation  increases apoptosis and reduces prostate cancer growth. This study defines a novel adaptor protein function for CLU under stress conditions  and highlights how co-targeting CLU and autophagy can amplify proteotoxic stress to delay cancer progression. ,Autophagy_LIR

PLEKHM1 regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion through HOPS complex and LC3/GABARAP proteins.The lysosome is the final destination for degradation of endocytic cargo  plasma membrane constituents  and intracellular components sequestered by macroautophagy. Fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with the lysosome depends on the GTPase Rab7 and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex  but adaptor proteins that link endocytic and autophagy pathways with lysosomes are poorly characterized. Herein  we show that Pleckstrin homology domain containing protein family member 1 (PLEKHM1) directly interacts with HOPS complex and contains a LC3-interacting region (LIR) that mediates its binding to autophagosomal membranes. Depletion of PLEKHM1 blocks lysosomal degradation of endocytic (EGFR) cargo and enhances presentation of MHC class I molecules. Moreover  genetic loss of PLEKHM1 impedes autophagy flux upon mTOR inhibition and PLEKHM1 regulates clearance of protein aggregates in an autophagy- and LIR-dependent manner. PLEKHM1 is thus a multivalent endocytic adaptor involved in the lysosome fusion events controlling selective and nonselective autophagy pathways. ,Autophagy_LIR

HIV-1 viral infectivity factor interacts with microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 and inhibits autophagy.Autophagy  an important antiviral process triggered during HIV-1 entry by gp41-dependent membrane fusion  is repressed in infected CD4+ T cells by an unknown mechanism. The aim of this study was to identify the role of viral infectivity factor (Vif) in the autophagy blockade. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mulan E3 ubiquitin ligase interacts with multiple E2 conjugating enzymes and participates in mitophagy by recruiting GABARAP.Mulan is an E3 ubiquitin ligase embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) with its RING finger facing the cytoplasm and a large domain located in the intermembrane space (IMS). Mulan is known to have an important role in cell growth  cell death  and more recently in mitophagy. The mechanism of its function is poorly understood; but as an E3 ligase it is expected to interact with specific E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and these complexes will bind and ubiquitinate specific substrates. The unique topology of Mulan can provide a direct link of communicating mitochondrial signals to the cytoplasm. Our studies identified four different E2 conjugating enzymes (Ube2E2  Ube2E3  Ube2G2 and Ube2L3) as specific interactors of Mulan. Each of these E2 conjugating enzymes was fused to the RING finger domain of Mulan and used in a modified yeast two-hybrid screen. Several unique interactors for each Mulan-E2 complex were isolated. One such specific interactor of Mulan-Ube2E3 was the GABARAP (GABAA receptor-associated protein). GABARAP is a member of the Atg8 family of proteins that plays a major role in autophagy/mitophagy. The interaction of GABARAP with Mulan-Ube2E3 required an LC3-interacting region (LIR) located in the RING finger domain of Mulan as well as the presence of Ube2E3. The isolation of four different E2 conjugating enzymes  as specific partners of Mulan E3 ligase  suggests that Mulan is involved in multiple biological pathways. In addition  the interaction of GABARAP with Mulan-Ube2E3 supports the role of Mulan as an important regulator of mitophagy and provides a plausible mechanism for its function in this process. ,Autophagy_LIR

AMBRA1 is able to induce mitophagy via LC3 binding  regardless of PARKIN and p62/SQSTM1.Damaged mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy  a selective form of autophagy whose dysfunction associates with neurodegenerative diseases. PINK1  PARKIN and p62/SQTMS1 have been shown to regulate mitophagy  leaving hitherto ill-defined the contribution by key players in 'general' autophagy. In basal conditions  a pool of AMBRA1 - an upstream autophagy regulator and a PARKIN interactor - is present at the mitochondria  where its pro-autophagic activity is inhibited by Bcl-2. Here we show that  upon mitophagy induction  AMBRA1 binds the autophagosome adapter LC3 through a LIR (LC3 interacting region) motif  this interaction being crucial for regulating both canonical PARKIN-dependent and -independent mitochondrial clearance. Moreover  forcing AMBRA1 localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane unleashes a massive PARKIN- and p62-independent but LC3-dependent mitophagy. These results highlight a novel role for AMBRA1 as a powerful mitophagy regulator  through both canonical or noncanonical pathways. ,Autophagy_LIR

TRIM proteins regulate autophagy and can target autophagic substrates by direct recognition.Autophagy  a homeostatic process whereby eukaryotic cells target cytoplasmic cargo for degradation  plays a broad role in health and disease states. Here we screened the TRIM family for roles in autophagy and found that half of TRIMs modulated autophagy. In mechanistic studies  we show that TRIMs associate with autophagy factors and act as platforms assembling ULK1 and Beclin 1 in their activated states. Furthermore  TRIM5α acts as a selective autophagy receptor. Based on direct sequence-specific recognition  TRIM5α delivered its cognate cytosolic target  a viral capsid protein  for autophagic degradation. Thus  our study establishes that TRIMs can function both as regulators of autophagy and as autophagic cargo receptors  and reveals a basis for selective autophagy in mammalian cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagic clearance of polyQ proteins mediated by ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors of the conserved CUET protein family.Selective ubiquitin-dependent autophagy plays a pivotal role in the elimination of protein aggregates  assemblies  or organelles and counteracts the cytotoxicity of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Following substrate ubiquitylation  the cargo is delivered to autophagosomes involving adaptors like human p62 that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosomal ubiquitin-like protein Atg8/LC3; however  whether similar pathways exist in lower eukaryotes remained unclear. Here  we identify by a screen in yeast a new class of ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors termed CUET proteins  comprising the ubiquitin-binding CUE-domain protein Cue5 from yeast and its human homolog Tollip. Cue5 collaborates with Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase  and the corresponding yeast mutants accumulate aggregation-prone proteins and are vulnerable to polyQ protein expression. Similarly  Tollip depletion causes cytotoxicity toward polyQ proteins  whereas Tollip overexpression clears human cells from Huntington's disease-linked polyQ proteins by autophagy. We thus propose that CUET proteins play a critical and ancient role in autophagic clearance of cytotoxic protein aggregates. ,Autophagy_LIR

LC3 binding to the scaffolding protein JIP1 regulates processive dynein-driven transport of autophagosomes.Autophagy is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in neurons  where autophagosomes undergo robust unidirectional retrograde transport along axons. We find that the motor scaffolding protein JIP1 binds directly to the autophagosome adaptor LC3 via a conserved LIR motif. This interaction is required for the initial exit of autophagosomes from the distal axon  for sustained retrograde transport along the midaxon  and for autophagosomal maturation in the proximal axon. JIP1 binds directly to the dynein activator dynactin but also binds to and activates kinesin-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Following JIP1 depletion  phosphodeficient JIP1-S421A rescues retrograde transport  while phosphomimetic JIP1-S421D aberrantly activates anterograde transport. During normal autophagosome transport  residue S421 of JIP1 may be maintained in a dephosphorylated state by autophagosome-associated MKP1 phosphatase. Moreover  binding of LC3 to JIP1 competitively disrupts JIP1-mediated activation of kinesin. Thus  dual mechanisms prevent aberrant activation of kinesin to ensure robust retrograde transport of autophagosomes along the axon. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural determinants in GABARAP required for the selective binding and recruitment of ALFY to LC3B-positive structures.Several autophagy proteins contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR) responsible for their interaction with Atg8 homolog proteins. Here  we show that ALFY binds selectively to LC3C and the GABARAPs through a LIR in its WD40 domain. Binding of ALFY to GABARAP is indispensable for its recruitment to LC3B-positive structures and  thus  for the clearance of certain p62 structures by autophagy. In addition  the crystal structure of the GABARAP-ALFY-LIR peptide complex identifies three conserved residues in the GABARAPs that are responsible for binding to ALFY. Interestingly  introduction of these residues in LC3B is sufficient to enable its interaction with ALFY  indicating that residues outside the LIR-binding hydrophobic pockets confer specificity to the interactions with Atg8 homolog proteins. ,Autophagy_LIR

iLIR: A web resource for prediction of Atg8-family interacting proteins.Macroautophagy was initially considered to be a nonselective process for bulk breakdown of cytosolic material. However  recent evidence points toward a selective mode of autophagy mediated by the so-called selective autophagy receptors (SARs). SARs act by recognizing and sorting diverse cargo substrates (e.g.  proteins  organelles  pathogens) to the autophagic machinery. Known SARs are characterized by a short linear sequence motif (LIR-  LRS-  or AIM-motif) responsible for the interaction between SARs and proteins of the Atg8 family. Interestingly  many LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs) are also involved in autophagosome formation and maturation and a few of them in regulating signaling pathways. Despite recent research efforts to experimentally identify LIRCPs  only a few dozen of this class of-often unrelated-proteins have been characterized so far using tedious cell biological  biochemical  and crystallographic approaches. The availability of an ever-increasing number of complete eukaryotic genomes provides a grand challenge for characterizing novel LIRCPs throughout the eukaryotes. Along these lines  we developed iLIR  a freely available web resource  which provides in silico tools for assisting the identification of novel LIRCPs. Given an amino acid sequence as input  iLIR searches for instances of short sequences compliant with a refined sensitive regular expression pattern of the extended LIR motif (xLIR-motif) and retrieves characterized protein domains from the SMART database for the query. Additionally  iLIR scores xLIRs against a custom position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and identifies potentially disordered subsequences with protein interaction potential overlapping with detected xLIR-motifs. Here we demonstrate that proteins satisfying these criteria make good LIRCP candidates for further experimental verification. Domain architecture is displayed in an informative graphic  and detailed results are also available in tabular form. We anticipate that iLIR will assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in eukaryotes. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mitochondrial Rab GAPs govern autophagosome biogenesis during mitophagy.Damaged mitochondria can be selectively eliminated by mitophagy. Although two gene products mutated in Parkinson's disease  PINK1  and Parkin have been found to play a central role in triggering mitophagy in mammals  how the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane selectively and accurately engulfs damaged mitochondria remains unclear. In this study  we demonstrate that TBC1D15  a mitochondrial Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP)  governs autophagosome biogenesis and morphology downstream of Parkin activation. To constrain autophagosome morphogenesis to that of the cargo  TBC1D15 inhibits Rab7 activity and associates with both the mitochondria through binding Fis1 and the isolation membrane through the interactions with LC3/GABARAP family members. Another TBC family member TBC1D17  also participates in mitophagy and forms homodimers and heterodimers with TBC1D15. These results demonstrate that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 mediate proper autophagic encapsulation of mitochondria by regulating Rab7 activity at the interface between mitochondria and isolation membranes.

AUTOPHAGY-RELATED11 plays a critical role in general autophagy- and senescence-induced mitophagy in Arabidopsis.Autophagy-mediated turnover removes damaged organelles and unwanted cytoplasmic constituents and thus plays critical roles in cellular housekeeping and nutrient recycling. This "self eating" is tightly regulated by the AUTOPHAGY-RELATED1/13 (ATG1/13) kinase complex  which connects metabolic and environmental cues to the vacuolar delivery of autophagic vesicles. Here  we describe the Arabidopsis thaliana accessory proteins ATG11 and ATG101  which help link the ATG1/13 complex to autophagic membranes. ATG11 promotes vesicle delivery to the vacuole but is not essential for synthesizing the ATG12-ATG5 and ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine adducts that are central to autophagic vesicle assembly. ATG11  ATG101  ATG1  and ATG13 colocalize with each other and with ATG8  with ATG1 tethered to ATG8 via a canonical ATG8-interacting motif. Also  the presence of ATG11 encourages starvation-induced phosphorylation of ATG1 and turnover of ATG1 and ATG13. Like other atg mutants  ATG11-deficient plants senesce prematurely and are hypersensitive to nitrogen and fixed-carbon limitations. Additionally  we discovered that the senescence-induced breakdown of mitochondria-resident proteins and mitochondrial vesicles occurs via an autophagic process requiring ATG11 and other ATG components. Together  our data indicate that ATG11 (and possibly ATG101) provides important scaffolds connecting the ATG1/13 complex to both general autophagy and selective mitophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Peroxisomal Atg37 binds Atg30 or palmitoyl-CoA to regulate phagophore formation during pexophagy.Autophagy is a membrane trafficking pathway that sequesters proteins and organelles into autophagosomes. The selectivity of this pathway is determined by autophagy receptors  such as the Pichia pastoris autophagy-related protein 30 (Atg30)  which controls the selective autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy) through the assembly of a receptor protein complex (RPC). However  how the pexophagic RPC is regulated for efficient formation of the phagophore  an isolation membrane that sequesters the peroxisome from the cytosol  is unknown. Here we describe a new  conserved acyl-CoA-binding protein  Atg37  that is an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required specifically for pexophagy at the stage of phagophore formation. Atg30 recruits Atg37 to the pexophagic RPC  where Atg37 regulates the recruitment of the scaffold protein  Atg11. Palmitoyl-CoA competes with Atg30 for Atg37 binding. The human orthologue of Atg37  acyl-CoA-binding domain containing protein 5 (ACBD5)  is also peroxisomal and is required specifically for pexophagy. We suggest that Atg37/ACBD5 is a new component and positive regulator of the pexophagic RPC. ,Autophagy_LIR

A LC3-interacting motif in the influenza A virus M2 protein is required to subvert autophagy and maintain virion stability.Autophagy recycles cellular components and defends cells against intracellular pathogens. While viruses must evade autophagocytic destruction  some viruses can also subvert autophagy for their own benefit. The ability of influenza A virus (IAV) to evade autophagy depends on the Matrix 2 (M2) ion-channel protein. We show that the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 interacts directly with the essential autophagy protein LC3 and promotes LC3 relocalization to the unexpected destination of the plasma membrane. LC3 binding is mediated by a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in M2. The M2 LIR is required for LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in virus-infected cells. Mutations in M2 that abolish LC3 binding interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability. IAV therefore subverts autophagy by mimicking a host short linear protein-protein interaction motif. This strategy may facilitate transmission of infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny. ,Autophagy_LIR

Molecular mechanism of autophagic membrane-scaffold assembly and disassembly.Autophagy is a catabolic pathway that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. A key step in the pathway is the covalent conjugation of the ubiquitin-related protein Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (Atg8-PE) in autophagic membranes by a complex consisting of Atg16 and the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Atg8 controls the expansion of autophagic precursor membranes  but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here  we reconstitute Atg8 conjugation on giant unilamellar vesicles and supported lipid bilayers. We found that Atg8-PE associates with Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 into a membrane scaffold. By contrast  scaffold formation is counteracted by the mitochondrial cargo adaptor Atg32 through competition with Atg12-Atg5 for Atg8 binding. Atg4  previously known to recycle Atg8 from membranes  disassembles the scaffold. Importantly  mutants of Atg12 and Atg16 deficient in scaffold formation in vitro impair autophagy in vivo. This suggests that autophagic scaffolds are critical for phagophore biogenesis and thus autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

LC3C Contributes to Vpu-Mediated Antagonism of BST2/Tetherin Restriction on HIV-1 Release through a Non-canonical Autophagy Pathway.BST2 (bone marrow stromal antigen 2)/tetherin is a restriction factor of enveloped viruses  which blocks the release of viral particles. HIV-1 encodes proteins that antagonize this innate barrier  including the accessory protein Vpu. Here  we investigate whether the autophagy pathway and/or ATG proteins are hijacked by HIV-1 Vpu to circumvent BST2 restriction of viral release. We report that BST2 and Vpu are present in LC3-positive compartments. We found that Vpu selectively interacts with the ATG8 ortholog LC3C through the Vpu L<sub>63</sub>VEM<sub>66</sub> sequence. This sequence is required for Vpu to antagonize BST2 restriction. LC3C expression favors the removal of BST2 from the HIV-1 budding site  and thus HIV-1 release in BST2-expressing cells. Additionally  ATG5 and beclin 1/ATG6  but not all the components of the autophagy pathway  act with LC3C to facilitate Vpu antagonism of BST2 restriction. Altogether  our data support the view that a non-canonical autophagy pathway reminiscent of LC3-associated phagocytosis contributes to Vpu counteraction of BST2 restriction. ,Autophagy_LIR

PEBP1  a RAF kinase inhibitory protein  negatively regulates starvation-induced autophagy by direct interaction with LC3.Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining cell homeostasis in response to various stressors through protein conjugation and activation of lysosome-dependent degradation. MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule- associated protein 1 light chain 3 β) is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the membranes and regulates initiation of autophagy through interaction with many autophagy-related proteins possessing an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif  which is composed of 2 hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan and leucine) separated by 2 non-conserved amino acids (WXXL). In this study  we identified a new putative LIR motif in PEBP1/RKIP (phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) that was originally isolated as a PE-binding protein and also a cellular inhibitor of MAPK/ERK signaling. PEBP1 was specifically bound to PE-unconjugated LC3 in cells  and mutation (WXXL mutated to AXXA) of this LIR motif disrupted its interaction with LC3 proteins. Interestingly  overexpression of PEBP1 significantly inhibited starvation-induced autophagy by activating the AKT and MTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] complex 1) signaling pathway and consequently suppressing the ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) activity. In contrast  ablation of PEBP1 expression dramatically promoted the autophagic process under starvation conditions. Furthermore  PEBP1 lacking the LIR motif highly stimulated starvation-induced autophagy through the AKT-MTORC1-dependent pathway. PEBP1 phosphorylation at Ser153 caused dissociation of LC3 from the PEBP1-LC3 complex for autophagy induction. PEBP1-dependent suppression of autophagy was not associated with the MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that PEBP1 can act as a negative mediator in autophagy through stimulation of the AKT-MTORC1 pathway and direct interaction with LC3. ,Autophagy_LIR

The 1:2 complex between RavZ and LC3 reveals a mechanism for deconjugation of LC3 on the phagophore membrane.Hosts utilize macroautophagy/autophagy to clear invading bacteria; however  bacteria have also developed a specific mechanism to survive by manipulating the host cell autophagy mechanism. One pathogen  Legionella pneumophila  can hinder host cell autophagy by using the specific effector protein RavZ that cleaves phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3 on the phagophore membrane. However  the detailed molecular mechanisms associated with the function of RavZ have hitherto remained unclear. Here  we report on the biochemical characteristics of the RavZ-LC3 interaction  the solution structure of the 1:2 complex between RavZ and LC3  and crystal structures of RavZ showing different conformations of the active site loop without LC3. Based on our biochemical  structural  and cell-based analyses of RavZ and LC3  both distant flexible N- and C-terminal regions containing LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are important for substrate recognition. These results suggest a novel mechanism of RavZ action on the phagophore membrane and lay the groundwork for understanding how bacterial pathogens can survive autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Translocon component Sec62 acts in endoplasmic reticulum turnover during stress recovery.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a site of protein biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Perturbing ER homeostasis activates stress programs collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR enhances production of ER-resident chaperones and enzymes to reduce the burden of misfolded proteins. On resolution of ER stress  ill-defined  selective autophagic programs remove excess ER components. Here we identify Sec62  a constituent of the translocon complex regulating protein import in the mammalian ER  as an ER-resident autophagy receptor. Sec62 intervenes during recovery from ER stress to selectively deliver ER components to the autolysosomal system for clearance in a series of events that we name recovER-phagy. Sec62 contains a conserved LC3-interacting region in the C-terminal cytosolic domain that is required for its function in recovER-phagy  but is dispensable for its function in the protein translocation machinery. Our results identify Sec62 as a critical molecular component in maintenance and recovery of ER homeostasis. ,Autophagy_LIR

VCP recruitment to mitochondria causes mitophagy impairment and neurodegeneration in models of Huntington's disease.Mutant Huntingtin (mtHtt) causes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) by evoking defects in the mitochondria  but the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Our proteomic analysis identifies valosin-containing protein (VCP) as an mtHtt-binding protein on the mitochondria. Here we show that VCP is selectively translocated to the mitochondria  where it is bound to mtHtt in various HD models. Mitochondria-accumulated VCP elicits excessive mitophagy  causing neuronal cell death. Blocking mtHtt/VCP mitochondrial interaction with a peptide  HV-3  abolishes VCP translocation to the mitochondria  corrects excessive mitophagy and reduces cell death in HD mouse- and patient-derived cells and HD transgenic mouse brains. Treatment with HV-3 reduces behavioural and neuropathological phenotypes of HD in both fragment- and full-length mtHtt transgenic mice. Our findings demonstrate a causal role of mtHtt-induced VCP mitochondrial accumulation in HD pathogenesis and suggest that the peptide HV-3 might be a useful tool for developing new therapeutics to treat HD. ,Autophagy_LIR

MAVS maintains mitochondrial homeostasis via autophagy.Mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) acts as a critical adaptor protein to transduce antiviral signalling by physically interacting with activated RIG-I and MDA5 receptors. MAVS executes its functions at the outer membrane of mitochondria to regulate downstream antiviral signalling  indicating that the mitochondria provides a functional platform for innate antiviral signalling transduction. However  little is known about whether and how MAVS-mediated antiviral signalling contributes to mitochondrial homeostasis. Here we show that the activation of MAVS is sufficient to induce autophagic signalling  which may mediate the turnover of the damaged mitochondria. Importantly  we find MAVS directly interacts with LC3 through its LC3-binding motif 'YxxI'  suggesting that MAVS might act as an autophagy receptor to mediate mitochondrial turnover upon excessive activation of RLR signalling. Furthermore  we provide evidence that both MAVS self-aggregation and its interaction with TRAF2/6 proteins are important for MAVS-mediated mitochondrial turnover. Collectively  our findings suggest that MAVS acts as a potential receptor for mitochondria-associated autophagic signalling to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural Basis of Host Autophagy-related Protein 8 (ATG8) Binding by the Irish Potato Famine Pathogen Effector Protein PexRD54.Filamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins to host cells to promote infection. The Phytophthora infestans RXLR-type effector PexRD54 binds potato ATG8 via its ATG8 family-interacting motif (AIM) and perturbs host-selective autophagy. However  the structural basis of this interaction remains unknown. Here  we define the crystal structure of PexRD54  which includes a modular architecture  including five tandem repeat domains  with the AIM sequence presented at the disordered C terminus. To determine the interface between PexRD54 and ATG8  we solved the crystal structure of potato ATG8CL in complex with a peptide comprising the effector's AIM sequence  and we established a model of the full-length PexRD54-ATG8CL complex using small angle x-ray scattering. Structure-informed deletion of the PexRD54 tandem domains reveals retention of ATG8CL binding in vitro and in planta This study offers new insights into structure/function relationships of oomycete RXLR effectors and how these proteins engage with host cell targets to promote disease. ,Autophagy_LIR

Novel insights into how autophagy regulates tumor cell motility.Metastasis requires tumor cells to overcome a series of challenges to successfully travel to and colonize new microenvironments. As an adaptive (or maladaptive) response to stress  macroautophagy/autophagy has garnered increasing interest with respect to cancer metastasis  supported by clinical observations of increased autophagic flux in distant metastases relative to primary tumors. Recently  we identified a new role for autophagy in tumor cell motility through the turnover of focal adhesions  large multi-protein structures that link extracellular matrix-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton. The disassembly of focal adhesions at the cell rear is critical to forward movement and successful migration/invasion. We demonstrated that the focal adhesion protein PXN (paxillin)  which serves as a crucial scaffolding and signal integrator  binds directly to LC3B through a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly and metastasis and that this interaction is further promoted by oncogenic SRC. ,Autophagy_LIR

Accessory Interaction Motifs in the Atg19 Cargo Receptor Enable Strong Binding to the Clustered Ubiquitin-related Atg8 Protein.Selective autophagy contributes to cellular homeostasis by delivering harmful material into the lysosomal system for degradation via vesicular intermediates referred to as autophagosomes. The cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway is a variant of selective autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during which hydrolases such as prApe1 are transported into the vacuole. In general  selectivity is achieved by autophagic cargo receptors that link the cargo to autophagosomal membranes because of their ability to simultaneously interact with the cargo and Atg8 proteins that coat the membrane. The Atg19 receptor contains multiple Atg8 interaction sites in its C terminus in addition to a canonical Atg8-interacting LC3-interacting region (LIR  with LC3 being a homolog of Atg8) motif  but their mode of interaction with Atg8 is unclear. Here we show  using a combination of NMR  microscopy-based interaction assays  and prApe1 processing experiments  that two additional sites interact with Atg8 in a LIR-like and thus mutually exclusive manner. We term these motifs accessory LIR motifs because their affinities are lower than that of the canonical LIR motif. Thus  one Atg19 molecule has the ability to interact with multiple Atg8 proteins simultaneously  resulting in a high-avidity interaction that may confer specific binding to the Atg8-coated autophagosomal membrane on which Atg8 is concentrated. ,Autophagy_LIR

Cadherin-6 promotes EMT and cancer metastasis by restraining autophagy.The transdifferentiation of epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal condition (EMT) is a complex process that allows tumor cells to migrate to ectopic sites. Cadherins are not just structural proteins  but they act as sensors of the surrounding microenvironment and as signaling centers for cellular pathways. However  the molecular mechanisms underlying these signaling functions remain poorly characterized. Cadherin-6 (CDH6) is a type 2 cadherin  which drives EMT during embryonic development and it is aberrantly re-activated in cancer. We recently showed that CDH6 is a TGFβ target and an EMT marker in thyroid cancer  suggesting a role for this protein in the progression of this type of tumor. Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) are usually indolent lesions. However  metastatic spreading occurs in about 5% of the cases. The identification of molecular markers that could early predict the metastatic potential of these lesions would be strategic to design more tailored approaches and reduce patients overtreatment. In this work  we assessed the role of CDH6 in the metastatic progression of thyroid cancer. We showed that loss of CDH6 expression profoundly changes cellular architecture  alters the inter-cellular interaction modalities and attenuates EMT features in thyroid cancer cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach  based on a thyroid cancer patients library  we showed that CDH6 directly interacts with GABARAP  BNIP3 and BNIP3L  and that through these interactions CDH6 restrains autophagy and promotes re-organization of mitochondrial network through a DRP1-mediated mechanism. Analysis of the LIR domains suggests that the interaction with the autophagic machinery may be a common feature of many cadherin family members. Finally  the analysis of CDH6 expression in a unique cohort of human PTCs showed that CDH6 expression marks specifically EMT cells. and it is strongly associated with metastatic behavior and worse outcome of PTCs. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural basis of FYCO1 and MAP1LC3A interaction reveals a novel binding mode for Atg8-family proteins.FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing 1) functions as an autophagy adaptor in directly linking autophagosomes with the microtubule-based kinesin motor  and plays an essential role in the microtubule plus end-directed transport of autophagic vesicles. The specific association of FYCO1 with autophagosomes is mediated by its interaction with Atg8-family proteins decorated on the outer surface of autophagosome. However  the mechanistic basis governing the interaction between FYCO1 and Atg8-family proteins is largely unknown. Here  using biochemical and structural analyses  we demonstrated that FYCO1 contains a unique LC3-interacting region (LIR)  which discriminately binds to mammalian Atg8 orthologs and preferentially binds to the MAP1LC3A and MAP1LC3B. In addition to uncovering the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the FYCO1 LIR and MAP1LC3A interaction  the determined FYCO1-LIR-MAP1LC3A complex structure also reveals a unique LIR binding mode for Atg8-family proteins  and demonstrates  first  the functional relevance of adjacent sequences C-terminal to the LIR core motif for binding to Atg8-family proteins. Taken together  our findings not only provide new mechanistic insight into FYCO1-mediated transport of autophagosomes  but also expand our understanding of the interaction modes between LIR motifs and Atg8-family proteins in general. ,Autophagy_LIR

Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) Promotes Dishevelled Protein Degradation via Autophagy and Antagonizes Wnt Signaling.Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development  tissue homeostasis  and cancer development. Dishevelled (Dvl) is an essential and central component in Wnt signaling  and its stability and activity is tightly regulated. It has been shown that Dvl can be degraded via both the proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. Here we report that receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) negatively regulates Dishevelled stability and Wnt signaling. RACK1 interacts with Dvl proteins and promotes their lysosomal degradation  and this effect is enhanced by autophagy induction. RACK1 also interacts with LC3 and enhances the association of LC3 with Dvl2  thereby leading to degradation of Dvl proteins through autophagy. These findings reveal a novel regulatory function of RACK1 in Wnt signaling by modulating Dvl stability. ,Autophagy_LIR

hfAIM: A reliable bioinformatics approach for in silico genome-wide identification of autophagy-associated Atg8-interacting motifs in various organisms.Most of the proteins that are specifically turned over by selective autophagy are recognized by the presence of short Atg8 interacting motifs (AIMs) that facilitate their association with the autophagy apparatus. Such AIMs can be identified by bioinformatics methods based on their defined degenerate consensus F/W/Y-X-X-L/I/V sequences in which X represents any amino acid. Achieving reliability and/or fidelity of the prediction of such AIMs on a genome-wide scale represents a major challenge. Here  we present a bioinformatics approach  high fidelity AIM (hfAIM)  which uses additional sequence requirements-the presence of acidic amino acids and the absence of positively charged amino acids in certain positions-to reliably identify AIMs in proteins. We demonstrate that the use of the hfAIM method allows for in silico high fidelity prediction of AIMs in AIM-containing proteins (ACPs) on a genome-wide scale in various organisms. Furthermore  by using hfAIM to identify putative AIMs in the Arabidopsis proteome  we illustrate a potential contribution of selective autophagy to various biological processes. More specifically  we identified 9 peroxisomal PEX proteins that contain hfAIM motifs  among which AtPEX1  AtPEX6 and AtPEX10 possess evolutionary-conserved AIMs. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) results verified that AtPEX6 and AtPEX10 indeed interact with Atg8 in planta. In addition  we show that mutations occurring within or nearby hfAIMs in PEX1  PEX6 and PEX10 caused defects in the growth and development of various organisms. Taken together  the above results suggest that the hfAIM tool can be used to effectively perform genome-wide in silico screens of proteins that are potentially regulated by selective autophagy. The hfAIM system is a web tool that can be accessed at link: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/hfAIM/. ,Autophagy_LIR

Tumor suppressor Spred2 interaction with LC3 promotes autophagosome maturation and induces autophagy-dependent cell death.The tumor suppressor Spred2 (Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-2) induces cell death in a variety of cancers. However  the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we show that Spred2 induces caspase-independent but autophagy-dependent cell death in human cervical carcinoma HeLa and lung cancer A549 cells. We demonstrate that ectopic Spred2 increased both the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)  GFP-LC3 puncta formation and p62/SQSTM1 degradation in A549 and HeLa cells. Conversely  knockdown of Spred2 in tumor cells inhibited upregulation of autophagosome maturation induced by the autophagy inducer Rapamycin  which could be reversed by the rescue Spred2. These data suggest that Spred2 promotes autophagy in tumor cells. Mechanistically  Spred2 co-localized and interacted with LC3 via the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs in its SPR domain. Mutations in the LIR motifs or deletion of the SPR domain impaired Spred2-mediated autophagosome maturation and tumor cell death  indicating that functional LIR is required for Spred2 to trigger tumor cell death. Additionally  Spred2 interacted and co-localized with p62/SQSTM1 through its SPR domain. Furthermore  the co-localization of Spred2  p62 and LAMP2 in HeLa cells indicates that p62 may be involved in Spred2-mediated autophagosome maturation. Inhibition of autophagy using the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine  reduced Spred2-mediated HeLa cell death. Silencing the expression of autophagy-related genes ATG5  LC3 or p62 in HeLa and A549 cells gave similar results  suggesting that autophagy is required for Spred2-induced tumor cell death. Collectively  these data indicate that Spred2 induces tumor cell death in an autophagy-dependent manner. ,Autophagy_LIR

NBR1 enables autophagy-dependent focal adhesion turnover.Autophagy is a catabolic pathway involving the sequestration of cellular contents into a double-membrane vesicle  the autophagosome. Although recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy supports cell migration  the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using live-cell imaging  we uncover that autophagy promotes optimal migratory rate and facilitates the dynamic assembly and disassembly of cell-matrix focal adhesions (FAs)  which is essential for efficient motility. Additionally  our studies reveal that autophagosomes associate with FAs primarily during disassembly  suggesting autophagy locally facilitates the destabilization of cell-matrix contact sites. Furthermore  we identify the selective autophagy cargo receptor neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) as a key mediator of autophagy-dependent FA remodeling. NBR1 depletion impairs FA turnover and decreases targeting of autophagosomes to FAs  whereas ectopic expression of autophagy-competent  but not autophagy-defective  NBR1 enhances FA disassembly and reduces FA lifetime during migration. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how autophagy promotes migration by revealing a requirement for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy in enabling FA disassembly in motile cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

An effector of the Irish potato famine pathogen antagonizes a host autophagy cargo receptor.Plants use autophagy to safeguard against infectious diseases. However  how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. Here  we show that PexRD54  an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans  binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus  a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses. ,Autophagy_LIR

CCPG1 Is a Non-canonical Autophagy Cargo Receptor Essential for ER-Phagy and Pancreatic ER Proteostasis.Mechanisms of selective autophagy of the ER  known as ER-phagy  require molecular delineation  particularly in vivo. It is unclear how these events control ER proteostasis and cellular health. Here  we identify cell-cycle progression gene 1 (CCPG1)  an ER-resident protein with no known physiological role  as a non-canonical cargo receptor that directly binds to core autophagy proteins via an LIR motif to mammalian ATG8 proteins and  independently and via a discrete motif  to FIP200. These interactions facilitate ER-phagy. The CCPG1 gene is inducible by the unfolded protein response and thus directly links ER stress to ER-phagy. In vivo  CCPG1 protects against ER luminal protein aggregation and consequent unfolded protein response hyperactivation and tissue injury of the exocrine pancreas. Thus  via identification of this autophagy protein  we describe an unexpected molecular mechanism of ER-phagy and provide evidence that this may be physiologically relevant in ER luminal proteostasis. ,Autophagy_LIR

Induction of autophagy and autophagy-dependent apoptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by a new antimalarial artemisinin derivative  SM1044.Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. R-CHOP is currently the standard therapy for DLBCL  but the prognosis of refractory or recurrent patients remains poor. In this study  we synthesized a new water-soluble antimalarial drug artemisinin derivative  SM1044. The treatment of DLBCL cell lines with SM1044 induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis  which is directed by an accelerated degradation of the antiapoptosis protein Survivin  via its acetylation-dependent interaction with the autophagy-related protein LC3-II. Additionally  SM1044 also stimulates the de novo synthesis of ceramide  which in turn activates the CaMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 axis  leading to the initiation of autophagy. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanism of autophagy-dependent apoptosis in DLBCL cells  but also suggest that SM1044 is a promising therapeutic molecule for the treatment of DLBCL  along with R-CHOP regimen. ,Autophagy_LIR

The autophagy receptor ALLO-1 and the IKKE-1 kinase control clearance of paternal mitochondria in Caenorhabditis elegans.In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos  paternally provided organelles  including mitochondria  are eliminated by a process of selective autophagy called allophagy  the mechanism by which mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally. However  it remains unclear how paternal organelles are recognized and targeted for autophagy. Here  we identified an autophagy receptor for allophagy  ALLO-1. ALLO-1 is essential for autophagosome formation around paternal organelles and directly binds to the worm LC3 homologue LGG-1 through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. After fertilization  ALLO-1 accumulates on the paternal organelles before autophagosome formation  and this localization depends on the ubiquitin modification of the paternal organelles. We also identified IKKE-1  a worm homologue of the TBK1 and IKKε family kinase  as another critical regulator of allophagy. IKKE-1 interacts with ALLO-1  and the IKKE-1-dependent phosphorylation of ALLO-1 is important for paternal organelle clearance. Thus  we propose that ALLO-1 is the allophagy receptor whose function is regulated by IKKE-1-dependent phosphorylation. ,Autophagy_LIR

The E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 enhances killing of membrane-perturbing intracellular bacteria by promoting autophagy.The E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 has been intensively studied in processes involved in viral infections  such as virus budding. However  little is known about its functions in bacterial infections. Our investigations into the role of NEDD4 in intracellular bacterial infections demonstrate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes  but not Mycobacterium bovis BCG  replicate more efficiently in NEDD4 knockdown macrophages. In parallel  NEDD4 knockdown or knockout impaired basal macroautophagy/autophagy  as well as infection-induced autophagy. Conversely  NEDD4 expression promoted autophagy in an E3 catalytic activity-dependent manner  thereby restricting intracellular Listeria replication. Mechanistic studies uncovered that endogenous NEDD4 interacted with BECN1/Beclin 1 and this interaction increased during Listeria infection. Deficiency of NEDD4 resulted in elevated K48-linkage ubiquitination of endogenous BECN1. Further  NEDD4 mediated K6- and K27- linkage ubiquitination of BECN1  leading to elevated stability of BECN1 and increased autophagy. Thus  NEDD4 participates in killing of intracellular bacterial pathogens via autophagy by sustaining the stability of BECN1. ,Autophagy_LIR

Plasmodium UIS3 sequesters host LC3 to avoid elimination by autophagy in hepatocytes.The causative agent of malaria  Plasmodium  replicates inside a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV)  which shields this intracellular parasite from the cytosol of the host cell <sup>1</sup> . One common threat for intracellular pathogens is the homeostatic process of autophagy  through which cells capture unwanted intracellular material for lysosomal degradation <sup>2</sup> . During the liver stage of a malaria infection  Plasmodium parasites are targeted by the autophagy machinery of the host cell  and the PV membrane (PVM) becomes decorated with several autophagy markers  including LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) <sup>3 4</sup> . Here we show that Plasmodium berghei parasites infecting hepatic cells rely on the PVM transmembrane protein UIS3 to avoid elimination by host-cell-mediated autophagy. We found that UIS3 binds host LC3 through a non-canonical interaction with a specialized surface on LC3 where host proteins with essential functions during autophagy also bind. UIS3 acts as a bona fide autophagy inhibitor by competing with host LC3-interacting proteins for LC3 binding. Our work identifies UIS3  one of the most promising candidates for a genetically attenuated vaccine against malaria <sup>5</sup>   as a unique and potent mediator of autophagy evasion in Plasmodium. We propose that the protein-protein interaction between UIS3 and host LC3 represents a target for antimalarial drug development. ,Autophagy_LIR

Kenny mediates selective autophagic degradation of the IKK complex to control innate immune responses.Selective autophagy is a catabolic process with which cellular material is specifically targeted for degradation by lysosomes. The function of selective autophagic degradation of self-components in the regulation of innate immunity is still unclear. Here we show that Drosophila Kenny  the homolog of mammalian IKKγ  is a selective autophagy receptor that mediates the degradation of the IκB kinase complex. Selective autophagic degradation of the IκB kinase complex prevents constitutive activation of the immune deficiency pathway in response to commensal microbiota. We show that autophagy-deficient flies have a systemic innate immune response that promotes a hyperplasia phenotype in the midgut. Remarkably  human IKKγ does not interact with mammalian Atg8-family proteins. Using a mathematical model  we suggest mechanisms by which pathogen selection might have driven the loss of LIR motif functionality during evolution. Our results suggest that there may have been an autophagy-related switch during the evolution of the IKKγ proteins in metazoans. ,Autophagy_LIR

iLIR@viral: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in viruses.Macroautophagy/autophagy has been shown to mediate the selective lysosomal degradation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses (xenophagy)  and to contribute to the activation of innate and adaptative immune responses. Autophagy can serve as an antiviral defense mechanism but also as a proviral process during infection. Atg8-family proteins play a central role in the autophagy process due to their ability to interact with components of the autophagy machinery as well as selective autophagy receptors and adaptor proteins. Such interactions are usually mediated through LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. So far  only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional LIR motif  leaving open a vast field for investigation. Here  we have developed the iLIR@viral database ( http://ilir.uk/virus/ ) as a freely accessible web resource listing all the putative canonical LIR motifs identified in viral proteins. Additionally  we used a curated text-mining analysis of the literature to identify novel putative LIR motif-containing proteins (LIRCPs) in viruses. We anticipate that iLIR@viral will assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in viruses. ,Autophagy_LIR

Centriolar Satellites Control GABARAP Ubiquitination and GABARAP-Mediated Autophagy.Autophagy maintains cellular health and homeostasis during stress by delivering cytosolic material captured by autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagosome formation is complex: initiated by the recruitment of autophagy (Atg) proteins to the formation site  it is sustained by activation of Atg proteins to allow growth and closure of the autophagosome. How Atg proteins are translocated to the forming autophagosome is not fully understood. Transport of the ATG8 family member GABARAP from the centrosome occurs during starvation-induced autophagosome biogenesis  but how centrosomal proteins regulate GABARAP localization is unknown. We show that the centriolar satellite protein PCM1 regulates the recruitment of GABARAP to the pericentriolar material. In addition to residing on the pericentriolar material  GABARAP marks a subtype of PCM1-positive centriolar satellites. GABARAP  but not another ATG8 family member LC3B  binds directly to PCM1 through a canonical LIR motif. Loss of PCM1 results in destabilization of GABARAP  but not LC3B  through proteasomal degradation. GABARAP instability is mediated through the centriolar satellite E3 ligase Mib1  which interacts with GABARAP through its substrate-binding region and promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of GABARAP. Ubiquitination of GABARAP occurs in the N terminus  a domain associated with ATG8-family-specific functions during autophagosome formation  on residues absent in the LC3 family. Furthermore  PCM1-GABARAP-positive centriolar satellites colocalize with forming autophagosomes. PCM1 enhances GABARAP/WIPI2/p62-positive autophagosome formation and flux but has no significant effect on LC3B-positive autophagosome formation. These data suggest a mechanism for how centriolar satellites can specifically regulate an ATG8 ortholog  the centrosomal GABARAP reservoir  and centrosome-autophagosome crosstalk. ,Autophagy_LIR

Structural and functional analysis of the GABARAP interaction motif (GIM).Through the canonical LC3 interaction motif (LIR)  [W/F/Y]-X<sub>1</sub>-X<sub>2</sub>-[I/L/V]  protein complexes are recruited to autophagosomes to perform their functions as either autophagy adaptors or receptors. How these adaptors/receptors selectively interact with either LC3 or GABARAP families remains unclear. Herein  we determine the range of selectivity of 30 known core LIR motifs towards individual LC3s and GABARAPs. From these  we define a <u><b>G</b></u> ABARAP <u><b>I</b></u> nteraction <u><b>M</b></u> otif (GIM) sequence ([W/F]-[V/I]-X<sub>2</sub>-V) that the adaptor protein PLEKHM1 tightly conforms to. Using biophysical and structural approaches  we show that the PLEKHM1-LIR is indeed 11-fold more specific for GABARAP than LC3B. Selective mutation of the X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> positions either completely abolished the interaction with all LC3 and GABARAPs or increased PLEKHM1-GIM selectivity 20-fold towards LC3B. Finally  we show that conversion of p62/SQSTM1  FUNDC1 and FIP200 LIRs into our newly defined GIM  by introducing two valine residues  enhances their interaction with endogenous GABARAP over LC3B. The identification of a GABARAP-specific interaction motif will aid the identification and characterization of the expanding array of autophagy receptor and adaptor proteins and their <i>in vivo</i> functions. ,Autophagy_LIR

Full length RTN3 regulates turnover of tubular endoplasmic reticulum via selective autophagy.The turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ensures the correct biological activity of its distinct domains. In mammalian cells  the ER is degraded via a selective autophagy pathway (ER-phagy)  mediated by two specific receptors: FAM134B  responsible for the turnover of ER sheets and SEC62 that regulates ER recovery following stress. Here  we identified reticulon 3 (RTN3) as a specific receptor for the degradation of ER tubules. Oligomerization of the long isoform of RTN3 is sufficient to trigger fragmentation of ER tubules. The long N-terminal region of RTN3 contains several newly identified LC3-interacting regions (LIR). Binding to LC3s/GABARAPs is essential for the fragmentation of ER tubules and their delivery to lysosomes. RTN3-mediated ER-phagy requires conventional autophagy components  but is independent of FAM134B. None of the other reticulon family members have the ability to induce fragmentation of ER tubules during starvation. Therefore  we assign a unique function to RTN3 during autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

Lift and cut: Anti-host autophagy mechanism of Legionella pneumophila.RavZ  an effector protein of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila  inhibits host macroautophagy/autophagy by deconjugation of lipidated LC3 proteins from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the autophagosome membrane. The mechanism for how RavZ specifically recognizes and deconjugates the lipidated LC3s is not clear. To understand the structure-function relationship of LC3-deconjugation by RavZ  we prepared semisynthetic LC3 proteins modified with different fragments of PE or 1-hexadecanol (C16). We find that RavZ activity is strictly dependent on the conjugated PE structure and RavZ extracts LC3-PE from the membrane before deconjugation. Structural and biophysical analysis of RavZ-LC3 interactions suggest that RavZ initially recognizes LC3-PE on the membrane via its N-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. RavZ specifically targets to autophagosome membranes by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) via its C-terminal domain and association with membranes via the hydrophobic α3 helix. The α3 helix is involved in extraction of the PE moiety and docking of the fatty acid chains into the lipid-binding site of RavZ  which is related in structure to that of the phospholipid transfer protein Sec14. The LIR interaction and lipid binding facilitate subsequent proteolytic cleavage of LC3-PE. The findings reveal a novel mode of host-pathogen interaction. ,Autophagy_LIR

Insights into links between autophagy and the ubiquitin system from the structure of LC3B bound to the LIR motif from the E3 ligase NEDD4.Members of the LC3/GABARAP family of ubiquitin-like proteins function during autophagy by serving as membrane linked protein-binding platforms. Their C-termini are physically attached to membranes through covalent linkage to primary amines on lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine  while their ubiquitin-like fold domains bind "LIR" (LC3-Interacting Region) sequences found within an extraordinarily diverse array of proteins including regulators of autophagy  adaptors that recruit ubiquitinated cargoes to be degraded  and even proteins controlling processes at membranes that are not associated with autophagy. Recently  LC3/GABARAP proteins were found to bind the ubiquitin E3 ligase NEDD4 to influence ubiquitination associated with autophagy in human cell lines. Here  we use purified recombinant proteins to define LC3B interactions with a specific LIR sequence from NEDD4  present a crystal structure showing atomic details of the interaction  and show that LC3B-binding can steer intrinsic NEDD4 E3 ligase activity. The data provide detailed molecular insights underlying recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to phagophores during autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

The BEACH-containing protein WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to promote aggrephagy.Autophagy-dependent clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins is critical to protein quality control  but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here  we report the essential role of the BEACH (beige and Chediak-Higashi) and WD40 repeat-containing protein WDR81 in eliminating ubiquitinated proteins through autophagy. WDR81 associates with ubiquitin (Ub)-positive protein foci  and its loss causes accumulation of Ub proteins and the autophagy cargo receptor p62. WDR81 interacts with p62  facilitating recognition of Ub proteins by p62. Furthermore  WDR81 interacts with LC3C through canonical LC3-interacting regions in the BEACH domain  promoting LC3C recruitment to ubiquitinated proteins. Inactivation of LC3C or defective autophagy results in accumulation of Ub protein aggregates enriched for WDR81. In mice  WDR81 inactivation causes accumulation of p62 bodies in cortical and striatal neurons in the brain. These data suggest that WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to facilitate autophagic removal of Ub proteins  and provide important insights into CAMRQ2 syndrome  a WDR81-related developmental disorder. ,Autophagy_LIR

Selective Autophagy of BES1 Mediated by DSK2 Balances Plant Growth and Survival.Plants encounter a variety of stresses and must fine-tune their growth and stress-response programs to best suit their environment. BES1 functions as a master regulator in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway that promotes plant growth. Here  we show that BES1 interacts with the ubiquitin receptor protein DSK2 and is targeted to the autophagy pathway during stress via the interaction of DSK2 with ATG8  a ubiquitin-like protein directing autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment. Additionally  DSK2 is phosphorylated by the GSK3-like kinase BIN2  a negative regulator in the BR pathway. BIN2 phosphorylation of DSK2 flanking its ATG8 interacting motifs (AIMs) promotes DSK2-ATG8 interaction  thereby targeting BES1 for degradation. Accordingly  loss-of-function dsk2 mutants accumulate BES1  have altered global gene expression profiles  and have compromised stress responses. Our results thus reveal that plants coordinate growth and stress responses by integrating BR and autophagy pathways and identify the molecular basis of this crosstalk. ,Autophagy_LIR

Elucidation of the anti-autophagy mechanism of the <i>Legionella</i> effector RavZ using semisynthetic LC3 proteins.Autophagy is a conserved cellular process involved in the elimination of proteins and organelles. It is also used to combat infection with pathogenic microbes. The intracellular pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> manipulates autophagy by delivering the effector protein RavZ to deconjugate Atg8/LC3 proteins coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on autophagosomal membranes. To understand how RavZ recognizes and deconjugates LC3-PE  we prepared semisynthetic LC3 proteins and elucidated the structures of the RavZ:LC3 interaction. Semisynthetic LC3 proteins allowed the analysis of structure-function relationships. RavZ extracts LC3-PE from the membrane before deconjugation. RavZ initially recognizes the LC3 molecule on membranes via its N-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. The RavZ α3 helix is involved in extraction of the PE moiety and docking of the acyl chains into the lipid-binding site of RavZ that is related in structure to that of the phospholipid transfer protein Sec14. Thus  <i>Legionella</i> has evolved a novel mechanism to specifically evade host autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

FKBP8 recruits LC3A to mediate Parkin-independent mitophagy.Mitophagy  the selective removal of damaged or excess mitochondria by autophagy  is an important process in cellular homeostasis. The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins NIX  BNIP3  FUNDC1  and Bcl2-L13 recruit ATG8 proteins (LC3/GABARAP) to mitochondria during mitophagy. FKBP8 (also known as FKBP38)  a unique member of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family  is similarly anchored in the OMM and acts as a multifunctional adaptor with anti-apoptotic activity. In a yeast two-hybrid screen  we identified FKBP8 as an ATG8-interacting protein. Here  we map an N-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif in FKBP8 that binds strongly to LC3A both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> FKBP8 efficiently recruits lipidated LC3A to damaged mitochondria in a LIR-dependent manner. The mitophagy receptors BNIP3 and NIX in contrast are unable to mediate an efficient recruitment of LC3A even after mitochondrial damage. Co-expression of FKBP8 with LC3A profoundly induces Parkin-independent mitophagy. Strikingly  even when acting as a mitophagy receptor  FKBP8 avoids degradation by escaping from mitochondria. In summary  this study identifies novel roles for FKBP8 and LC3A  which act together to induce mitophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

The crystal structure of mouse LC3B in complex with the FYCO1 LIR reveals the importance of the flanking region of the LIR motif.FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (FYCO1)  a multidomain autophagy adaptor protein  mediates microtubule plus-end-directed autophagosome transport by interacting with kinesin motor proteins and with the autophagosomal membrane components microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)  Rab7 and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). To establish the structural basis for the recognition of FYCO1 by LC3  the crystal structure of mouse LC3B in complex with the FYCO1 LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif peptide was determined. Structural analysis showed that the flanking sequences N-terminal and C-terminal to the LIR core sequence of FYCO1  as well as the tetrapeptide core sequence  were specifically recognized by LC3B and contributed to the binding. Moreover  comparisons of related structures revealed a conserved mechanism of FYCO1 recognition by different LC3 isoforms among different species. ,Autophagy_LIR

ATG4B contains a C-terminal LIR motif important for binding and efficient cleavage of mammalian orthologs of yeast Atg8.The cysteine protease ATG4B cleaves off one or more C-terminal residues of the inactive proform of proteins of the ortholog and paralog LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies of yeast Atg8 to expose a C-terminal glycine that is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine during autophagosome formation. We show that ATG4B contains a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif important for efficient binding to and cleavage of LC3 and GABARAP proteins. We solved the crystal structures of the GABARAPL1-ATG4B C-terminal LIR complex. Analyses of the structures and in vitro binding assays  using specific point mutants  clearly showed that the ATG4B LIR binds via electrostatic-  aromatic HP1 and hydrophobic HP2 pocket interactions. Both these interactions and the catalytic site-substrate interaction contribute to binding between LC3s or GABARAPs and ATG4B. We also reveal an unexpected role for ATG4B in stabilizing the unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1. In mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) atg4b knockout cells  GABARAP and GABARAPL1 were unstable and degraded by the proteasome. Strikingly  the LIR motif of ATG4B was required for stabilization of the unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1 in cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy functions as an antiviral mechanism against geminiviruses in plants.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that recycles damaged or unwanted cellular components  and has been linked to plant immunity. However  how autophagy contributes to plant immunity is unknown. Here we reported that the plant autophagic machinery targets the virulence factor βC1 of <i>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</i> (CLCuMuV) for degradation through its interaction with the key autophagy protein ATG8. A V32A mutation in βC1 abolished its interaction with NbATG8f  and virus carrying βC1<sup>V32A</sup> showed increased symptoms and viral DNA accumulation in plants. Furthermore  silencing of autophagy-related genes <i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG7</i> reduced plant resistance to the DNA viruses CLCuMuV  <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i>  and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i>  whereas activating autophagy by silencing <i>GAPC</i> genes enhanced plant resistance to viral infection. Thus  autophagy represents a novel anti-pathogenic mechanism that plays an important role in antiviral immunity in plants. ,Autophagy_LIR

A STRIPAK complex mediates axonal transport of autophagosomes and dense core vesicles through PP2A regulation.Autophagy plays an essential role in the cellular homeostasis of neurons  facilitating the clearance of cellular debris. This clearance process is orchestrated through the assembly  transport  and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes for degradation. The motor protein dynein drives autophagosome motility from distal sites of assembly to sites of lysosomal fusion. In this study  we identify the scaffold protein CKA (connector of kinase to AP-1) as essential for autophagosome transport in neurons. Together with other core components of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex  we show that CKA associates with dynein and directly binds Atg8a  an autophagosomal protein. CKA is a regulatory subunit of PP2A  a component of the STRIPAK complex. We propose that the STRIPAK complex modulates dynein activity. Consistent with this hypothesis  we provide evidence that CKA facilitates axonal transport of dense core vesicles and autophagosomes in a PP2A-dependent fashion. In addition  CKA-deficient flies exhibit PP2A-dependent motor coordination defects. CKA function within the STRIPAK complex is crucial to prevent transport defects that may contribute to neurodegeneration. ,Autophagy_LIR

STING directly activates autophagy to tune the innate immune response.STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a central molecule that binds to cyclic dinucleotides produced by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to activate innate immunity against microbial infection. Here we report that STING harbors classic LC-3 interacting regions (LIRs) and mediates autophagy through its direct interaction with LC3. We observed that poly(dA:dT)  cGAMP  and HSV-1 induced STING-dependent autophagy and degradation of STING immediately after TBK1 activation. STING induces non-canonical autophagy that is dependent on ATG5  whereas other autophagy regulators such as Beclin1  Atg9a  ULK1  and p62 are dispensable. LIR mutants of STING abolished its interaction with LC3 and its activation of autophagy. Also  mutants that abolish STING dimerization and cGAMP-binding diminished the STING-LC3 interaction and subsequent autophagy  suggesting that STING activation is indispensable for autophagy induction. Our results thus uncover dual functions of STING in activating the immune response and autophagy  and suggest that STING is involved in ensuring a measured innate immune response. ,Autophagy_LIR

Lipidation-independent vacuolar functions of Atg8 rely on its noncanonical interaction with a vacuole membrane protein.The ubiquitin-like protein Atg8  in its lipidated form  plays central roles in autophagy. Yet  remarkably  Atg8 also carries out lipidation-independent functions in non-autophagic processes. How Atg8 performs its moonlighting roles is unclear. Here we report that in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>  the lipidation-independent roles of Atg8 in maintaining normal morphology and functions of the vacuole require its interaction with a vacuole membrane protein Hfl1 (homolog of human TMEM184 proteins). Crystal structures revealed that the Atg8-Hfl1 interaction is not mediated by the typical Atg8-family-interacting motif (AIM) that forms an intermolecular β-sheet with Atg8. Instead  the Atg8-binding regions in Hfl1 proteins adopt a helical conformation  thus representing a new type of AIMs (termed helical AIMs here). These results deepen our understanding of both the functional versatility of Atg8 and the mechanistic diversity of Atg8 binding. ,Autophagy_LIR

The pro-oxidant adaptor p66SHC promotes B cell mitophagy by disrupting mitochondrial integrity and recruiting LC3-II.Macroautophagy/autophagy has emerged as a central process in lymphocyte homeostasis  activation and differentiation. Based on our finding that the p66 isoform of SHC1 (p66SHC) pro-apoptotic ROS-elevating SHC family adaptor inhibits MTOR signaling in these cells  here we investigated the role of p66SHC in B-cell autophagy. We show that p66SHC disrupts mitochondrial function through its CYCS (cytochrome c  somatic) binding domain  thereby impairing ATP production  which results in AMPK activation and enhanced autophagic flux. While p66SHC binding to CYCS is sufficient for triggering apoptosis  p66SHC-mediated autophagy additionally depends on its ability to interact with membrane-associated LC3-II through a specific binding motif within its N terminus. Importantly  p66SHC also has an impact on mitochondria homeostasis by inducing mitochondrial depolarization  protein ubiquitination at the outer mitochondrial membrane  and local recruitment of active AMPK. These events initiate mitophagy  whose full execution relies on the role of p66SHC as an LC3-II receptor which brings phagophore membranes to mitochondria. Importantly  p66SHC also promotes hypoxia-induced mitophagy in B cells. Moreover  p66SHC deficiency enhances B cell differentiation to plasma cells  which is controlled by intracellular ROS levels and the hypoxic germinal center environment. The results identify mitochondrial p66SHC as a novel regulator of autophagy and mitophagy in B cells and implicate p66SHC-mediated coordination of autophagy and apoptosis in B cell survival and differentiation.

Characterization of the molecular mechanism of the autophagy-related Atg8-Atg3 protein interaction in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>.Toxoplasmosis is caused by an obligate intracellular parasite  the protozoan <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> Discovery of novel drugs against <i>T. gondii</i> infection could circumvent the toxicity of existing drugs and <i>T. gondii</i> resistance to current treatments. The autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8)-Atg3 interaction in <i>T. gondii</i> is a promising drug target because of its importance for regulating Atg8 lipidation. We reported previously that TgAtg8 and TgAtg3 interact directly. Here we validated that substitutions of conserved residues of TgAtg8 interacting with the Atg8 family-interacting motif (AIM) in Atg3 disrupt the TgAtg8-TgAtg3 interaction and reduce TgAtg8 lipidation and autophagosome formation. These findings were consistent with results reported previously for <i>Plasmodium</i> Atg8  suggesting functional conservation of Atg8 in <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Plasmodium.</i> Moreover  using peptide and AlphaScreen assays  we identified the AIM sequence in TgAtg3 that binds TgAtg8. We determined that the core TgAtg3 AIM contains a Phe<sup>239</sup>-Ala<sup>240</sup>-Asp<sup>241</sup>-Ile<sup>242</sup> (<sup>239</sup>FADI<sup>242</sup>) signature distinct from the <sup>105</sup>WLLP<sup>108</sup> signature in the AIM of <i>Plasmodium</i> Atg3. Furthermore  an alanine-scanning assay revealed that the TgAtg8-TgAtg3 interaction in <i>T. gondii</i> also depends strongly on several residues surrounding the core TgAtg3 AIM  such as Asn<sup>238</sup>  Asp<sup>243</sup>  and Cys<sup>244</sup> These results indicate that distinct AIMs in Atg3 contribute to differences between <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Plasmodium</i> Atg8-Atg3 interactions. By elucidating critical residues involved in the TgAtg8-TgAtg3 interaction  our work paves the way for the discovery of potential anti-toxoplasmosis drugs. The quantitative and straightforward AlphaScreen assay developed here may enable high-throughput screening for small molecules disrupting the TgAtg8-TgAtg3 interaction. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy Regulates the Liver Clock and Glucose Metabolism by Degrading CRY1.The circadian clock coordinates behavioral and circadian cues with availability and utilization of nutrients. Proteasomal degradation of clock repressors  such as cryptochrome (CRY)1  maintains periodicity. Whether macroautophagy  a quality control pathway  degrades circadian proteins remains unknown. Here we show that circadian proteins BMAL1  CLOCK  REV-ERBα  and CRY1 are lysosomal targets  and that macroautophagy affects the circadian clock by selectively degrading CRY1. Autophagic degradation of CRY1  an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis  occurs in a diurnal window when rodents rely on gluconeogenesis  suggesting that CRY1 degradation is time-imprinted to maintenance of blood glucose. High-fat feeding accelerates autophagic CRY1 degradation and contributes to obesity-associated hyperglycemia. CRY1 contains several light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting region (LIR) motifs  which facilitate the interaction of cargo proteins with the autophagosome marker LC3. Using mutational analyses  we identified two distinct LIRs on CRY1 that exert circadian glycemic control by regulating CRY1 degradation  revealing LIRs as potential targets for controlling hyperglycemia. ,Autophagy_LIR

Potent and specific Atg8-targeting autophagy inhibitory peptides from giant ankyrins.The mammalian Atg8 family proteins are central drivers of autophagy and contain six members  classified into the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies. Due to their high sequence similarity and consequent functional overlaps  it is difficult to delineate specific functions of Atg8 proteins in autophagy. Here we discover a super-strong GABARAP-selective inhibitory peptide harbored in 270/480 kDa ankyrin-G and a super-potent pan-Atg8 inhibitory peptide from 440 kDa ankyrin-B. Structural studies elucidate the mechanism governing the Atg8 binding potency and selectivity of the peptides  reveal a general Atg8-binding sequence motif  and allow development of a more GABARAP-selective inhibitory peptide. These peptides effectively blocked autophagy when expressed in cultured cells. Expression of these ankyrin-derived peptides in Caenorhabditis elegans also inhibited autophagy  causing accumulation of the p62 homolog SQST-1  delayed development and shortened life span. Thus  these genetically encodable autophagy inhibitory peptides can be used to occlude autophagy spatiotemporally in living animals. ,Autophagy_LIR

The interaction between IKKα and LC3 promotes type I interferon production through the TLR9-containing LAPosome.Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomes and activates distinct signaling pathways to stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that stimulate the production of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)  a form of noncanonical autophagy  is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the stimulation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides  the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not stimulated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation  which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition  we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα  and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover  mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN production in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together  these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN production. ,Autophagy_LIR

NUFIP1 is a ribosome receptor for starvation-induced ribophagy.The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules  signals to the master growth regulator mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1]  and is associated with human disease. We performed quantitative proteomic analyses of rapidly isolated lysosomes and found that nutrient levels and mTOR dynamically modulate the lysosomal proteome. Upon mTORC1 inhibition  NUFIP1 (nuclear fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 1) redistributes from the nucleus to autophagosomes and lysosomes. Upon these conditions  NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and delivers them to autophagosomes by directly binding to microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B). The starvation-induced degradation of ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) depends on the capacity of NUFIP1 to bind LC3B and promotes cell survival. We propose that NUFIP1 is a receptor for the selective autophagy of ribosomes. ,Autophagy_LIR

Beclin1 restricts RNA virus infection in plants through suppression and degradation of the viral polymerase.Autophagy emerges as an essential immunity defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we report that turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection activates autophagy in plants and that Beclin1 (ATG6)  a core component of autophagy  inhibits virus replication. Beclin1 interacts with NIb  the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of TuMV  via the highly conserved GDD motif and the interaction complex is targeted for autophagic degradation likely through the adaptor protein ATG8a. Beclin1-mediated NIb degradation is inhibited by autophagy inhibitors. Deficiency of Beclin1 or ATG8a enhances NIb accumulation and promotes viral infection and vice versa. These data suggest that Beclin1 may be a selective autophagy receptor. Overexpression of a Beclin1 truncation mutant that binds to NIb but lacks the ability to mediate NIb degradation also inhibits virus replication. The Beclin1-RdRp interaction further extends to several RNA viruses. Thus Beclin1 restricts viral infection through suppression and also likely autophagic degradation of the viral RdRp. ,Autophagy_LIR

Molecular mechanism to target the endosomal Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure.During autophagy  a newly formed double membrane surrounds its cargo to generate the so-called autophagosome  which then fuses with a lysosome after closure. Previous work implicated that endosomal Rab7/Ypt7 associates to autophagosomes prior to their fusion with lysosomes. Here  we unravel how the Mon1-Ccz1 guanosine exchange factor (GEF) acting upstream of Ypt7 is specifically recruited to the pre-autophagosomal structure under starvation conditions. We find that Mon1-Ccz1 directly binds to Atg8  the yeast homolog of the members of the mammalian LC3 protein family. This requires at least one LIR motif in the Ccz1 C-terminus  which is essential for autophagy but not for endosomal transport. In agreement  only wild-type  but not LIR-mutated Mon1-Ccz1 promotes Atg8-dependent activation of Ypt7. Our data reveal how GEF targeting can specify the fate of a newly formed organelle and provide new insights into the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. ,Autophagy_LIR

PHB2 interacts with LC3 and SQSTM1 is required for bile acids-induced mitophagy in cholestatic liver.Mitophagy is a major pathway for clearance of injured mitochondria. However  whether mitophagy is involved in the cholestasis-induced damages of hepatic mitochondria remains unknown. We here aimed to investigate the molecular links between cholestasis and hepatic mitophagy. We show that mitophagy is increased significantly in livers of biliary atresia (BA) that is cholestatic disease in infants. The mitochondrial-toxicity bile acids treatment increases the activities of mitophagy in hepatocytes. Mechanistically  we find that the prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is crucial for cholestasis-mediated mitophagy in vitro. On the one hand  PHB2 binds the autophagosomal membrane-associated protein LC3 upon injured mitochondria via an LC3-interaction region domain. On the other hand  PHB2 forms a ternary protein complex with sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and LC3  leading to loading of LC3 onto the damaged mitochondria. Altogether  our study suggests that PHB2 is required for cholestasis-induced mitophagy via LC3 onto the injured mitochondria. ,Autophagy_LIR

TGFB1 is secreted through an unconventional pathway dependent on the autophagic machinery and cytoskeletal regulators.TGFB1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) is a potent cytokine playing a driving role in development  fibrosis and cancer. It is synthesized as prodomain-growth factor complex that requires tethering to LTBP (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein) for efficient secretion into the extracellular space. Upon release  this large latent complex is sequestered by anchorage to extracellular matrix (ECM) networks  from which the mature growth factor needs to be activated in order to reach its receptors and initiate signaling. Here  we uncovered a novel intracellular secretion pathway by which the latent TGFB1 complex reaches the plasma membrane and is released from fibroblasts  the key effector cells during tissue repair  fibrosis and in the tumor stroma. We show that secretion of latent TGFB1  but not of other selected cytokines or of bulk cargo  is regulated by fibroblast-ECM communication through ILK (integrin linked kinase) that restricts RHOA activity by interacting with ARHGAP26/GRAF1. Latent TGFB1 interacts with GORASP2/GRASP55 and is detected inside MAP1LC3-positive autophagosomal intermediates that are secreted by a RAB8A-dependent pathway. Interestingly  TGFB1 secretion is fully abrogated in human and murine fibroblasts and macrophages that lack key components of the autophagic machinery. Our data demonstrate an unconventional secretion mode of TGFB1 adding another level of control of its bioavailability and activity in order to effectively orchestrate cellular programs prone to dysregulation as seen in fibrosis and cancer. ,Autophagy_LIR

Fas-apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 localizes to the lysosome and facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion through the LC3 interaction region motif-dependent interaction with LC3.Fas-apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) is a member of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) family. TMBIM family is comprised of six anti-apoptotic proteins that suppress cell death by regulating endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Recent studies have implicated two TMBIM proteins  GRINA and BAX Inhibitor-1  in mediating cytoprotection via autophagy. However  whether FAIM2 plays a role in autophagy has been unknown. Here we show that FAIM2 localizes to the lysosomes at basal state and facilitates autophagy through interaction with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 proteins in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. FAIM2 overexpression increased autophagy flux  while autophagy flux was impaired in shRNA-mediated knockdown (shFAIM2) cells  and the impairment was more evident in the presence of rapamycin. In shFAIM2 cells  autophagosome maturation through fusion with lysosomes was impaired  leading to accumulation of autophagosomes. A functional LC3-interacting region motif within FAIM2 was essential for the interaction with LC3 and rescue of autophagy flux in shFAIM2 cells while LC3-binding property of FAIM2 was dispensable for the anti-apoptotic function in response to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. Suppression of autophagosome maturation was also observed in a null mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans lacking xbx-6  the ortholog of FAIM2. Our study suggests that FAIM2 is a novel regulator of autophagy mediating autophagosome maturation through the interaction with LC3. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagic degradation of KAT2A/GCN5 promotes directional migration of vascular smooth muscle cells by reducing TUBA/α-tubulin acetylation.Macroautophagy/autophagy  a fundamental process for degradation of macromolecules and organelles  occurs constitutively at a basal level and is upregulated in response to stress. Whether autophagy regulates protein acetylation and microtubule stability in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migration  however  remains unknown. Here  we demonstrate that the histone acetyltransferase KAT2A/GCN5 (lysine acetyltransferase 2) binds directly to the autophagosome protein MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3) via a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) domain. This interaction is required for KAT2A sequestration in autophagosomes and degradation by lysosomal acid hydrolases. Suppression of autophagy results in KAT2A accumulation. KAT2A functions as an acetyltransferase to increase TUBA/α-tubulin acetylation  promote microtubule polymerization and stability  ultimately inhibiting directional cell migration. Our findings indicate that deacetylation of TUBA and perturbation of microtubule stability via selective autophagic degradation of KAT2A are essential for autophagy-promoting VSMC migration. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ACTB: actin beta; ATAT1: alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1; ATG: autophagy-related; BECN1: beclin 1; CQ: chloroquine; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GST: glutathione S-transferase; H4K16ac: histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation; HASMCs: human aortic smooth muscle cells; HBSS: Hank's buffered salt solution; HDAC6: histone deacetylase 6; hMOF: human males absent on the first; IP: immunoprecipitation; KAT2A/GCN5: lysine acetyltransferase 2A; Lacta: lactacystin; LIR: LC3-interaction region; MAP1LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; MTOC: microtubule-organizing center; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor 2; SIRT1: sirtuin 1; SIRT2: sirtuin 2; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle cells; WT: wild-type. ,Autophagy_LIR

NIMA-related kinase 9-mediated phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated LC3B protein at Thr-50 suppresses selective autophagy of p62/sequestosome 1.Human ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s) are active in all steps of the macroautophagy pathway  and their lipidation is essential for autophagosome formation. Lipidated ATG8s anchored to the outer surface of the phagophore serve as scaffolds for binding of other core autophagy proteins and various effector proteins involved in trafficking or fusion events  whereas those at the inner surface are needed for assembly of selective autophagy substrates. Their scaffolding role depends on specific interactions between the LC3-interacting region (LIR) docking site (LDS) in ATG8s and LIR motifs in various interaction partners. LC3B is phosphorylated at Thr-50 within the LDS by serine/threonine kinase (STK) 3 and STK4. Here  we identified LIR motifs in STK3 and atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase 9 (NEK9). All three kinases phosphorylated LC3B Thr-50 <i>in vitro</i> A phospho-mimicking substitution of Thr-50 impaired binding of several LIR-containing proteins  such as ATG4B  FYVE  and coiled-coil domain-containing 1 (FYCO1)  and autophagy cargo receptors p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and neighbor of BRCA1 gene (NBR1). NEK9 knockdown or knockout enhanced degradation of the autophagy receptor and substrate p62. Of note  the suppression of p62 degradation was mediated by NEK9-mediated phosphorylation of LC3B Thr-50. Consistently  reconstitution of LC3B-KO cells with the phospho-mimicking T50E variant inhibited autophagic p62 degradation. PKCζ knockdown did not affect autophagic p62 degradation  whereas STK3/4 knockouts inhibited autophagic p62 degradation independently of LC3B Thr-50 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that NEK9 suppresses LC3B-mediated autophagy of p62 by phosphorylating Thr-50 within the LDS of LC3B. ,Autophagy_LIR

Epstein-Barr Virus BALF0 and BALF1 Modulate Autophagy.Autophagy is an essential catabolic process that degrades cytoplasmic components within the lysosome  therefore ensuring cell survival and homeostasis. A growing number of viruses  including members of the Herpesviridae family  have been shown to manipulate autophagy to facilitate their persistence or optimize their replication. Previous works showed that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  a human transforming gammaherpesvirus  hijacked autophagy during the lytic phase of its cycle  possibly to favor the formation of viral particles. However  the viral proteins that are responsible for an EBV-mediated subversion of the autophagy pathways remain to be characterized. Here we provide the first evidence that the BALF0/1 open reading frame encodes for two conserved proteins of the Bcl-2 family  BALF0 and BALF1  that are expressed during the early phase of the lytic cycle and can modulate autophagy. A putative LC3-interacting region (LIR) has been identified that is required both for BALF1 colocalization with autophagosomes and for its ability to stimulate autophagy. ,Autophagy_LIR

The Microalga <i>Nannochloropsis</i> during Transition from Quiescence to Autotrophy in Response to Nitrogen Availability.The marine microalgae <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> (CCMP1779) is a prolific producer of oil and is considered a viable and sustainable resource for biofuel feedstocks. Nitrogen (N) availability has a strong impact on the physiological status and metabolism of microalgal cells  but the exact nature of this response is poorly understood. To fill this gap we performed transcriptomic profiling combined with cellular and molecular analyses of <i>N. oceanica</i> CCMP1779 during the transition from quiescence to autotrophy. N deprivation-induced quiescence was accompanied by a strong reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus and changes in the lipid homeostasis  leading to accumulation of triacylglycerol. Cell cycle activation and re-establishment of photosynthetic activity observed in response to resupply of the growth medium with N were accompanied by a rapid degradation of triacylglycerol stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Besides observing LD translocation into vacuoles  we also provide evidence for direct interaction between the LD surface protein (<i>No</i>LDSP) and AUTOPHAGY-RELATED8 (<i>No</i>ATG8) protein and show a role of microlipophagy in LD turnover in <i>N. oceanica</i> CCMP1779. This knowledge is crucial not only for understanding the fundamental mechanisms controlling the cellular energy homeostasis in microalgal cells but also for development of efficient strategies to achieve higher algal biomass and better microalgal lipid productivity. ,Autophagy_LIR

The Machado-Joseph disease deubiquitylase ataxin-3 interacts with LC3C/GABARAP and promotes autophagy.The pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3  also known as Machado-Joseph disease  is triggered by aggregation of toxic ataxin-3 (ATXN3) variants containing expanded polyglutamine repeats. The physiological role of this deubiquitylase  however  remains largely unclear. Our recent work showed that ATX-3  the nematode orthologue of ATXN3  together with the ubiquitin-directed segregase CDC-48  regulates longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here  we demonstrate that the long-lived cdc-48.1; atx-3 double mutant displays reduced viability under prolonged starvation conditions that can be attributed to the loss of catalytically active ATX-3. Reducing the levels of the autophagy protein BEC-1 sensitized worms to the effect of ATX-3 deficiency  suggesting a role of ATX-3 in autophagy. In support of this conclusion  the depletion of ATXN3 in human cells caused a reduction in autophagosomal degradation of proteins. Surprisingly  reduced degradation in ATXN3-depleted cells coincided with an increase in the number of autophagosomes while levels of lipidated LC3 remained unaffected. We identified two conserved LIR domains in the catalytic Josephin domain of ATXN3 that directly interacted with the autophagy adaptors LC3C and GABARAP in vitro. While ATXN3 localized to early autophagosomes  it was not subject to lysosomal degradation  suggesting a transient regulatory interaction early in the autophagic pathway. We propose that the deubiquitylase ATX-3/ATXN3 stimulates autophagic degradation by preventing superfluous initiation of autophagosomes  thereby promoting an efficient autophagic flux important to survive starvation. ,Autophagy_LIR

TEX264 Is an Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident ATG8-Interacting Protein Critical for ER Remodeling during Nutrient Stress.Cells respond to nutrient stress by trafficking cytosolic contents to lysosomes for degradation via macroautophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an initiation site for autophagosomes and is also remodeled in response to nutrient stress through ER-phagy  a form of selective autophagy. Quantitative proteome analysis during nutrient stress identified an unstudied single-pass transmembrane ER protein  TEX264  as an ER-phagy receptor. TEX264 uses an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to traffic into ATG8-positive puncta that often initiate from three-way ER tubule junctions and subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Interaction and proximity biotinylation proteomics identified a cohort of autophagy regulatory proteins and cargo adaptors located near TEX264 in an LIR-dependent manner. Global proteomics and ER-phagy flux analysis revealed the stabilization of a cohort of ER proteins in TEX264<sup>-/-</sup> cells during nutrient stress. This work reveals TEX264 as an unrecognized ER-phagy receptor that acts independently of other candidate ER-phagy receptors to remodel the ER during nutrient stress. ,Autophagy_LIR

An atypical LIR motif within UBA5 (ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 5) interacts with GABARAP proteins and mediates membrane localization of UBA5.Short linear motifs  known as LC3-interacting regions (LIRs)  interact with mactoautophagy/autophagy modifiers (Atg8/LC3/GABARAP proteins) via a conserved universal mechanism. Typically  this includes the occupancy of 2 hydrophobic pockets on the surface of Atg8-family proteins by 2 specific aromatic and hydrophobic residues within the LIR motifs. Here  we describe an alternative mechanism of Atg8-family protein interaction with the non-canonical UBA5 LIR  an E1-like enzyme of the ufmylation pathway that preferentially interacts with GABARAP but not LC3 proteins. By solving the structures of both GABARAP and GABARAPL2 in complex with the UBA5 LIR  we show that in addition to the binding to the 2 canonical hydrophobic pockets (HP1 and HP2)  a conserved tryptophan residue N-terminal of the LIR core sequence binds into a novel hydrophobic pocket on the surface of GABARAP proteins  which we term HP0. This mode of action is unique for UBA5 and accompanied by large rearrangements of key residues including the side chains of the gate-keeping K46 and the adjacent K/R47 in GABARAP proteins. Swapping mutations in LC3B and GABARAPL2 revealed that K/R47 is the key residue in the specific binding of GABARAP proteins to UBA5  with synergetic contributions of the composition and dynamics of the loop L3. Finally  we elucidate the physiological relevance of the interaction and show that GABARAP proteins regulate the localization and function of UBA5 on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in a lipidation-independent manner.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: AuTophaGy-related; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; GABARAP: GABA-type A receptor-associated protein; ITC: isothermal titration calorimetry; KO: knockout; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NMR: nuclear magnetic resonance; RMSD: root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions; TKO: triple knockout; UBA5: ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 5. ,Autophagy_LIR

Transcriptional regulation of autophagy-lysosomal function in BRAF-driven melanoma progression and chemoresistance.Autophagy maintains homeostasis and is induced upon stress. Yet  its mechanistic interaction with oncogenic signaling remains elusive. Here  we show that in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-melanoma  autophagy is induced by BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)  as part of a transcriptional program coordinating lysosome biogenesis/function  mediated by the TFEB transcription factor. TFEB is phosphorylated and thus inactivated by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> via its downstream ERK independently of mTORC1. BRAFi disrupts TFEB phosphorylation  allowing its nuclear translocation  which is synergized by increased phosphorylation/inactivation of the ZKSCAN3 transcriptional repressor by JNK2/p38-MAPK. Blockade of BRAFi-induced transcriptional activation of autophagy-lysosomal function in melanoma xenografts causes enhanced tumor progression  EMT-transdifferentiation  metastatic dissemination  and chemoresistance  which is associated with elevated TGF-β levels and enhanced TGF-β signaling. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling restores tumor differentiation and drug responsiveness in melanoma cells. Thus  the "BRAF-TFEB-autophagy-lysosome" axis represents an intrinsic regulatory pathway in BRAF-mutant melanoma  coupling BRAF signaling with TGF-β signaling to drive tumor progression and chemoresistance. ,Autophagy_LIR

Autophagy regulates lipid metabolism through selective turnover of NCoR1.Selective autophagy ensures the removal of specific soluble proteins  protein aggregates  damaged mitochondria  and invasive bacteria from cells. Defective autophagy has been directly linked to metabolic disorders. However how selective autophagy regulates metabolism remains largely uncharacterized. Here we show that a deficiency in selective autophagy is associated with suppression of lipid oxidation. Hepatic loss of Atg7 or Atg5 significantly impairs the production of ketone bodies upon fasting  due to decreased expression of enzymes involved in β-oxidation following suppression of transactivation by PPARα. Mechanistically  nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1)  which interacts with PPARα to suppress its transactivation  binds to the autophagosomal GABARAP family proteins and is degraded by autophagy. Consequently  loss of autophagy causes accumulation of NCoR1  suppressing PPARα activity and resulting in impaired lipid oxidation. These results suggest that autophagy contributes to PPARα activation upon fasting by promoting degradation of NCoR1 and thus regulates β-oxidation and ketone bodies production. ,Autophagy_LIR

Pejvakin-mediated pexophagy protects auditory hair cells against noise-induced damage.Noise overexposure causes oxidative stress  leading to auditory hair cell damage. Adaptive peroxisome proliferation involving pejvakin  a peroxisome-associated protein from the gasdermin family  has been shown to protect against this harmful oxidative stress. However  the role of pejvakin in peroxisome dynamics and homeostasis remains unclear. Here we show that sound overstimulation induces an early and rapid selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) in auditory hair cells from wild-type  but not pejvakin-deficient <i>(Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup>)  mice. Noise overexposure triggers recruitment of the autophagosome-associated protein MAP1LC3B (LC3B; microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β) to peroxisomes in wild-type  but not <i>Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup>  mice. We also show that pejvakin-LC3B binding involves an LC3-interacting region within the predicted chaperone domain of pejvakin. In transfected cells and in vivo transduced auditory hair cells  cysteine mutagenesis experiments demonstrated the requirement for both C328 and C343  the two cysteine residues closest to the C terminus of pejvakin  for reactive oxygen species-induced pejvakin-LC3B interaction and pexophagy. The viral transduction of auditory hair cells from <i>Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice in vivo with both Pjvk and Lc3b cDNAs completely restored sound-induced pexophagy  fully prevented the development of oxidative stress  and resulted in normal levels of peroxisome proliferation  whereas Pjvk cDNA alone yielded only a partial correction of the defects. Overall  our results demonstrate that pexophagy plays a key role in noise-induced peroxisome proliferation and identify defective pexophagy as a cause of noise-induced hearing loss. They suggest that pejvakin acts as a redox-activated pexophagy receptor/adaptor  thereby identifying a previously unknown function of gasdermin family proteins. ,Autophagy_LIR

Ubiquitination of MAP1LC3B by pVHL is associated with autophagy and cell death in renal cell carcinoma.Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) expression is significantly decreased in high-grade RCC  and autophagy  which is involved in tumor growth  invasion  differentiation  and metastasis  is activated in various human cancers. However  the relationship of autophagy and VHL in tumor progression remains controversial. Here  we showed that the expression levels of VHL and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (MAP1LC3B  LC3B) were inversely correlated with various tumor grades of RCC tissues. pVHL was found to possess the LIR motif within a beta domain that interacted with MAP1LC3B and ubiquitinated it. The L101A VHL mutant failed to interact with MAP1LC3B  thereby failing to induce ubiquitination. MAP1LC3B-mediated autophagy was inhibited by functional pVHL and the ubiquitination of MAPLC3B was implicated in autophagy-induced cell death. We screened various autophagy inducers to determine the physiological function of the inhibition of LC3B-mediated autophagy by pVHL using VHL-deficient and VHL-expressing cell lines. MLN9708  a proteasome inhibitor  potently induced autophagy via the induction of MAP1LC3B and sensitized the cell to autophagy-mediated cell death in VHL-deficient and VHL-mutant (L101A) cells. In conclusion  our results showed that pVHL interacts with MAPL1LC3B and inhibits LC3B-mediated autophagy via MAP1LC3B ubiquitination. Furthermore  the activation of autophagy by the proteasome inhibitor MLN9708 induced cell death  indicating that MLN9708 can be used for VHL-deficient RCC therapy. ,Autophagy_LIR

TRAF6 inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis through regulating selective autophagic CTNNB1/β-catenin degradation and is targeted for GSK3B/GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and degradation.Aberrant CTNNB1 signaling is one of the fundamental processes in cancers  especially colorectal cancer (CRC). Here  we reported that TRAF6  an E3 ubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling  inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC metastasis through driving a selective autophagic CTNNB1 degradation machinery. Mechanistically  TRAF6 interacted with MAP1LC3B/LC3B through its LC3-interacting region 'YxxL' and catalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of LC3B. The K63-linked ubiquitination of LC3B promoted the formation of the LC3B-ATG7 complex and was critical to the subsequent recognition of CTNNB1 by LC3B for the selective autophagic degradation. However  TRAF6 was phosphorylated at Thr266 by GSK3B in most clinical CRC  which triggered K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6 and thereby attenuated its inhibitory activity towards the autophagy-dependent CTNNB1 signaling. Clinically  decreased expression of TRAF6 was associated with elevated GSK3B protein levels and activity and reduced overall survival in CRC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B activity stabilized the TRAF6 protein  promoted CTNNB1 degradation  and effectively suppressed EMT and CRC metastasis. Thus  targeting TRAF6 and its pathway may be meaningful for treating advanced CRC. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; AOM: azoxymethane; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BECN1: beclin 1; CoIP: co-immunoprecipitation; CQ: chloroquine; CRC: colorectal cancer; CTNNB1/β-catenin: catenin beta 1; DSS: dextran sodium sulfate; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GSK3B/GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; IgG: Immunoglobulin G; IHC: immunohistochemistry; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RT: room temperature; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TRAF6: TNF receptor-associated factor 6; WT: wild-type; ZEB1: zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1. ,Autophagy_LIR

Listeria hijacks host mitophagy through a novel mitophagy receptor to evade killing.Cells use mitophagy to remove damaged or unwanted mitochondria to maintain homeostasis. Here we report that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes exploits host mitophagy to evade killing. We found that L. monocytogenes induced mitophagy in macrophages through the virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO). We discovered that NLRX1  the only Nod-like receptor (NLR) family member with a mitochondrial targeting sequence  contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and directly associated with LC3 through the LIR. NLRX1 and its LIR motif were essential for L. monocytogenes-induced mitophagy. NLRX1 deficiency and use of a mitophagy inhibitor both increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and thereby suppressed the survival of L. monocytogenes. Mechanistically  L. monocytogenes and LLO induced oligomerization of NLRX1 to promote binding of its LIR motif to LC3 for induction of mitophagy. Our study identifies NLRX1 as a novel mitophagy receptor and discovers a previously unappreciated strategy used by pathogens to hijack a host cell homeostasis system for their survival. ,Autophagy_LIR

ATL3 Is a Tubular ER-Phagy Receptor for GABARAP-Mediated Selective Autophagy.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of the nuclear envelope and both peripheral ER sheets and a peripheral tubular network [1  2]. In response to physiological or pathological conditions  receptor-mediated selective ER-phagy  engulfing specific ER subdomains or components  is essential for ER turnover and homeostasis [3-6]. Four mammalian receptors for ER-phagy have been reported: FAM134B [7]  reticulon 3 (RTN3) [8]  SEC62 [9]  and CCPG1 [10]. However  these ER-phagy receptors function in subcellular- and tissue- or physiological- and pathological-condition-specific manners  so the diversity of ER-phagy receptors and underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown [3  4]. Atlastins (ATL1  ATL2  and ATL3)  in mammals  are a class of membrane-bound  dynamin-like GTPases that function in ER fusion [11  12]. ATL1 is expressed mainly in the central nervous system  while ATL2 and ATL3 are more ubiquitously distributed [13]. Recent studies showed that ATL2 mainly affects ER morphology by promoting ER fusion  whereas alterations in ER morphology are hardly detectable after ATL3 depletion [14  15]. Here  we show that ATL3 functions as a receptor for ER-phagy  promoting tubular ER degradation upon starvation. ATL3 specifically binds to GABARAP  but not LC3  subfamily proteins via 2 GABARAP interaction motifs (GIMs). ATL3-GABARAP interaction is essential for ATL3 to function in ER-phagy. Moreover  hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN I)-associated ATL3 mutations (Y192C and P338R) disrupt ATL3's association with GABARAP and impair ATL3's function in ER-phagy  suggesting that defective ER-phagy is involved in HSAN I. Therefore  we reveal a new ATL3 function for GABARAP-mediated ER-phagy in the degradation of tubular ER. ,Autophagy_LIR

Members of the autophagy class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I interact with GABARAP and GABARAPL1 via LIR motifs.Autophagosome formation depends on a carefully orchestrated interplay between membrane-associated protein complexes. Initiation of macroautophagy/autophagy is mediated by the ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) protein kinase complex and the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PtdIns3K-C1). The latter contains PIK3C3/VPS34  PIK3R4/VPS15  BECN1/Beclin 1 and ATG14 and phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). Here  we show that PIK3C3  BECN1 and ATG14 contain functional LIR motifs and interact with the Atg8-family proteins with a preference for GABARAP and GABARAPL1. High resolution crystal structures of the functional LIR motifs of these core components of PtdIns3K-C1were obtained. Variation in hydrophobic pocket 2 (HP2) may explain the specificity for the GABARAP family. Mutation of the LIR motif in ATG14 did not prevent formation of the PtdIns3K-C1 complex  but blocked colocalization with MAP1LC3B/LC3B and impaired mitophagy. The ULK-mediated phosphorylation of S29 in ATG14 was strongly dependent on a functional LIR motif in ATG14. GABARAP-preferring LIR motifs in PIK3C3  BECN1 and ATG14 may  via coincidence detection  contribute to scaffolding of PtdIns3K-C1 on membranes for efficient autophagosome formation. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy-related; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GABARAPL1: GABA type A receptor associated protein like 1; GFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; KO: knockout; LDS: LIR docking site; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; PIK3C3: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PIK3R4: phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4; PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; VPS: Vacuolar protein sorting; ULK: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mitochondrial protein E2F3d  a distinctive E2F3 product  mediates hypoxia-induced mitophagy in cancer cells.Mitochondrial damage is caused by changes in the micro-environmental conditions during tumor progression. Cancer cells require mechanisms for mitochondrial quality control during this process; however  how mitochondrial integrity is maintained is unclear. Here we show that E2F3d  a previously unidentified E2F3 isoform  mediates hypoxia-induced mitophagy in cancer cells. Aberrant activity and expression of the E2F3 transcription factor is frequently observed in many cancer cells. Loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family function increases the expression of E2F3d and E2F3a. E2F3d localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane and its cytosolic domain contains an LC3-interacting region motif. Overexpression of E2F3d induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy  suggesting that E2F3d plays an important role in mitophagy. Furthermore  depletion of E2F3s attenuates hypoxia-induced mitophagy and increases intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species  which is reversed by the reintroduction of E2F3d. This study presents another key player that regulates mitochondrial quality control in cancer cells. ,Autophagy_LIR

The transmembrane autophagy cargo receptors ATI1 and ATI2 interact with ATG8 through intrinsically disordered regions with distinct biophysical properties.Selective autophagy has emerged as an important mechanism by which eukaryotic cells control the abundance of specific proteins. This mechanism relies on cargo recruitment to autophagosomes by receptors that bind to both the ubiquitin-like AUTOPHAGY8 (ATG8) protein through ATG8-interacting motifs (AIMs) and to the cargo to be degraded. In plants  two autophagy cargo receptors  ATG8-interacting protein 1 (ATI1) and 2 (ATI2)  were identified early on  but their molecular properties remain poorly understood. Here  we show that ATI1 and ATI2 are transmembrane proteins with long N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The N-terminal IDRs contain the functional AIMs  and we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to directly observe the disorder-order transition of the AIM upon ATG8 binding. Our analyses also show that the IDRs of ATI1 and ATI2 are not equivalent  because ATI2 has properties of a fully disordered polypeptide  while ATI1 has properties more consistent with a collapsed pre-molten globule-like conformation  possibly as a consequence of a higher content of π-orbital-containing amino acid residues. Finally  we show that a sizable fraction of ATI2  but not ATI1  is phosphorylated <i>in planta</i>. ,Autophagy_LIR

A Selective Autophagy Pathway for Phase-Separated Endocytic Protein Deposits.Autophagy eliminates cytoplasmic content selected by autophagy receptors  which link cargo to the membrane-bound autophagosomal ubiquitin-like protein Atg8/LC3. Here  we report a selective autophagy pathway for protein condensates formed by endocytic proteins in yeast. In this pathway  the endocytic protein Ede1 functions as a selective autophagy receptor. Distinct domains within Ede1 bind Atg8 and mediate phase separation into condensates. Both properties are necessary for an Ede1-dependent autophagy pathway for endocytic proteins  which differs from regular endocytosis and does not involve other known selective autophagy receptors but requires the core autophagy machinery. Cryo-electron tomography of Ede1-containing condensates  at the plasma membrane and in autophagic bodies  shows a phase-separated compartment at the beginning and end of the Ede1-mediated selective autophagy route. Our data suggest a model for autophagic degradation of macromolecular protein complexes by the action of intrinsic autophagy receptors. ,Autophagy_LIR

Pharmacological targeting of MCL-1 promotes mitophagy and improves disease pathologies in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.There is increasing evidence that inducing neuronal mitophagy can be used as a therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease. Here  we screen a library of 2024 FDA-approved drugs or drug candidates  revealing UMI-77 as an unexpected mitophagy activator. UMI-77 is an established BH3-mimetic for MCL-1 and was developed to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. We found that at sub-lethal doses  UMI-77 potently induces mitophagy  independent of apoptosis. Our mechanistic studies discovered that MCL-1 is a mitophagy receptor and directly binds to LC3A. Finally  we found that UMI-77 can induce mitophagy in vivo and that it effectively reverses molecular and behavioral phenotypes in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms of mitophagy  reveal that MCL-1 is a mitophagy receptor that can be targeted to induce mitophagy  and identify MCL-1 as a drug target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease. ,Autophagy_LIR

Atg43 tethers isolation membranes to mitochondria to promote starvation-induced mitophagy in fission yeast.Degradation of mitochondria through mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial function. In this study  we identified that Atg43  a mitochondrial outer membrane protein  serves as a mitophagy receptor in the model organism <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> to promote the selective degradation of mitochondria. Atg43 contains an Atg8-family-interacting motif essential for mitophagy. Forced recruitment of Atg8 to mitochondria restores mitophagy in Atg43-deficient cells  suggesting that Atg43 tethers expanding isolation membranes to mitochondria. We found that the mitochondrial import factors  including the Mim1-Mim2 complex and Tom70  are crucial for mitophagy. Artificial mitochondrial loading of Atg43 bypasses the requirement of the import factors  suggesting that they contribute to mitophagy through Atg43. Atg43 not only maintains growth ability during starvation but also facilitates vegetative growth through its mitophagy-independent function. Thus  Atg43 is a useful model to study the mechanism and physiological roles  as well as the origin and evolution  of mitophagy in eukaryotes. ,Autophagy_LIR

Age-dependent loss of adipose Rubicon promotes metabolic disorders via excess autophagy.The systemic decline in autophagic activity with age impairs homeostasis in several tissues  leading to age-related diseases. A mechanistic understanding of adipocyte dysfunction with age could help to prevent age-related metabolic disorders  but the role of autophagy in aged adipocytes remains unclear. Here we show that  in contrast to other tissues  aged adipocytes upregulate autophagy due to a decline in the levels of Rubicon  a negative regulator of autophagy. Rubicon knockout in adipocytes causes fat atrophy and hepatic lipid accumulation due to reductions in the expression of adipogenic genes  which can be recovered by activation of PPARγ. SRC-1 and TIF2  coactivators of PPARγ  are degraded by autophagy in a manner that depends on their binding to GABARAP family proteins  and are significantly downregulated in Rubicon-ablated or aged adipocytes. Hence  we propose that age-dependent decline in adipose Rubicon exacerbates metabolic disorders by promoting excess autophagic degradation of SRC-1 and TIF2. ,Autophagy_LIR

Ribosome profiling reveals a functional role for autophagy in mRNA translational control.Autophagy promotes protein degradation  and therefore has been proposed to maintain amino acid pools to sustain protein synthesis during metabolic stress. To date  how autophagy influences the protein synthesis landscape in mammalian cells remains unclear. Here  we utilize ribosome profiling to delineate the effects of genetic ablation of the autophagy regulator  ATG12  on translational control. In mammalian cells  genetic loss of autophagy does not impact global rates of cap dependent translation  even under starvation conditions. Instead  autophagy supports the translation of a subset of mRNAs enriched for cell cycle control and DNA damage repair. In particular  we demonstrate that autophagy enables the translation of the DNA damage repair protein BRCA2  which is functionally required to attenuate DNA damage and promote cell survival in response to PARP inhibition. Overall  our findings illuminate that autophagy impacts protein translation and shapes the protein landscape. ,Autophagy_LIR

Super-assembly of ER-phagy receptor Atg40 induces local ER remodeling at contacts with forming autophagosomal membranes.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is selectively degraded by autophagy (ER-phagy) through proteins called ER-phagy receptors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Atg40 acts as an ER-phagy receptor to sequester ER fragments into autophagosomes by binding Atg8 on forming autophagosomal membranes. During ER-phagy  parts of the ER are morphologically rearranged  fragmented  and loaded into autophagosomes  but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we find that Atg40 molecules assemble in the ER membrane concurrently with autophagosome formation via multivalent interaction with Atg8. Atg8-mediated super-assembly of Atg40 generates highly-curved ER regions  depending on its reticulon-like domain  and supports packing of these regions into autophagosomes. Moreover  tight binding of Atg40 to Atg8 is achieved by a short helix C-terminal to the Atg8-family interacting motif  and this feature is also observed for mammalian ER-phagy receptors. Thus  this study significantly advances our understanding of the mechanisms of ER-phagy and also provides insights into organelle fragmentation in selective autophagy of other organelles. ,Autophagy_LIR

Regulation of Expression of Autophagy Genes by Atg8a-Interacting Partners Sequoia  YL-1  and Sir2 in Drosophila.Autophagy is the degradation of cytoplasmic material through the lysosomal pathway. One of the most studied autophagy-related proteins is LC3. Despite growing evidence that LC3 is enriched in the nucleus  its nuclear role is poorly understood. Here  we show that Drosophila Atg8a protein  homologous to mammalian LC3  interacts with the transcription factor Sequoia in a LIR motif-dependent manner. We show that Sequoia depletion induces autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions through the enhanced expression of autophagy genes. We show that Atg8a interacts with YL-1  a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex  and that it is acetylated in nutrient-rich conditions. We also show that Atg8a interacts with the deacetylase Sir2  which deacetylates Atg8a during starvation to activate autophagy. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation of the expression of autophagy genes by Atg8a  which is linked to its acetylation status and its interaction with Sequoia  YL-1  and Sir2. ,Autophagy_LIR

A signaling hub of insulin receptor  dystrophin glycoprotein complex and plakoglobin regulates muscle size.Signaling through the insulin receptor governs central physiological functions related to cell growth and metabolism. Here we show by tandem native protein complex purification approach and super-resolution STED microscopy that insulin receptor activity requires association with the fundamental structural module in muscle  the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC)  and the desmosomal component plakoglobin (γ-catenin). The integrity of this high-molecular-mass assembly renders skeletal muscle susceptibility to insulin  because DGC-insulin receptor dissociation by plakoglobin downregulation reduces insulin signaling and causes atrophy. Furthermore  low insulin receptor activity in muscles from transgenic or fasted mice decreases plakoglobin-DGC-insulin receptor content on the plasma membrane  but not when plakoglobin is overexpressed. By masking β-dystroglycan LIR domains  plakoglobin prevents autophagic clearance of plakoglobin-DGC-insulin receptor co-assemblies and maintains their function. Our findings establish DGC as a signaling hub  and provide a possible mechanism for the insulin resistance in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  and for the cardiomyopathies seen with plakoglobin mutations. ,Autophagy_LIR

Influenza A virus protein PB1-F2 impairs innate immunity by inducing mitophagy.Influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces mitophagy  which is essential for the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondria can be selectively targeted by PINK1  which recruits PRKN/PARK2 and leads to subsequent mitochondrial sequestration within autophagosomes. The IAV PB1-F2 protein translocates to mitochondria  accelerates the mitochondrial fragmentation and impairs the innate immunity. However  whether PB1-F2 mediates IAV-induced mitophagy and the relation between mitophagy and PB1-F2-attenuated innate immunity remain obscure. Here  we showed that PB1-F2 translocated to mitochondria by interacting and colocalizing with TUFM (Tu translation elongation factor  mitochondrial). Further studies revealed that PB1-F2 induced complete mitophagy  which required the interactions of PB1-F2 with both TUFM and MAP1LC3B/LC3B that mediated the autophagosome formation. PB1-F2-induced mitophagy was critical for the MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) degradation and led to its suppression of the type I IFN production. Importantly  the C-terminal LIR motif of PB1-F2 protein was demonstrated to be essential for its mitophagy induction and attenuated innate immunity. In conclusion  PB1-F2-induced mitophagy strongly correlates with impaired cellular innate immunity  revealing it is a potential therapeutic target.<b>Abbreviations:</b> BCL2L13: BCL2 like 13; BECN1: beclin 1; BNIP3L/Nix: BCL2 interacting protein 3 like; CQ: chloroquine; DDX58: DExD/H-box helicase 58; eGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; hpi: hours post infection; IAV: influenza A virus; IFN: interferon; IP: immunoprecipitation; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; MOI  multiplicity of infection; mRFP: monomeric red fluorescent protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NC: negative control; NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; PRKN/PARK2: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RLR: RIG-I-like-receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SEV: sendai virus; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TM: transmembrane; TOMM20/40: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20/40; TUFM: Tu translation elongation factor  mitochondrial. ,Autophagy_LIR

Reticulon proteins modulate autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum in maize endosperm.Reticulon (Rtn) proteins shape tubular domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  and in some cases are autophagy receptors for selective ER turnover. We have found that maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 control ER homeostasis and autophagic flux in endosperm aleurone cells  where the ER accumulates lipid droplets and synthesizes storage protein accretions metabolized during germination. Maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 are expressed in the endosperm  localize to the ER  and re-model ER architecture in a dose-dependent manner. Rtn1 and Rtn2 interact with Atg8a using four Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs) located at the C-terminus  cytoplasmic loop  and within the transmembrane segments. Binding between Rtn2 and Atg8 is elevated upon ER stress. Maize <i>rtn2</i> mutants display increased autophagy and up-regulation of an ER stress-responsive chaperone. We propose that maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 act as receptors for autophagy-mediated ER turnover  and thus are critical for ER homeostasis and suppression of ER stress. ,Autophagy_LIR

A conserved ATG2-GABARAP family interaction is critical for phagophore formation.The intracellular trafficking pathway  macroautophagy  is a recycling and disposal service that can be upregulated during periods of stress to maintain cellular homeostasis. An essential phase is the elongation and closure of the phagophore to seal and isolate unwanted cargo prior to lysosomal degradation. Human ATG2A and ATG2B proteins  through their interaction with WIPI proteins  are thought to be key players during phagophore elongation and closure  but little mechanistic detail is known about their function. We have identified a highly conserved motif driving the interaction between human ATG2 and GABARAP proteins that is in close proximity to the ATG2-WIPI4 interaction site. We show that the ATG2A-GABARAP interaction mutants are unable to form and close phagophores resulting in blocked autophagy  similar to ATG2A/ATG2B double-knockout cells. In contrast  the ATG2A-WIPI4 interaction mutant fully restored phagophore formation and autophagy flux  similar to wild-type ATG2A. Taken together  we provide new mechanistic insights into the requirements for ATG2 function at the phagophore and suggest that an ATG2-GABARAP/GABARAP-L1 interaction is essential for phagophore formation  whereas ATG2-WIPI4 interaction is dispensable. ,Autophagy_LIR

Mass spectrometry proteomics reveals a function for mammalian CALCOCO1 in MTOR-regulated selective autophagy.Macroautophagy/autophagy is suppressed by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) and is an anticancer target under active investigation. Yet  MTOR-regulated autophagy remains incompletely mapped. We used proteomic profiling to identify proteins in the MTOR-autophagy axis. Wild-type (WT) mouse cell lines and cell lines lacking individual autophagy genes (<i>Atg5</i> or <i>Ulk1/Ulk2</i>) were treated with an MTOR inhibitor to induce autophagy and cultured in media with either glucose or galactose. Mass spectrometry proteome profiling revealed an elevation of known autophagy proteins and candidates for new autophagy components  including CALCOCO1 (calcium binding and coiled-coil domain protein 1). We show that CALCOCO1 physically interacts with MAP1LC3C  a key protein in the machinery of autophagy. Genetic deletion of <i>CALCOCO1</i> disrupted autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (reticulophagy). Together  these results reveal a role for CALCOCO1 in MTOR-regulated selective autophagy. More generally  the resource generated by this work provides a foundation for establishing links between the MTOR-autophagy axis and proteins not previously linked to this pathway. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy-related; CALCOCO1: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain protein 1; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain protein 2; CLIR: MAP1LC3C-interacting region; CQ: chloroquine; KO: knockout; LIR: MAP1LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MLN: MLN0128 ATP-competitive MTOR kinase inhibitor; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; reticulophagy: selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum; TAX1BP1/CALCOCO3: TAX1 binding protein 1; ULK: unc 51-like autophagy activating kinase; WT: wild-type. ,Autophagy_LIR

TECPR1 promotes aggrephagy by direct recruitment of LC3C autophagosomes to lysosomes.The accumulation of protein aggregates is involved in the onset of many neurodegenerative diseases. Aggrephagy is a selective type of autophagy that counteracts neurodegeneration by degrading such aggregates. In this study  we found that LC3C cooperates with lysosomal TECPR1 to promote the degradation of disease-related protein aggregates in neural stem cells. The N-terminal WD-repeat domain of TECPR1 selectively binds LC3C which decorates matured autophagosomes. The interaction of LC3C and TECPR1 promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Augmented expression of TECPR1 in neural stem cells reduces the number of protein aggregates by promoting their autophagic clearance  whereas knockdown of LC3C inhibits aggrephagy. The PH domain of TECPR1 selectively interacts with PtdIns(4)P to target TECPR1 to PtdIns(4)P containing lysosomes. Exchanging the PH against a tandem-FYVE domain targets TECPR1 ectopically to endosomes. This leads to an accumulation of LC3C autophagosomes at endosomes and prevents their delivery to lysosomes. ,Autophagy_LIR

Cytoplasmic short linear motifs in ACE2 and integrin β<sub>3</sub> link SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptors to mediators of endocytosis and autophagy.The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface and subsequently enters host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved  including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here  we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin β<sub>3</sub> with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27  NHERF3  and SHANK  and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore  we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin β<sub>3</sub> bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and propagation. ,Autophagy_LIR
